00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.066
What happened, Mr. Su?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.800
When Xiaohui had surgery 15 years ago

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.333
I told you to deal with it.

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.400
How do you deal with it?

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.100
I buried it, I buried it with my own hands

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.666
Are you sure he was already dead?

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.200
The young lady was only 4 years old at that time

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.733
Just had surgery and was buried in the wilderness

9
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.366
There was no chance of survival.

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.166
But Zhou Wenmei called and told me

11
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.333
He found 100 million

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.700
And brought him back home

13
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.800
Impossible, Mr. Su

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.000
You have to believe me.

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.366
Okay, can't be it?

16
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.766
Whether it's true or not, I'll know when I go back and read it now.

17
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.533
If I find out that you lied to me

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.033
You know what the consequences are.

19
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.800
Someone is definitely impersonating Miss Su

20
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.366
Can I go now?

21
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.000
It's not that easy to leave

22
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.700
1,000 bucks for a glass of wine

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.300
Just 20,000

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.466
There's 30,000 left

25
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.900
You pick up the plate for me

26
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.266
1,000 per plate.

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.066
Go for the old rules

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200
Brother, you don't know Yiyi, you are Yiyi.

29
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.666
His name is Xiaohong

30
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.666
Xiaohong has been in bad health

31
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.666
No alcohol, no strenuous exercise

32
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.266
So he can't swim at all.

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.700
If you are not in good health, you can't drink alcohol, and you can't exercise vigorously.

34
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.400
Isn't it the same as Brother Hui?

35
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.266
Brother Hui is because of bad kidneys

36
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.900
Then his kidneys are fine

37
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600
Could it be kidney deficiency?

38
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.133
Hahaha, your little name is Yiyi.

39
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.466
Just like me, your health is not good.

40
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.533
Same as me.

41
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.166
A wild girl from the countryside

42
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.066
What qualifications do you have to be like us?

43
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:34.900
You can't swim, can you?

44
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.600
Come on, come on, go get the plate back for me

45
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.000
This young master will give you 10,000 yuan, and you have to pick it up today.

46
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You have to pick it up

47
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.566
He really can't swim

48
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.633
Shouldn't it kill anyone?

49
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:54.733
Don't worry

50
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:55.966
Mom knows I'm not well

51
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:57.533
The pool wasn't dug deep

52
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.466
Smoke is unnatural

53
00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.900
Hey, because do you remember?

54
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.633
When you were a child, you liked to play with water the most.

55
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.000
You checked this pool

56
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.900
Mom asked him to find someone to give it to you.

57
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.100
Really? I can't seem to remember exactly.

58
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.833
The warrior you pestered Mr. Zhou to dig when you were a child

59
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.866
Now let Master Su push you down with his own hands

60
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.700
That's great.

61
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.400
Yiyi, look, dad is here

62
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.833
Come on. I'll take you to him

63
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.800
Don't go

64
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.100
Dad?

65
00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:28.600
who is he?

66
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:30.133
He is one by one

67
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:30.866
And my sister.

68
00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:32.100
Your daughter?

69
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.966
My mom and I have been looking for him for 15 years

70
00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.300
Finally found him

71
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.833
Call it dad

72
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.366
You are not Yiyi

73
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.866
Not my daughter.

74
00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:44.833
Dad, I

75
00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.666
I know my daughter

76
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.600
You still want to deceive me
