Dean Sun, is what you said true?

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.633
If he is willing to cooperate with the victim

3
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.900
I also did my best to save his

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.633
Ah he, we'll find him now

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.766
As long as I can save my face

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm willing to do anything

7
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.166
If you can't find the holy fate

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.433
Just use ours to dig mine out and give it back to him

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.466
Ah wrong I was wrong

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.000
What about younger brother?

11
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.966
What are you doing?

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.033
What about younger brother?

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.200
He's already gone.

14
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.900
Where did it go?

15
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.366
He found his birth parents

16
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.133
Live a happy life with them

17
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.800
If you still want to trouble him

18
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.233
Just come at me
