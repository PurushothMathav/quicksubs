00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.000
I go ahead

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.860
You follow me behind. Hmm

3
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.340
This wavering should be made by humans, and it should be a long time ago

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.200
You can see it

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.100
When did big brother become so smart

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.500
Oops big brother

7
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.520

Don't you have the money and experience to go to the kiln? It makes sense, okay

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.380
Find a trap, okay

13
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.900
I seem to have quarreled with the real and fake so fast

14
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.480
Are you saying that the people involved in this trap are insulting our intelligence? This won't be a trap

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.540
Hey, why are you here

16
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.180
How is this possible?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.740
