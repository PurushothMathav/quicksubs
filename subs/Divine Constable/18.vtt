1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.000
There's actually a room here

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.980
This looks like a woman's boudoir

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.140
But what kind of woman would live in a place like this?

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.040
Compared to who lives here

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm more curious about why the clues left by the second uncle point here

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.800
Forget it. We don't have much time

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.460
Hurry up and find clues

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.220
Find it separately

9
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.780
Why are there so many children's clothes?

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100
Brother, come and see what I found

11
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.140
In 1992, Handong was suspected of rebellion

12
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.540
The court ordered to send someone to attack the bag

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.980
The Chu family does not obey

14
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.000
A war broke out between the two sides

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.780
The Last Man

16
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.180
Full of doors

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.460
Please two years

18
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.980
Chu Jiang

19
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.020
But it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Sun family.

20
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.740
Does it matter? Just go back and check it out.

21
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.020
This case should have been judged by the Criminal Department back then

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.160
There are files in the Criminal Department

23
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.020
I'll suddenly check it when I go back.

24
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.860
What's wrong big brother

25
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.380
It's nothing, I should be overthinking it. Let's go
