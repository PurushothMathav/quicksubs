00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.060
Oops bro

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.500
What happened in such a hurry?

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.360
Chu Shuhan has a problem with her identity

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.240
How is that possible?

5
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.960
If there is a problem with his identity, will Mr. Jin Zheng not know?

6
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.600
It's true. I just got the news.

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.060
Chu Shuhan was the one who took care of things back then

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.520
What was it that the second uncle led the troops to destroy the whole family?

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.360
How could the other party not come for revenge?

10
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.080
I even suspect that the second uncle's preview is not what the Sun family said was done by Chu Shuhan at all

11
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.000
How is that possible?

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.480
Not so much for now.

13
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.080
It's important to find Yu'er

14
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.740
Then let's find it separately.

15
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.180
Brother Qin Yue

16
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.120
Your kitchen knife at home is broken.

17
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.860
I'm out looking for someone to fix it

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.780
By the way, big brother, why were you so excited just now? What happened?

19
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.280
What about Chu Chuhan?

20
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.980
He just said that he has something in the mansion and needs to go back and get it.

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.140
Brother, you didn't make a special trip to find him, did you?

22
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.140
Chu Chuhan is home

23
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.320
Yeah, what's wrong?

24
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.780
It's not good to be so coincidental, second uncle
