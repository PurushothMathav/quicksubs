00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.180
What's wrong with me?

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.100
No, I was beaten and kidnapped

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.460
This girl is so pretty

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.380
I just said your breasts are big and soft

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.460
How comfortable!

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.380
Why didn't you call me together?

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.720
What are you thinking?

8
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.740
He's also a chef

9
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.740
Nonsense crop monkey daughter still thorns boudoir

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.180
Did I know he was a chef?

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.700
They actually know my identity

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.980
Hey, what do you think Mr. Sun will do with this woman?

13
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.380
Although it is a collection of outstanding beauties

14
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.620
But it doesn't seem safe to keep it

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.500
You think too much

16
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.900
Mr. Sun will play for a while at most

17
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.320
If you get tired of it, you strangle it.

18
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.800
Buried in this yard

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.680
Who knows?

20
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.160
Wait for Mr. Sun to get tired of playing

21
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.640
Let's have a few sips of soup

22
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.000
This bitch has tender skin

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.140
More watery than the woman in Goulan

24
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.700
It's just that if Mr. Sun didn't want to try it

25
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.200
Let's do it for him now.

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.500
Who says it's not?

27
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.300
Who makes people a son who can't get married?

28
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.720
Hey, enough is enough

29
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.760
Go for a drink

30
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.540
Is drinking bad?

31
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.900
Why do you have to wake up?

32
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.960
Don't worry, I just got drugged.

33
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.880
I'll never wake up until night

34
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060
All right, let's go. Let's go.

35
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.000
No, can't sit still

36
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.440
Gotta go see when they're out

37
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.820
Find a way to escape

38
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780
It was locked
