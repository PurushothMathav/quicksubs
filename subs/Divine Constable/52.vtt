00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.500
Brother Qin, you and I are brothers after all

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.300
That's why I brought it for you to hold by yourself

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.340
Do you think all the torture instruments in this prison are vegetarian?

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.240
I advise you.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.340
Don't make it too difficult for me

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.220
After all, my father gave the order to die

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.300
We must eradicate the weeds

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.260
I want to protect you

9
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.620
But a lot of effort

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.860
It seems

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.760
You are sure of me

12
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.100
Hahaha, what about otherwise?

13
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.140
Sun Qian, Sun Qian

14
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.920
Now that you know I'm smart

15
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.940
Then how dare you underestimate me so much?

16
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.660
Do you think I really don't know who you are?

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.940
What do you mean?

18
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.340
I guessed when the original ledger was missed

19
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.440
If the Sun family had known the whereabouts of the accounting department long ago

20
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.500
It's impossible to take a risk against my second uncle in the prison

21
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.640
So I'm sure you must have found it after my second uncle had an accident

22
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.040
But after my second uncle had an accident

23
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.500
No one in the world knows the whereabouts of that ledger

24
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.360
Only the cockscomb river

25
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.560
And I hide the Cockscomb River very strictly

26
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.800
Except for the three of us Qin family

27
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.940
Only you have touched Sun Qian

28
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.140
So I don't doubt who you suspect

29
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.980
So what?

30
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.460
You have no evidence

31
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.680
Does mere suspicion convict me?

32
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.820
Yes, but you forgot that I've been to the Guozi ship

33
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.260
I also saw the traitor
