It's not good

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.260
Officers and soldiers from the Criminal Department suddenly broke in

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.420

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.160
Handsome guy alone?

11
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.440
Do you want your sister to accompany you for a drink?

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.620
My sister drinks well

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.180

17
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.700
Blocking other customers from parking

18
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.060
Bicycle misunderstanding

19
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.120
What bicycle?

20
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.920

I calm down your mother

24
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.820
Your husband is too cruel

25
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.240
Sir, are you all right?

26
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.300
Gu Jiayuan

27
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.880

What the hell do I rely on

30
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.200
I thought I was drinking at a bar

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.900
How did you run to prison? Ancient costumes

32
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.080
Shit

33
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.580
I couldn't have been kidnapped by some pervert, could I?

34
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.780
Not hello

35
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.860
Hello? Hello?

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.260
I don't want to die here

38
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.660
Somebody! Anybody?

39
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.980

40
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.040
What are you shouting?

41
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.700
Shout again and break your legs

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.140
Hey, your second uncle is suspected of arson and murder and murdering the court official

45
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.860

47
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.280
You still want to spend money on things

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.460
Dream on.

49
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.820
