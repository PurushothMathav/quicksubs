00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.280
What about my husband? Why hasn't my husband come yet?

2
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.520
My brother has his own work to do

3
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.740
If Sister Chu, you had to live in Qinling last night

4
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.780
Does Sister Qin not have a place to live?

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.240
My sister has taken pictures.

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.680
I am my husband's wife

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.020
Where else can I live if I don't live on his night?

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.620
You hey hey hey you calm down

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.220
Calm down, everyone is here

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.740
Don't wait for me, eat now

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.680
Hey

12
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.520
Who the hell is sick? Put the snake on my bed

13
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220
Don't you know that I am most afraid of snakes?

14
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.240
But you can quietly put snakes on my bed

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.080
The person who started it might be hiding in the house

16
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.960
Don't say anything until the investigation is clear

17
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.180
So as not to startle the snake

18
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.680
What were you discussing?

19
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.940
I heard it outside the hospital

20
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.260
What just now?

21
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.340
Uh no nothing

22
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.600
Husband, this is the shrimp I made with my own hands

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.940
You try it thank you

24
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.800
Big brother

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.780
This is the beef braised by my little sister herself.

26
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
They're delicious!

27
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.000
What's so good about good beef?

28
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.960
My shrimp are healthy and nutritious

29
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.180
My beef keeps me fit

30
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.660
Eat my own

31
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.960
My, my.

32
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.900
My oops is enough

33
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.400
Well, I'm going out for a walk.

34
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.980
Eat slowly, bro
