00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay, stop pretending

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.100
I still don't know who you are

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.380
Seriously.

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.680
I'm going on this trip too

5
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.760
What are you going to do?

6
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.640
If you leave, who will see the situation?

7
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.580
Besides, are you willing to let the second aunt take care of the second uncle alone?

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.040
But nothing but you

9
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.140
You are not allowed to go either

10
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.640
If a girl really encounters any danger on the way home

11
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.160
Should I protect myself or protect you?

12
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.500
I don't need your insurance

13
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.900
Nice to say, I really thought I was Barbie

14
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.460
Hey, good swordsmanship brother, don't be cowardly, get out

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.800
Okay, don't be upset.

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.880
Someone has to watch the house, okay okay

17
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.200
Then be careful on your way

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.240
Go early and come back early

19
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.520
Don't worry, there is a sister-in-law here

20
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.780
It's gonna be okay.

21
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.020
Gone, big brother

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.820
You must stay away from that woman this time

23
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.840
Why is that?

24
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.220
I always feel that he is not a good person oh oh yes

25
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.140
Big brother has something for you to do

26
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.580
What's up

27
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.320
Don't worry.

28
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.980
Ask the big brother to do what he says, okay?
