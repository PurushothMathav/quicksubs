00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.540
In fact, there was nothing missing from the tent cloth.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.860
Here I am.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.740
How is that possible?

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.240
If this is true

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.580
The book in the secret room

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.460
It's also true.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.860
But

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.300
I copied it by hand

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.420
I specially saved this hand

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.060
I thought I was prepared

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.300
I didn't expect

12
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.900
He really needed it that day.

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.080
So what are you waiting for?

14
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.820
We're going to report him now

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.780
What do you mean?

16
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.940
What's the problem?

17
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.500
My stupid son thought it was so easy to be brought down from the first rank

18
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.740
If it were as simple as you say

19
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.660
My father has already reported it.

20
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.940
How could it fall into this field today?

21
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.660
But isn't that what you usually do when you report some officials?

22
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.060
Ordinary officials are right to do so

23
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.760
But Sun Li is the official of the Ministry of Disaster

24
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.860
unreached minister

25
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.340
There are countless North Korean and Chinese maids

26
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.860
Unless well-prepared

27
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.820
Otherwise, even Jingdi couldn't easily offend him

28
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.260
If you dare to take this ledger to the Ministry of Justice to report him

29
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.780
Do you believe that the other party will destroy this evidence when they turn their eyes?

30
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.580
Then go to Sun Li to take credit

31
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.580
That's politics.

32
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.860
Also popular

33
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.680
Didn't the big brother investigate the case by decree?

34
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.260
We can present it to the Emperor directly through the traitor lord.

35
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.460
Hey no

36
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.980
Just an old story from more than a decade ago

37
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.780
Even if His Majesty attacks

38
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.740
It's also difficult to get damage. How about a gift?

39
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.220
At that time, a large number of North Korean and Chinese officials will try to ensure

40
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.500
In the end, it would be good to demote Tafalu

41
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.740
The big deal is that some painless results are

42
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.540
Maybe I have a way
