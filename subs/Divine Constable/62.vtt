00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.980
Father and uncle

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.100
What is it like to be noisy?

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.260
No matter how noisy you are, get me out

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.760
Okay ma'am, don't be angry

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.180
Xiaofeng and the others also want to see me

6
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.340
You go out first

7
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.300
Just get used to them

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.800
moon

9
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.980
Dad, how are you now?

10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.720
Uncle Qian, you are here too

11
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.900
So many years

12
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.960
Make you feel wronged

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.420
I don't feel wronged, I know Uncle Qian is for my own good

14
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.460
Don't worry.

15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.380
The doctor said I was fine

16
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.180
I'm just a little weak

17
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.540
Worried you

18
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.100
Uncle is fine

19
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.580
That way we can rest assured.

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.900
Satsuki told me all about you

21
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.740
Uncle, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.820
Get you involved

23
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.500
You were appointed by the Sun family

24
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.260
If the second uncle says this, he will see the outside world.

25
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.480
I am also a Qin family

26
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.060
Your business is my business

27
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.320
Besides, we don't have a choice

28
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.220
Okay?

29
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.500
Yeah, no choice.

30
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.600
Dad, tell us what's going on

31
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.820
Is there anything missing from my brother's refund?

32
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.660
In fact, the truth

33
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.660
It's almost the same as what Xiaofeng pushed in.

34
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.220
From this point on

35
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560
Xiaofeng is really amazing

36
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.420
From a trap box to get this far

37
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.380
Beyond my expectations

38
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.640
It's all luck

39
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.620
Luck is also part of ability

40
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.980
But

41
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.820
You got one thing wrong.
