1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.060
These bastards are clearly framing big brother

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.280
Sister-in-law, what should we do now?

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.260
You can't just watch your big brother wait to die like this

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.940
No, I'm going back to move the rescuers and stop

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.280
Who do you think in the capital now would risk being angered by the Sun family to help them?

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.300
What to do then?

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.340
You can't just watch big brother being played to death by the Sun family like this, right?

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.740
before the time

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.340
Only believe him

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.820
My eldest brother

11
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.540
This is what he put in my hand before he was taken

12
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.060
within the plan

13
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.440
Don't worry.

14
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.940
How is this possible?

15
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.200
Don't look at your big brother's usual giggling

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.660
A cynical look

17
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.700
But in fact, he was more afraid of death than anyone else

18
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.940
Fear of death

19
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.740
It is because he is afraid of death

20
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760
So he thinks more than anyone else

21
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.860
Also more cautious

22
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.340
It's just that I can't think of any descendants he left behind

23
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.020
Go where

24
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.860
County
