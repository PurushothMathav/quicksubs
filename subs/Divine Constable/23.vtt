00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.540
I brought you the porridge cooked in my aunt's kitchen

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.980
Thank you

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.600
Thank you

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.520
If it weren't for you and Yueer

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.360
I'm afraid this family has long since broken up

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.880
Auntie, what are you talking about?

7
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.700
This is what I should do.

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.560
I saw that bowl of porridge was cold just now.

9
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.860
So I had the kitchen reheat another bowl.

10
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.220
You can feed it to uncle, thank you.

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.100
Can't feed, husband

12
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.420
This porridge is not drinkable

13
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.140
Why can't you drink this porridge? It's poisonous.

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.580
What empress

15
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.720
What the hell is going on?

16
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.300
You have to ask him about it.

17
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.000
Husband, what do you mean by that?

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.740
Are you still playing dumb with me?

19
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.280
You are the descendant of the Chu family in Hedong, who was led by my second uncle to kill the family.

20
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.160
Chu Chu Chu Han

21
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.320
Am I right?

22
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.660
Hedong Chu's
