00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.100
Help! Help!

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.120
Help!

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.440
Ah!

4
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.180
Jin Feng, you are an adult

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.660
well known

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.440
The smoke from the fire was hot and dry

7
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.240
If you inhale a large amount before death

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.100
It must leave a mark in the throat

9
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.620
That is to say

10
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.240
The two men did not die in the fire

11
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.940
He died before the fire started.

12
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.520
What? And according to the dossier

13
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.600
My second uncle Qin Yuantu stole property

14
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.860
Let the tiger go

15
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.580
Household servant Zhang Ji and his eldest son

16
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.340
He died in the sea of fire

17
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.100
What if Zhang Jizeren died before the fire?

18
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.720
Adults even so

19
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.740
Then the picture with your own eyes can't wash away the salted fish.

20
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.600
After he parted ways with my father

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.880
In a hurry, I went to set a fire

22
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.040
Maybe he killed someone first

23
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.180
The fire is just to drown the evidence, my lord, to destroy the evidence

24
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.520
Mr. Zhang, let me ask you another question. What question?

25
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.320
Since it was my second uncle who killed your father and then set it on fire

26
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.180
Then how did your brother die?

27
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.160
There's no smoke in your brother's throat

28
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.000
Which means it wasn't a fire either

29
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.400
And according to the authentic

30
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.360
After my second uncle came to Zhang Mansion

31
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.520
Stayed in the room of the deceased

32
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.960
After the second uncle leaves

33
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.400
That's when the fire started

34
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.180
This was just confirmed with Lord Fu Yin

35
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.840
That's right, then I'll ask you again

36
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.340
Who killed your brother?
