00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.620
Wow

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.460
Is this ancient times?

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.540
And beautiful women

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.360
Oh, no.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.420
Have to be steady

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.740
Humph trash

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.840
Who are you so incompetent?

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.260
Didn't your father teach you to be polite?

9
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.920
I am the son of Lang Zhangji in the Ministry of Household

10
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.620
So your father is dead

11
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.700
No wonder. Is that okay?

12
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.700
Sujing

13
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.260
This is the courthouse

14
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.380
Who dares to speak wildly here

15
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.100
Pulled out to fight the second division

16
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.540
The police just said that you already know the truth of the case

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.840
I mean it.

18
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.820
Naturally serious

19
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.300
That official will give you a chance to tell the truth

20
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.020
If it expires

21
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.220
That officer will chop off your head immediately

22
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.620
I dare not, but before Lord Zhou solves the case

23
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.740
Caomin has a few things I want to confirm with you.

24
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.400
According to the dossier

25
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
My second uncle has never left the deceased Fang Xian since he came to Zhang's mansion

26
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.680
After my uncle leaves

27
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.700
That's when the fire started

28
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.600
And accidentally burned Zhang Jiazi, who lived in the next yard

29
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.880
Yeah, it's good.

30
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.500
Then why is everyone so sure that this fire must have been set by my second uncle?

31
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.260
No, have you ever read Volume Master Network?

32
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.760
The government decided that your second uncle was the murderer, not because he started a fire after he left

33
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.640
But someone saw him set the fire with their own eyes. Who?

34
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.660
Why can't you?

35
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.800
Are you the only one who saw it or someone else around you saw it too?

36
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.280
Why am I alone?

37
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.240
And how important is that?

38
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.080
Not important

39
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.860
It's incredibly important.

40
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.860
What did this Qin Feng hit?

41
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.180
Do you have any questions?

42
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.180
No, who is the murderer?
