00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.720
But I still advise you to take it easy

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.840
Otherwise, it's not just a simple matter like the demise of the Qin family

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.100
Don't tighten your fists

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.560
It's definitely us who will suffer now

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.580
What to do then?

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.980
procrastination

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.460
From the looks of Sun Quan, he shouldn't know about us yet. As long as he can drag the people from the Criminal Department to come, it will be fine.

8
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.740
Why don't you give up?

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.580
I also hope that His Majesty can help

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.660
You're just pissed off

11
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.620
Stop being delusional

12
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.240
Sun Qian, what are you doing here today?

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.500
Hahaha, what are you doing here?

14
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.300
Of course to kill you

15
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.940
So blatant

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.520
Aren't you afraid of national laws?

17
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.760
I originally wanted to stabilize it for you.

18
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.080
But then I thought about it.

19
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.100
Too lazy to toss

20
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.700
It's better to kill you

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.300
Besides, our Sun family is very concerned about condemning the dead

22
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.780
Still do it

23
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.380
Blame your Qin family

24
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.840
It's not good to offend anyone

25
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.300
You must offend our Sun family

26
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.580
court death

27
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.900
Besides, of course the law of the country works for you untouchables

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.220
It's just a decoration for us

29
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.900
This is the situation now

30
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.660
You can't blame me.

31
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.180
Blame it on your bad life

32
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.740
Wrong tire

33
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.060
Somebody take it for me
