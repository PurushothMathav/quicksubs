00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.500
Ooh, cool.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.860
Oh, thank you Brother Zhou for the treat today.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.040
Otherwise, this place really can't afford it.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.860
That

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.960
It's getting late

6
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.400
Or I'll send someone to deliver it

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.920
Qin Gongzi replied, no need, no need

8
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.020
I'll go slowly by myself and digest it first

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.100
Brother Da Qin, walk slowly, let's go

10
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.860
It's not safe for me to lean back

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.680
Oops, never mind

12
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm on orders

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.780
I don't believe anyone dares to touch me

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.940
Master, go back to the mansion

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.620
This man is not simple

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.220
Forget it, go back first

17
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.240
OK

18
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.600
What's wrong with me, bro, what are you doing in my room?

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.900
I have something to tell you.

20
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.380
I was followed today.

21
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.040
How come?

22
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.480
Do you know who the other party is?

23
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.400
Well it's not just me

24
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.080
Senior sister and little sister also feel this way

25
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.040
I just went to the roof to check it out

26
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.260
We found some grass nearby moving as well.

27
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.900
We are likely to be watched.

28
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.100
The people of the Sun family are not

29
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.480
It could also be His Majesty's people

30
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.320
People who investigate and respond to the case have accidents one after another

31
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.840
It is impossible for His Majesty not to send someone to protect this big brother. Where have you been?

32
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.400
Why are you back so late?

33
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.540
I'm going to cut uh

34
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.800
Ask someone to turn it on and go to Guanhe, it took a while

35
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.860
You turned it on. Shh.

36
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.820
Be quiet and be happy

37
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740
