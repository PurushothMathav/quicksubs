00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.660
Pardon me?

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.780
Uncle Qin put the collected evidence in the secret room of the Chu family

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.560
That's right, did you find it?

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.920
I originally thought that the thing left by my second uncle was a book that recorded the past of the Chu family

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.180
I wanted to use the past to bring down the Sun family

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.660
I think it's useless now

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.720
Maybe it's fate, but we've almost searched the back room

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.160
Other than this, I didn't find anything else suspicious

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.520
Could it be that you missed something? Impossible

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.040
We checked carefully

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.340
Big brother jumpsuit

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.140
Men misunderstand

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.200
It's all nonsense from the end of Qin

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.220
How could someone as honest as me do such a perverted thing?

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.220
If the clue left by the uncle is not this book

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.020
What is that?

17
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.460
Is it that one?

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.840
Now what?

19
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.740
Are we going to go back and look for it again?

20
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.440
No, I suspect all the clues in the secret room have been taken

21
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.220
How is it possible to take it away?

22
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.540
I found this book moved next to it in the secret room

23
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.980
Although I don't know who it is, it is obviously before our Jiezi

24
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.540
Doesn't that mean the clues are all gone?

25
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.740
I've got a plan.

26
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.680
How?

27
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.720
Go through the previous investigation of the second uncle again

28
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560
For example, who has he met these days?

29
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.860
Where have you been?

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.700
If he can find evidence to turn to the Sun family

31
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.480
There's no reason we can't find a good way

32
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.460
Just do it.
