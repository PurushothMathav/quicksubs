00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.440
Brother Qin

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.340
Don't be so pessimistic?

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.520
You and I are brothers after all

4
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.240
I wanted to kill you. You'd be dead already

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.860
I won't live to be now

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.720
Then what are you doing here?

7
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.340
Are you here to see my jokes?

8
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.260
I came here because

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.260
I think Brother Qin is a talent

10
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.980
It's a pity to die like this

11
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.180
Why don't you follow me and work under me

12
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.060
How about I guarantee you a lifetime of glory?

13
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.540
Sir, shut up

14
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.660
It's nonsense

15
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.280
You just called me an ant and a citizen

16
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.760
I thought you were awesome

17
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.140
It turns out that you are just a dog, bastard

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.100
What's my proposal?

19
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.100
Not great.

20
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.980
It seems that Brother Qin still does not understand the situation

21
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.240
Brother Sun, I am in very good health.

22
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.440
It's just that the waist is not very good

23
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.540
Can't bend

24
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.180
Why don't you come and rub it for me?

25
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.940
You pariah

26
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.180
Shut up yeah

27
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.680
So be it.

28
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.780
Since you insist on courting death

29
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.500
Lord Wu, take the things

30
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.020
This is the Lord, of course

31
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.820
Your murder stick

32
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.260
Brother Sun is trying to force tribute by words and deeds

33
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.160
I told you so.

34
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.660
You have no choice.

35
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.660
What if I don't sign?
