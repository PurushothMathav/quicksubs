00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.980
Student Sun Qian

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.960
No teacher

3
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.120
I don't know the number of courtesies to frame the teacher and expel the millet sword from today

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.540
Cannot be hired forever

5
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.840
If you dare to do this, I will make it clear to the saint and the traitor

6
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.500
Come and stay with me

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.220
Please let me wait.

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.360
I won't let you go.

9
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.460
Now you and the Sun family are completely torn apart

10
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.760
It's gone forever.

11
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.860
What's the difference?

12
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.960
Besides, isn't that what the Emperor wants to see?

13
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.360
It seems that you understand His Majesty's intentions very well

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.240
Of course, I know that when it comes to knives, there is a difference between knives

15
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.400
Good as long as you work hard

16
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.060
Your Majesty will not treat you unfairly

17
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.700
As for the Sun family

18
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.460
His Majesty specifically explained

19
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.740
The Sun family is behind the foundation of Chaozhong

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.100
If you tear your face

21
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.060
It is easy to cause turmoil in the court

22
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.340
So His Majesty won't help you.

23
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.020
Everything is up to you.

24
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.640
If you can move to this big tree in Sun's house

25
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.980
Your Majesty will understand from now on

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.980
This officer is also very optimistic about you.

27
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.320
It's getting late.

28
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.020
I should also go back to the palace to report

29
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.140
Take care.

30
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.540
Welcome sir

31
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.140
Hey, I can't believe it took so much effort to move to Sun's house

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180
Looks like I need to take the initiative
