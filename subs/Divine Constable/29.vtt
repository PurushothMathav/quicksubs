00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.060
Unexpected

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.240
The flowers in the previous life lasted for decades

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.000
I am known as the Little Prince of Jianghu Nightclub

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.500
One day I will be defeated by a woman

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.300
Hey, is this what old people often say about retribution?

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.560
Hey

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.300
Big brother, get in

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.460
Tell me what's the matter with me

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.360
Didn't you ask me to investigate my father's whereabouts before the accident?

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.620
I found out.

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.100
My father did meet someone before the accident

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.300
And I've only seen this one person

13
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.340
It's just that this person's identity is a bit big

14
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.840
supervisor

15
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.820
My teacher Guo Zijian confirmed Zhao Shouren

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.860
Hmph, it turned out to be him

17
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.360
Ah shit is the second grade

18
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.040
My second uncle is too awesome

19
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.600
Even if a ninth-grade sesame official knows a fourth-grade Zhang Ji

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.080
Even the traitor knows

21
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.820
My second uncle shouldn't be a hermit boss, right?

22
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.900
Uh second brother

23
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.080
I remember you were also a student of political abuse, right?

24
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.460
How is your relationship?

25
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.780
Brother, are you kidding me?

26
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.460
We Guo Ziqian are all students who witness adults

27
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.420
You want to say the instrument of mentorship and apprenticeship

28
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.100
I don't have the qualifications to cut

29
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.040
What about others?

30
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.020
How are the people?

31
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.420
I don't know very well.

32
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.420
However, the other party has always given people a very kind image

33
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.020
And very modest.

34
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.300
Hmm big brother

35
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.540
Do you want to see the witness in person?

36
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.860
You can do it.

37
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.620
I can't do it.

38
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.500
But I know someone who can do it.

39
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.840
Who?

40
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.260
he

41
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.480
