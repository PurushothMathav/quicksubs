00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.660
Chen Han, I'll give you one more chance

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.100
Tell me all the secrets you know about the Sun family

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.020
I can beg His Majesty to spare you from death

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.100
Breeze

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.740
You underestimate me.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.540
Breeze Me

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.660
I swear I will never be your enemy again

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.580
You got it.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.280
Don't move.

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700
Don't worry, I'll let him speak

11
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.340
Take them away from me

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.420
Go

13
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.800
Don't worry ahead

14
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.620
Sooner or later you will all come down to accompany me

15
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.380
Hahahaha

16
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.760
General Hui, everyone has committed suicide

17
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.340
This is tough

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.580
That's okay.

19
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.440
As long as it can be proved that Chenghai was assassinated

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.860
Anyway, I didn't expect this piece of evidence to move to the Sun family

21
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
It seems that you have your own plans. Sort of

22
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.500
Brother, where have you been?

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's okay, it's quite troublesome.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.780
By the way, why haven't you gone back yet? It's not to wait for you.

25
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.300
Oh, by the way, Miss Hongxiu just sent someone to give you this letter, saying that it says what you want.

26
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.580
Brother, what is written on it?

27
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.580
I want to go home
