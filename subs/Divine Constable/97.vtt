00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.460
Mr. Sun, why are you here?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.140
Lord, I came here today to take my son away

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.100
Hahaha joke

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.340
Suspected of kidnapping for ransom and setting up a private court

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.340
Maybe you can take it away if you want

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.100
You're taking me too seriously

7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.940
If I say it means Concubine De

8
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.340
Concubine De can't blatantly violate the laws of the country

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.260
You can't tell me that

10
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.920
Why don't you tell Concubine De yourself?

11
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.820
And you said my son was a suspect

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.260
You have proof?

13
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.080
Ah!

14
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.180
This little friend

15
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.900
This private court thing

16
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.300
I think it's a misunderstanding

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.020
What do you think?

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.260
Infinite others is a verb

19
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.980
You think about it

20
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.140
Otherwise, will your family encounter any accidents when they go out in the future?

21
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.860
I can't guarantee it.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.800
How dare you threaten me?

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.860
Not a threat

24
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.260
I'm just reminding you to speak well

25
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.780
Chemoziwu

26
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.020
Enough Sun Li

27
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.600
This is the Criminal Department

28
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.060
Not your household department

29
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.540
If you dare to speak wildly in court again

30
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.180
Don't blame this officer for severely punishing you.

31
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.140
Are you scaring me?

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.700
Is this official afraid of you?

33
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.140
Lord Sun, what a great official prestige you are!

34
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.660
Lord Kim Jong Un
