00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.040
Doctor, how is my second uncle?

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.360
Lord Qin is a very rare giant

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.520
The palace has tried its best

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.420
As for when he wakes up

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.220
Damn it, don't let me know who he is

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.140
Otherwise, I won't let him go.

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.660
How deep is the darkness involved?

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.360
Zhang Ji is a second-rank official

9
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.840
As a result, Zhang Xia all died

10
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.520
Now it's my Qin family's turn

11
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.060
I just received the decree

12
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.120
How is the second minister?

13
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.420
Taking care of my dad

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.180
Big brother, what happened?

15
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.940
Why was my father poisoned?

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.080
Could this be Zhang Qiang?

17
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.880
Will not

18
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.360
Just got the news.

19
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.520
Zhang Zhijie has died tragically in prison

20
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.020
What Zhang Zhijie died

21
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.080
How is that possible?

22
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.780
People involved in sex tax prostitution cases don't end well

23
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.980
It's better not to let them know at this time.

24
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.540
I remember something

25
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360
This was left to me by my father when he was caught

26
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.740
What else did the second uncle say?

27
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.980
organ box

28
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.380
Could it be that Dad's preview is related to this thing?

29
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.480
Maybe, but how do I open this?

30
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.020
Hey don't look at me

31
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.840
I am a reader

32
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.980
Won't unlock

33
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.460
Could it be that this matter is related to the clues left by the second uncle's investigation of the tax and bank case?

34
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.500
This is obviously a hot potato

35
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.340
The other party may also be here for this

36
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.000
What do you mean, big brother?

37
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.860
I'll give you this box.
