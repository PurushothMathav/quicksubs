00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.240
Call

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.580
Just cross

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.020
What's the matter with crossing into a cell?

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.740
God, aren't you playing with me?

5
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.260
Oh, poor me, old and young

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.820
I'm still a good young man

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.460
No way.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.260
I can't sit still

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.220
I have to find a way to save myself

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.200
Jizhou

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700
Yuan Shen's second uncle is upright

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.300
Never arson

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.340
As long as the culprit behind the scenes can be found

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.380
Solve the case

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.380
Everything is solved

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.820
But

17
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.540
I am in this place

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.220
How can I find the murderer?

19
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.940
By the way, if memory serves

20
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.380
dossier

21
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.580
According to historical records

22
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.760
The file records the whole case solid wood

23
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.140
As long as I can find the dossier

24
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.380
It's all over

25
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.660
Ah, that's right.

26
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.980
big brother

27
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.480
Your Majesty has Ling Taidao, the offender is suspected of arson, murder, and murder. The officials took down all the people in the love house

28
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.380
Jail

29
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.240
No, my Qin family has been loyal for generations

30
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.340
It must be slander

31
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.240
It's slander.

32
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.220
I have reported that it is a dog.

33
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.800
Stop talking to me

34
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600
shut up

35
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.320
Second brother take away

36
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.780
Second brother, express delivery in the army

37
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.920
Qin Mo, why are you here?

38
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.100
I was right

39
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.400
Why aren't you locked up?

40
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.640
I am the head of the country

41
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.900
Exemption from criminal law

42
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.700
However, the citizens of Baghdad will never be allowed to be officials

43
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.300
Why can't scholars be exempted from criminal law?

44
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.980
Isn't that differential treatment?

45
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.220
What are you talking about?

46
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.380
No, I mean, oh, right.

47
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.660
Do me a favor

48
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.980
What are you busy with? I want to see Junzong
