00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.620
Back then, Sun Jia framed things

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.400
Selling weapons to the grasslands without permission

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.820
But the seller is not doing things, but the Sun family.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.580
It just so happened that the Sun family accountant recorded the transaction

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.420
You still have the ledger?

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.360
Sun Jia originally planned to kill him

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.060
But the other party escaped this disaster because of his luck

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.180
And also brought out the ledger

9
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.100
Later, the second uncle found this clue

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.160
And find each other

11
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.760
But the other party refused to come back and identify him because he was afraid of the power of the Sun family

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.780
So the second uncle brought the ledger back

13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.480
If I'm not mistaken

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.560
The ledger is in the dry well chamber

15
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.040
The reason why we didn't find it

16
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.820
It was because it was taken by the Sun family.

17
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.100
Now what?

18
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.960
Don't worry, I've found a new way, are you trying to find this person?

19
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.820
Let him personally refer to the Eun Sun family

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.620
That's right, and I've already got his address from the traitor

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.100
Really, but this needs to be well planned
