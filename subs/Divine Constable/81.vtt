00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.640
Sir, please drink tea

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.700
Thank you girl

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.540
The little girl met the young master for a moment

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.740
I don't know the full name of the son either.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.820
Qin Feng Qin Feng

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.580
Could it be that you are the doctor of law from the school motto Sun Qian?

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.780
Exactly below

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.040
Forgive the little girl's clumsy eyes

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.040
I didn't recognize the son.

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.700
Thank you so much, sir.

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.400
Why thank me

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.340
If it wasn't for the son teaching Sun Qian a lesson

13
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.180
I'm afraid this person will haunt me again

14
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.980
Thank you for writing this poem for Hong Xiu

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.840
As soon as this poem comes out

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.820
I'm afraid that Hongxiu will become famous all over the world

17
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.320
Poetry doesn't matter

18
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.560
Mainly because I am curious about what this Sun Qian is doing

19
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.140
The girl is so disgusted

20
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.980
This person is ridiculous and lustful

21
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.140
malevolent

22
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.720
This girl doesn't like it

23
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.980
Compared to the son

24
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.660
That's a big difference.

25
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.000
The girl has a great idea

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.720
But where did this lustful absurdity come from?

27
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.480
This Sun Qian was born into a famous family

28
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.400
It is normal to ask for flowers and willows

29
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.500
Could it be that the son did not come for Hongxiu this time?

30
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.040
But don't mean anything else?

31
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.860
What a coincidence

32
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.860
Just happen

33
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.700
It's about an official secret

34
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.400
Does Mr. Qin want to know?

35
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.780
Oh, of course.

36
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.020
It's not impossible to want to know

37
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.220
only

38
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.620
The son needs to pay a price

39
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.020
Red Sleeve Girl

40
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.540
Ah, forward.
