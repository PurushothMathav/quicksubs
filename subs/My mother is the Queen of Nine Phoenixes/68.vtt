00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.610
Where is my God?

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.200
What's wrong? Do you have no money?

3
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.130
Not bad. It’s not as much as No. 4.

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.180
One hundred, one trillion, one hundred million

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.110
What are you talking about? Did your eyes see that right?

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.360
That's right, Sizhen. It's the first time I've spent so much money.

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:32.310
Why don’t you believe it? Brother, who? I really don’t believe it.

8
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.910
No, he said he could bear 100 million if he came here

9
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.570
Impossible

10
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.810
Really what's going on

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.890
Excuse me

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.780
This industry

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.120
It's just my change

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.500
Do you know what change is?

15
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.580
It's just the money I spent playing

16
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.200
Hey hey hey hey

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.140
A bad recruiter

18
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.100
How much money

19
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.340
if i tell you

20
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.420
I was originally a super rich second generation

21
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.300
It’s just Yan Jun

22
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.800
Others’ kindness and sincerity towards me

23
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.350
So I pretended to be poor and went to inspect the trash and only had money left.

24
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.730
Are you pretending to be poor to recruit a bad talent like yours?

25
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.350
It’s because you’ve watched too many movies, right?

26
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.830
Just pretend like this

27
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.570
Look, this looks bigger

28
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.050
Still pretending to be mature

29
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.290
So don't worry

30
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.270
Don’t you still have money?

31
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.350
The caller has been searching for you for a long time.

32
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.330
You buy one too

33
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.670
Three hundred thousand like me

34
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.130
let me see
