00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.610
How about it? You should agree to cooperate with me this time, right?

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.900
Where does this bank opening come from?

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.500
Is there a password on the bank entrance?

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.000
And the solid group is still ours?

5
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.820
No matter what, you don't want me to believe it,

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.590
A ragged hand can take out one!

7
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.210
No, don’t play!

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.380
Promise me to cooperate is the background,

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.210
I can't help me!

10
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.710
How about I move back into yours?

11
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.230
Not to mention the unknown origin of this idea!

12
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.300
Even if it’s really yours!

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.040
In my eyes, the difficulty is in Linjia’s eyes!

14
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.540
Count it, don’t you know?

15
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.640
It's hard for me to keep my fortune

16
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.570
Song Jun, did you get your money illegally?

17
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.690
If you don't believe it

18
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.900
You can call Natural Guan and check it out.

19
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.060
There's nothing I can do

20
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.120
Where did you get so much money?

21
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.650
My mother gave it to him

22
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.000
Mom, your mother wasn’t there when you were little

23
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.490
Didn't he disappear when he ran away from home?

24
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.320
He came back later

25
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.630
And he is somewhat capable now

26
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.540
A woman who caress about her temper

27
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.209
How can I be patient?

28
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.750
My mother is somewhat related now

29
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.690
It's difficult for people, but it's expensive. Now you have to listen to him.

30
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.630
Difficulty is expensive but it’s nothing

31
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.210
One word can make the whole hurt expensive.

32
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.610
It's a big deal if you give me face because of the difficulty, kid

33
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.500
But before you can take out a leaf and try

34
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.200
Regardless of how this one came

35
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.480
You finally have something you can do

36
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.340
I will let you go today.
