00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.670
What? A play. What? No?

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.970
OK OK OK OK

3
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.830
Are you making a noise?

4
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.830
It finally came true accidentally

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.880
You are ready now

6
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.960
predicament

7
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.400
Just write the rest right away

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.720
Send it to my office immediately

9
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.180
OK OK OK OK OK

10
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.360
Right, OK, OK

11
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.920
May I ask if you are married or not?

12
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.090
You haven't yet. What's wrong?

13
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.980
Let me introduce it to you

14
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.480
This little woman is sensible

15
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.900
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.540
Little women don't get along

17
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.780
I don't know if it will be okay

18
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.560
How about untying the two of them?

19
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.550
Dad, what did you say?

20
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.790
Then I'll follow him

21
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.700
What's wrong with this place?

22
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.570
What does destiny mean about talents?

23
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.750
You are not good at acting

24
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.970
Those who beat me to death donâ€™t look at it

25
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.980
Are you serious police?

26
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250
I had my eyes opened and I told the headquarters.

27
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.220
They are willing, yes I am.
