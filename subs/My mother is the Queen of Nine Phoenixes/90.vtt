00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Are you a real diva or are you pretending to be a diva?

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.200
If you think I'm lying

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.040
Can I still be so calm now?

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.600
I think too

5
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.070
You should be real but

6
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.410
But what?

7
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.470
In fact, what kind of queen is that?

8
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.860
What is the name of the red covenant?

9
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.000
How did you do this?

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.340
But it’s a long story

11
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.560
When we have time in the future, we will tell you slowly. You tell me.

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.920
You want to charge my governor

13
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.280
How come I got to catch the ball myself?

14
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.590
I've already done the math for you too

15
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.670
Less than half a morning

16
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.680
Your Wushan risking the ball will bring back the Buddha’s heart.

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.420
Others let him pay

18
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.540
Just see him off

19
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.220
I can only ask them if they are not in a hurry.

20
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.370
I've already sent someone

21
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.700
Don't make any noise

22
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.780
What does it have to do with

23
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.840
Difference in work

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.020
Because of your quarrel

25
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.260
It doesn't matter to you

26
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.480
Fortunately, I'm not alone.

27
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.610
Who did you have a child with? I am now

28
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.750
Give you a chance without permission

29
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.330
You gave yourself an explanation

30
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.660
How about your immigration?
