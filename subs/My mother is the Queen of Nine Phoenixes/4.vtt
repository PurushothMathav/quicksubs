00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.900
I can't catch more than three thousand a month.

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.850
Isn't this a coincidence?

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.550
Ma! Relatively common, right?

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.900
Brother, I really have no money.

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.460
I collect it and earn dozens in a day.

6
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.900
There is also food and rent.

7
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.360
How can I pay for a job without money?

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.740
I don't care how much money you have.

9
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.000
Just give it to you.

10
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.330
Mom, there is a saying: remember to drive the car every day!

11
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.100
Use! This is a small iron ticket. Who are you?

12
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.390
Okay, no guest, such a wife. Sorry, Tian'e.

13
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.420
How could you, a promiscuous person, find such a beautiful girlfriend?

14
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.880
I just like collecting rags. What's wrong? Is there a way?

15
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.870
It's not like you don't have money, right?

16
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.250
get your girlfriend

17
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.540
Sleep with me

18
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.660
One hundred at a time and three thousand a month are not enough.

19
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.630
I'll follow suit and get married.

20
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.070
Wife, you have no money to marry her

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.490
Nothing, no house

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.760
You take her home as your wife

23
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.840
You should lie to you

24
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.599
she can't afford it

25
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.980
What else do you want to do? Let me tell you.

26
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.660
give it to me

27
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.610
What do you think of your good cousin?

28
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.220
Don't go crazy, I'll wash the food

29
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.890
I'll mention it to you

30
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.270
Do you still want to treat me urgently?

31
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.880
That would kill me

32
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.710
Why don't you cut the water today?
