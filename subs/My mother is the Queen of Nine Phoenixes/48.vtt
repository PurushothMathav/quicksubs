00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.200
Xiaojun, take this,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.280
This kind of difficulty is like having a long and deep understanding of love,

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.780
Let him give it to you.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.360
If you write something like this, I will go to Yinha Air Show to get an idea.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.760
You want to see me come over and squat for a while.

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.480
If you like to fight, then don't let me go.

7
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.020
Okay, I'll just give it a try.

8
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.220
Listen to me, take this thing,

9
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.900
Old age and want to have the same idea, it is not the next movie.

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.240
Don't worry, no matter what, you can't solve the case hierarchically.

11
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.830
Wow, if I could write something like this,

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.910
But when he comes to squat and beat him, you will never pay attention to him again.

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.460
You are the one who collects the mess

14
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.900
It only costs a few thousand yuan a month.

15
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.430
Since you have something to say

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.500
I want to ask my daughter about it

17
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.640
I will work hard

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.360
Sooner or later I will be unemployed

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
stand out

20
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.250
Give Ruoxue happiness

21
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.540
Bye bye day visitors

22
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.970
Many people come from

23
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.740
His fate will be determined

24
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.740
You took out one million in an ordinary way

25
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.470
Can I buy a gunhouse on my own?

26
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.440
I will also look up to you

27
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.280
Give me this ability

28
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.820
If you really have the same intention

29
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.270
You can just go to Deputy Suzute's house and find him. What are you doing, Zansaku?
