00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.360
He immediately let go of his wife. Haha

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.360
I'll chop you into eight pieces

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.940
Old man, you have to know that the person you offended today is Fei Kuzhao.

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.900
For example, how do you get non-weapons? This three-day boss

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.880
You can’t even play with your wife. I’ll let you play with your wife.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.440
The boss is coming. The boss is coming.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.700
Hall buddy

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.280
Go here today

9
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.960
Are you still able to leave?

10
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.960
Dude, I'm upstairs, brother, come down

11
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.120
Look at our building and you will die, you old guy.

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.040
The boss looked at you today

13
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.240
Ahhhh, Brother Wang

14
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.600
It’s so old to make trouble with a car

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000
Ganny's stuck knife

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.260
Bro the news

17
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.260
How come Hongshan will die and cause trouble?

18
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.520
I must let him lie down and go back.

19
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.350
You're playing to death, don't let go

20
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.990
I will take care of you

21
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.850
You take you and get used to it

22
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.800
I'm not afraid of anything happening if I hold that

23
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.200
Why don't you tell me that you are talking nonsense with these kings?

24
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.020
I shouldn't fight with you

25
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.300
Come and take you out for a while

26
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.569
Take this a little longer

27
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.150
After today

28
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.680
I'll let you be the leading old man

29
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.490
You're the only one still bragging here.

30
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.390
Is it because you, a picture-taught thing, can make plans without planning and get stuck just by doing it?
