00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.390
Is Success here?

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.600
Captain No. 6, you are here

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.900
Chenggongzi, what new projects have you recently met?

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.180
Need to mobilize funds?

5
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.340
Nothing?

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.040
It's just a slap in the face of an old Xiang Fang who is responsible for maintaining the world.

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.500
What kind of person is old?

8
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.040
Chase for success

9
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.280
Are you looking for death?

10
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.840
What's wrong?

11
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.600
No trumpet leader is coming

12
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.660
Were you beaten for acting?

13
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.570
Is there a trumpet leader? What?

14
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.610
That means you need to mobilize funds

15
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.820
Do you want him to press my face?

16
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.330
Boss Hong, why are you here?

17
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.870
Liu Zhong, can’t you see me?

18
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.890
Captain No. 6, what are you doing?

19
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.970
You are the President of the World Bank

20
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.620
So why lose a sachet and get old as a reward?

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.240
Do you know my true strength?

22
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.780
Only dare to step on small feet

23
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.200
It’s really not locked

24
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.760
are you kidding me

25
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.760
My family has never passed anyone like this.

26
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.450
You said he is better than me

27
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.160
Just support me

28
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.110
The current trend of live financial trading

29
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.580
Put it this way

30
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.900
You won't help him

31
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.740
Only then can I be reasonable
