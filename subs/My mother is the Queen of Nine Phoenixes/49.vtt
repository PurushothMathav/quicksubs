00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.410
Stop, what are you following? I'm looking for Emperor Dong

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.850
What are you doing with Emperor Dong?

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.109
Find some money to save you

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.290
Still want to ask Dong Huang for money?

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.580
Are you a wind person?

6
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.700
What is the identity of Emperor Dong?

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.520
Is it something you can see casually?

8
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.720
Could you please stop being so mean-spirited?

9
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.020
I just don't have time to change into something really rich.

10
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.360
But my mother has a lot of background

11
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.660
Does your mother have a background?

12
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.340
Get out of here, get out of here, get out of here!

13
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.700
Come on, what are these?

14
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.180
I don’t know where such an old person comes from?

15
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.000
Since you are asking the emperor for money, why don't you drive him out quickly?

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.660
He looked for Dong Huang’s long curved shoes

17
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.240
Is this calling a class?

18
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.520
We still won’t do the crime for you

19
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.160
In faith, you are guilty of seeking trust.

20
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.220
I don’t care if you’re full

21
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.590
I really didn't lie to you

22
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.210
My mother gave me three notes

23
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.420
Yesterday I came to look for Dong Huang's long curved shoes

24
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.540
I don’t see you guys looking at this

25
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.990
You said it's a trend, right?

26
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.570
Take such a piece of shit

27
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.510
Now that I'm in a hurry to put on my shoe,

28
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.300
I don’t know if it was her mother who became popular or she became popular.

29
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.500
It's not called shoes, right?

30
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.800
My family doesn’t know and I can’t even ask for it.
