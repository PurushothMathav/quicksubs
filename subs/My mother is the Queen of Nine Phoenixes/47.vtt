00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Okay, or something?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.380
nothing else

3
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.180
Guide the relevant people clearly

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.480
I want to talk to my husband and son about being a walking queen

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.660
I told you first

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.740
Okay, go ahead and listen to me

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.520
What are you doing?

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.010
We are so proud now

9
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.380
my identity

10
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.880
Itâ€™s not convenient to leave now

11
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.300
But don't worry

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.720
As long as you have me for one day

13
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.700
Then no one will be angry with you

14
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.600
The life you want for your money

15
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.180
I can give it to you too

16
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.040
Of course you mean it

17
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.580
Then I want 1 million

18
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.690
have you

19
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.770
What do you do with a million?

20
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.160
Don't worry about what I do

21
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.850
have you

22
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.680
Renew one million

23
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.060
Even if you want 100 million

24
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.640
I can give you 100 million

25
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.240
Then give me 100 million

26
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.720
If you can spend 100 million

27
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.980
I will forgive you and support you

28
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.270
Be very careful with our Fuzi departments.

29
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330
you take this

30
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.050
Go to the president of Difficulty Bank

31
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.610
Let him give you benefits
