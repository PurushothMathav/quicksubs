00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
If you actually call agricultural funds from the World Bank,

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.100
Then I will immediately take my son and drive from here!

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.780
Is this what you said?

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.130
Yes, that's what I said.

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.780
OK, you wait,

6
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.740
See how I fight you,

7
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.600
Let you lose it!

8
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.200
Hey, don't talk about it.

9
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.680
Have you been downstairs now?

10
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.500
I need some funds here

11
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.890
You'll want to adjust

12
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.650
Okay, I figured it out.

13
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.650
Wait for me here

14
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.320
Let me show you what power is

15
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.240
if i tell you

16
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.590
The world's No. 1 Huang Changlai is mine in the Dragon Kingdom.

17
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.740
You can still laugh

18
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.880
What did you say

19
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.310
The number one Huang Chang in the world is your name

20
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420
You have this idea

21
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.280
It seems that you are accompanying this kind of person

22
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.260
The master is on the road many times

23
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.670
It's okay for you to be far away

24
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.400
Difficulty is world-class

25
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.350
You can't take your time without overtaking me

26
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.320
But you can rest assured that you feel like a mother

27
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.400
I will give you enough face

28
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.080
Okay, thatâ€™s all you have

29
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.920
Even if it is sparse

30
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.910
I don't care anymore

31
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.970
Don't worry, it can't be mine

32
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.520
That's it, you kind

33
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.930
Once you do it, you will know the consequences

34
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.640
Is success all there?
