00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.180
You need money, right? I want you to go home! It’s hard to get it!

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.130
What? No?

3
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.320
Such a big smell? Isn’t he some kind of diva?

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.420
Farewell to me, old man!

5
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.860
Are you still in the group? Really listen, right? Are you still talking?

6
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.090
Who has this now?

7
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.670
You actually asked the captain for money directly from the announcement?

8
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.610
How could it be?

9
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.450
Captain, Captain? A Fengzi was caught here who wanted to find some change to trust his relatives?

10
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.570
Fengzi is trying to cheat me out of money? What's going on?

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.070
He brought a broken address slip? Just ask for change?

12
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.090
Come to me with a broken ruler and ask for money

13
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.250
What money do you want?

14
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.450
You all appreciate it, my mother said

15
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.410
You see the finger is transferred away

16
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.750
Just give me the money

17
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.060
It’s still so easy to adjust the name. Wait a minute.

18
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.500
Quickly take the finger reward and let it go

19
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.010
Who can give you instructions?
