00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.280
Please go and get your whole batch

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.980
Only you are dead

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.590
I'm so scared

4
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.790
I am just a suspected dog criminal like this.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.000
No, this, this, my heart is quite good, I won’t let it go

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.200
Unless you kneel now

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.460
Block me, please

8
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.520
I can consider letting you go

9
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.160
Be your mother and wear the autumn desert

10
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.920
Pay back 50 million, and you won’t even eat even 5 yuan.

11
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.080
Then why does it have to be so small?

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.850
So I took it as a gift

13
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.530
here here

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.770
here, here, here, here

15
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.150
What a tough guy to say

16
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.070
Passing through people is really the same impression

17
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.090
I doubt that he must have committed a serious crime

18
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.890
How did he go smoothly in the car?

19
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.960
You still said

20
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.410
Real personnel

21
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.230
at your house yesterday

22
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.320
The sky is where you are, I know

23
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.860
Your mother is an adult

24
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.820
I'm not conservative

25
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.190
He must have mistakenly admitted his mother.

26
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.150
He ran away with someone a long time ago

27
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.190
How can it be that you are an adult? Let me go.

28
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.250
What I mean by Qingyue

29
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.970
Don't lie

30
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.490
Slightly, slightly, not really

31
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.410
I said his classmate

32
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.870
He that day

33
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.110
I don’t understand him

34
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.440
He's still alive

35
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.860
You're still on the roof

36
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.000
If you can't stop me, I'll get out

37
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.960
I can't live with you

38
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.800
Put the money on this again
