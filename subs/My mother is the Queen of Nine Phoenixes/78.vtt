00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.800
Is it him? Yes, it's him.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.320
Old woman, you want to help your son steal from me.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.410
My son beats you to everything, why can't he fight with you?

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.510
What did you say? Your son beats me in everything.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.810
That's local.

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.170
I really want to cry because of your laughter.

7
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.760
Okay, then what did you say?

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.060
Your son, how can you compete with me?

9
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.120
For example, in studying, I am better than him than you.

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.480
He'll beat you to it.

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.480
That's a temptation

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240
Now is the time to struggle

13
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.660
He must be a mover

14
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.240
I always have a lot of these

15
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.310
So what can you criticize me about?

16
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.020
Do you think your dad is very powerful?

17
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.510
Why did he ask me to come and criticize him?

18
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.310
who do you think you are

19
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.720
My dad always has a lot of difficulties

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.740
Just like you

21
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.640
I have never eaten in my life. I went to meet my dad first.

22
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.170
Call your dad quickly

23
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.710
This difficulty is slightly different from what is recommended

24
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.030
Although they divided my business from Ling's family,

25
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.410
I want you and your wife quickly

26
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.830
I asked but didnâ€™t say anything.

27
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.820
As long as Ruoxie and I talk about attributives

28
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.750
My dad divides the center and you have 100 square cents

29
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.880
It's my business

30
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.320
Already decided to raise him

31
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.520
I've already taken you to fight with the young master, so stop fighting. Is it true?

32
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.860
Did you really agree?
