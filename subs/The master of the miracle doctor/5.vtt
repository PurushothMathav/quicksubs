00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.980
What should you do? Are you sure?

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.230
sure how

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.270
It’s just the head of the family. It’s about stopping the Dharma.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.100
You are being sent here for the first time

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.380
It’s not good that you’re not ordinary yet.

6
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.520
This family is right?

7
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.440
terribly sorry

8
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.620
I was not careful

9
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.330
Are you sure why you're out of breath?

10
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.320
I'm sure you guys will kill me.

11
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.310
You must be seriously ill

12
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.630
Before the iron incident comes again

13
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.530
It's already been confirmed that he's dead

14
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.570
Same as the one I just brushed

15
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.390
It doesn't matter

16
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.890
That's right if you say so

17
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.570
I tell you

18
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.850
That's three to five million each

19
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.729
He is not finished

20
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.670
Your brother Zhu Yuan has been here for so many days

21
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.870
Did you take care of her?

22
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.780
You don’t even pay for the treatment fee

23
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.520
Everyone is dead now

24
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.880
You still have to order money

25
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.920
Everyone has been tried by you

26
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.560
You still ask me for money

27
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.180
You stinky bitch

28
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.560
Not always promised

29
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.430
You can't run either

30
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.850
You bitch

31
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.540
You are holding back people's knowledge

32
00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.920
Return to Europe and fight with the second uncle

33
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.340
Shut everyone down

34
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.530
They beat people

35
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.690
Come here

36
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.800
You still want to save us

37
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.560
Don't cry anymore

38
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.320
What nonsense are you talking about?

39
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.690
Confirmed dead

40
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.790
How could there be any hope?

41
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.140
I am saved

42
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.100
I just showed you someone
