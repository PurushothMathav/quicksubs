00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.610
How did you do that? She was sincere.

2
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.460
If I hadn't just said that memories are not typical of drama,

3
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.520
Otherwise I really didn’t go. Fuck me,

4
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.920
Come on, come on, who are you?

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.880
It’s all about writing. Me,

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.620
I went to listen to the time being too substantial.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.860
You are the one Xiaoxi said

8
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.670
.. What's the meaning?

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.200
What do you mean? But not much,

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.820
It’s such a big name that you think you are,

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.160
Find such a good job with me.

12
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.900
No, no need to write, a bunch of Gaochang,

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.620
It's a pity, but I like to take secret photos of girls in groups,

14
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.100
Damn it, you dragging stone bodies,

15
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.090
You give me this, you give me the ground to tie up,

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.860
What to do with the monster explosion?

17
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.180
You must have no money

18
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.380
You bowed your head and survived, can you still

19
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.680
Brother, go over there

20
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.970
Who dares to have more of my brothers?

21
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.770
How do you play with people, right?

22
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.450
How are you going to do it with four?

23
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.330
Or Na Dongda, chairman of the Federation of Talking Industry Writing Conference

24
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.060
will live

25
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.260
If you think about it, you will be alive if you smash it.

26
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.200
I want to see who

27
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.980
Look at the good deeds that have done me harm again

28
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.340
What's wrong with this?

29
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.950
Three years without money

30
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.990
Someone is an old friend
