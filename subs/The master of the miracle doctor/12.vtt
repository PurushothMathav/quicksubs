00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.770
Can you help me take a look at this ratio? Here are a few songs

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.850
Ah Xing, let me take a look

3
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.410
You saw it wrong today

4
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.230
This cow is also very interesting.

5
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.470
No matter itâ€™s still Lin Xiaoxiâ€™s follow-up

6
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.710
Come and see if you are old

7
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.510
How can I go soft?

8
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.030
Call me out

9
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.870
Boss, be strong

10
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.340
With my status, can you help me eat?

11
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.540
Help me eat it

12
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.000
Give me my identity, help me, help me, help me

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.460
What's going to happen to my dad?

14
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.320
I will never let you go

15
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.210
Your dad recently had a treatment effect

16
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.230
That's right. Eat well and sleep well.

17
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.090
Which small train can pass in first?

18
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.710
So if anything happens, just try your best

19
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.090
He took your medicine today

20
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.490
You go and drink directly

21
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.230
How is it possible

22
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.460
I'll go take a look and say

23
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.520
It's tea

24
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.820
Suddenly I got this tea

25
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.920
It's a bit troublesome to think about it.

26
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.100
Will not take action

27
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.600
How many days does he sleep

28
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.320
Digested and heartbroken

29
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.220
You're talking nonsense

30
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.180
My dad had tea

31
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.980
It can be so serious

32
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.720
One is you

33
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.840
Itâ€™s time to eat, my dad

34
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.460
Get out of here
