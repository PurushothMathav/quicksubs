00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.200
Hurry up hurry up

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.800
Take all the valuables away

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.966
Master, what's wrong with you?

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.366
We're going bankrupt every time we fight

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.700
Lu Shuai said he was going to kill us all

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.466
Master, what nonsense are you talking about?

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.400
Isn't our government doing well?

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.033
How can you go bankrupt?

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.000
Not broke, right?

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.700
And don't you think I'm alive?

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.966
Your Majesty, shall we not be deceived by Chou Zhen again?

12
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.366
Deceived again, that's right

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.000
Think about it, if Lord Long Shuai really wants to kill you

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.500
I'm just like the palm of my hand.

15
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.333
Why wait until now?

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.366
But their oops

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.300
We are now

18
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.166
Isn't it just to determine Chu Chen's identity?

19
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.100
And that's not easy.

20
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.600
Chu Chen's cousin works at Feng's Group

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.333
Let's go get it and we'll know

22
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.700
Yes, they are relatives

23
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.500
It must be the root of Chu Chen

24
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.633
I see how you pretend this time

25
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.066
Su Xue, I finally came back today.

26
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.000
You and my mother

27
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Let's have a nice meal and get together

28
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.766
Okay, brother Fuqiang, then you go and prepare first.

29
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.133
Subordinates need to report

30
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.533
I just got the news.

31
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.400
Although our family is a second-rate family

32
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.900
But users in overseas cities want to take the back seat

33
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.600
That requires more strength

34
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.300
It was for Suxue's sake

35
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.066
I didn't want to kill them all

36
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:14.700
In that case

37
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.533
Then let them linger in their mouths for a few days

38
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.466
Oh yeah, one more thing.

39
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.566
Although Wang Shuai went to the king of gods and made a speech

40
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.200
But the west still looks down on me like an elephant

41
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.366
You spread the word.

42
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:28.100
Just say that this coach has set off for the border city to be stationed

43
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.633
So they wouldn't buy food. I did.

44
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.266
Sir, face me, it's fine now.

45
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.200
just right

46
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.700
Who did I think it was? Isn't this Chu Chen?

47
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.066
It's the second sister's house

48
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.500
This is your second aunt and your cousin

49
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.266
It's all a family, hurry up and sit down and eat

50
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:51.533
No, then it's embarrassing that your family has money to eat

51
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.766
Second aunt, how can you talk like that?

52
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:55.100
What's wrong with our house?

53
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.266
People don't steal or rob

54
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.933
What's wrong with making money with your own hands?

55
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:01.800
Maybe you bitch shut up for me

56
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.400
I heard people say you got along with my brother-in-law

57
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.666
Don't listen

58
00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:08.800
Are you the one who asked your sister to deal with it now?

59
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.133
Let this wimp lock it up.

60
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.200
Let's talk about forcing a lack of men

61
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.600
You don't find one you have nothing

62
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.166
Are you a wimp?

63
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.100
Look at my son

64
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.966
At a young age, this Feng family company rented it

65
00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:23.466
That's the future.

66
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.100
The landlord sister is a small family with a single wooden door
