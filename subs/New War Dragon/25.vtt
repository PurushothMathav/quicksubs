00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.766
Korean envoy 524

2
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.266
See Lord Long Shuai, the messenger of Siber, Jadomin

3
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.166
See Long Shuai

4
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.200
Who is America?

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.000
Joles sees Lord Long Shuai's ceremony

6
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.300
Thank you to the three VIPs who came to visit me not far away

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.266
I am very honored

8
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:22.700
But

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.666
I had a little argument with this guy onstage today.

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:29.200
I also hope that three VIPs can help me clarify the truth

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.400
Do you need us?

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.666
I know this person on stage

13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.100
Just a useless waste

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.000
But he is today

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.566
But dare to pretend to be a dragon in front of everyone

16
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.733
I implore three VIPs to expose his true colors

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.600
Please be innocent

18
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.800
The people here are indeed very different, Long Shuai

19
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.600
Now this was many years ago.

20
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.800
Must remember

21
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.866
The Long Shuai back then was not this young man

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.566
Hahahaha

23
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.766
Chu Chen, can you hear me?

24
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.200
Lou Shuai is not you
