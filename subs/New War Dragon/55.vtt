00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:05.466
Hmph ignorant Dorsey Dongjiao has promised us

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.900
As long as we can help him get rid of the dust

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.466
Then we will have unimaginable glory and wealth

4
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.266
Hahahaha so

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.633
Chu Chen is Long Shuai, and he will definitely come to save us. Yes

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.566
I know he is Wang Shuai.

7
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.833
But I'm going to be right about that one today

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.033
It can't be unhandsome, my lord

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.900
Can you see me?

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.633
Just this guy

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.366
Dust will come later

12
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.166
I am honest honest

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.200
Honest man honest man

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.633
Wind and wind, hurry up and tie the west sky, hahahaha.

15
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.700
What are you doing with Chu Chuan and us?

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.900
Forget it, we don't know him

17
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.600
It's your fault.

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.366
General Guo Caidong knows

19
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.600
The minister wants to revitalize the sperm of Haicheng

20
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.533
And that you guys are clever masters of various industries

21
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.533
Then I will connect you with the chief minister today

22
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.033
It will blow up in a while

23
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.000
Isn't Haicheng's economy paralyzed?

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.100
This place hahaha

25
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.266
It's cold, let's go back

26
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.166
Hello Chu Chen

27
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.966
Don't come, there are traps.

28
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:23.500
Chu Chen

29
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.300
Warehouse 13, I give you half an hour to arrive

30
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.500
Otherwise, they will all die

31
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.600
What's up?

32
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.666
Why is this?

33
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:35.966
You go home and wait for me.

34
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.633
I don't deal with some urgent matters
