00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.100
What if I remember correctly?

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.400
Someone just said

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.333
Brother Chu Cheng is really Long Shuai's words

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.500
It's not just about barking.

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.500
I also want to lick Brother Chu Cheng's shoes clean

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.533
When does it start?

7
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.900
My family is all relatives

8
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.900
My dad didn't let it go in the past

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.966
I said what the hell is this family that is short?

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.800
Those who have spoken are the same as those who have not spoken

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400
You are so shameless

12
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.633
What wait a minute

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.466
Chu felt, he is not dew at all

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.066
He is fake

15
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.900
But Long Shao didn't talk so much nonsense just now

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.633
Don't believe yourself to watch the news

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.300
The real Long Shuai has gone to Beijing

18
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.366
Sticking to the frontier

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.266
On a business trip, if you are really Long Shuai?

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.766
Why are you still here?

21
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.933
It turns out that Long Shuai went to Beiqing

22
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.733
Vinegar Chen, you are really an impostor

23
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.266
Hahaha, what do I say?

24
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.866
Vinegar, you are a waste

25
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.200
How could it be possible to become Zhi and Long Shuai's

26
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.900
Long Shuai, you are still me

27
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.200
You are talking nonsense.

28
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.466
You also saw

29
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.733
Lord Long Ying just led Zheng's American Guard

30
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.533
I personally call Chu Chen brother Long Shuai

31
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.866
How could it be fake?

32
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:05.100
Yes, Feng Shao, Lord Long Ying came in person just now

33
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.200
That's because Chu Chen once read a sentence in Beijing

34
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.566
Lord Dragon Shadow is saved

35
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.200
So

36
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.800
Lord Long Ying looked at him as a comrade-in-arms

37
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.900
Tied him up once

38
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:14.966
Exactly.

39
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.533
I was fine at home before

40
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.600
Chu Chen put down his wild talk and keep your royal business

41
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.466
But now there is no taboo in letting go of the family property

42
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.300
Ask if Chu Chen is really a marshal

43
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:28.800
Wasn't the royal family already famous by Haichen?
