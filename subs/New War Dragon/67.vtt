00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.533
How dare you take on a killer?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.900
I will be buried with your heart

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.400
Lord Long Shuai, don't be angry first

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.866
Let's be an exchanger

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.900
What exchange?

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.800
Trade your life for his

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.100
OK

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.800
I promise Lu Shuai

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.400
Ah Chu Sheng

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.066
Ask God how to kill Chu Cheng

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.333
You let me go

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.866
Miss Su, she loves you very much.

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.366
Too bad he's going to die soon

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.966
Hahahaha

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.966
You let me go

16
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.466
Chu Chen, leave me alone

17
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.466
You go fast

18
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.366
I swear nobody will hurt you

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.366
I have come

20
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.700
Thousands of agreements

21
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.800
You have to let go and go first, hahaha.

22
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.133
Wang, are you still the captain of Yu Delun?

23
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.566
To believe what I, a Westerner, said

24
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.300
What do you mean?

25
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.000
Hmph, bring it
