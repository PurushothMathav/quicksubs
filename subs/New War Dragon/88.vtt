00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.300
Zhu Chen Ge

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.866
Do you see who they are now?

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.200
This vain woman is not worthy of your love

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.866
Wake up!

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.566
Do you really want to know who loves you?

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.966
Of course, Chu Chen, I know you

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.266
That's not you.

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.533
What's up?

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.966
If we were together, he would die

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.200
What?

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.300
The more money you spend, the more money you spend, you know?

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.533
Just spoil me

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.600
Once found, a thousand arrows will pierce the heart

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.633
Only then will you be completely disappointed in me

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.833
I can save him, you understand?

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.233
Brother Jiang

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.300
Xiaoxu, I blamed you wrong

18
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.266
Brother Jiujiu, it turns out that you love me because you love me

19
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.100
Pretending to treat me like this

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.033
I should have known better

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.033
Light Snow

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.566
How can I be willing to leave you?

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.100
Light Snow Light Snow

24
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.800
Your wallet was suddenly sent by mistake.

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.000
Thanks just right

26
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.500
Anyway.

27
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.366
I will never leave you

28
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.666
You're dead at this rate.

29
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.966
Promise me that no matter what difficulties you encounter

30
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.766
We both face it together

31
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.100
Go out go out

32
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.033
Go out and take to the hospital quickly

33
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.900
We checked the patient

34
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.233
He's okay.

35
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.833
Just take a few days off.

36
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:42.800
Light Snow

37
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.800
For you and our unborn child

38
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.600
I'm really leaving

39
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:49.900
Sorry.

40
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.033
I can't keep the promise between us
