00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:05.100
If you dare a man to offend the Dragon Commander, take them all

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.000
Yes

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.300
The general is coming late

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.400
Please forgive Long Shuai

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.800
The general is coming late

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.433
Please also ask Long Shuai to suffer

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.733
You are really Captain Dragon Pig

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.066
Don't be deceived by him

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.366
This dragon shadow is fake, that's right.

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.466
We've met before.

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.566
Unbridled look at Lord Dragon Shadow, I have seen this group can be fake

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.066
How is this possible?

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.366
Suddenly, this trash turned out to be Long Shuai

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.333
Haven't I done it?

15
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.533
He is really Long Shuai

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.800
It's true, Lord Dong Yong

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.600
Zheng Beijing has not withdrawn

18
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.800
We can meet a living fairy today

19
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.900
You just hit me 80.

20
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.666
Lord Long Shuai, the villain deserves to die

21
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.766
It is said that Lord Long Shuai only needs the life of the villain

22
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.066
It's late, it's miserable now.

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.266
Come on, these royal girls

24
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.266
The military treatment of Longting Prison is

25
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.466
No, no.

26
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.000
Please save me, Lord Longyue

27
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
Lord Longyu

28
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.733
As for the explanation, the commoners do not belong to the teacher director

29
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.066
The Northern Army has no jurisdiction

30
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.500
I'll handle it myself, you go back first, as ordered

31
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.600
Second master

32
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.466
Brother Bing, of course I ran away

33
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.433
Is there anything else to do?

34
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.866
No problem.

35
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.366
You can't be untrustworthy.

36
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:14.066
As you said, if you are dumped everywhere, you will learn to bark like a dog

37
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.666
Just don't count

38
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.666
We can all testify

39
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:17.966
How about learning to bark?
