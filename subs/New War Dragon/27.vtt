00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.566
If there is a group photo, please take it out.

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.266
A group photo can prove the authenticity.

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:03.933
Uncle Shi Chen

4
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.733
Please also take out the group photo for everyone to see.

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.833
distinguish between true and false

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.366
Why is this photo only half a face?

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.500
Exactly.

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.400
Through photos

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.100
Can only see

10
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.933
Long Shuai is a very outstanding young man

11
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.100
Very sharp eyes

12
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.600
But you can't even tell what it looks like.

13
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.166
Long Shuai's identity is indeed a high-level gold coin

14
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.066
Even the Northland can't see the real face

15
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.300
And that's a picture of the king of the United States three months ago.

16
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.466
You won't need to say anything in the future

17
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.266
Although I can't see the appearance clearly

18
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.966
But Long Shuai's eyes are indeed very similar

19
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.600
That's right, the body shape is also very similar

20
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.600
Is he really a dragon?

21
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.533
Don't guess

22
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.133
There's no animal in this picture at all.

23
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.800
I talked to him on the phone three months ago

24
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.966
He was serving in front of the Third Hospital in Beijing at that time

25
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.500
I know my mother said he went to Beijing to join the army

26
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.833
Didn't go abroad at all

27
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.766
If so

28
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.000
Standing on the sorting line on the stage is not harmful

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.600
Handsome belt hahaha

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.100
Then I understand

31
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.766
Did you serve as a soldier in Beijing?

32
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.366
He must have seen Lord Long Shuai

33
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.233
I know that Lord Long Shuai has a good life with himself

34
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.866
So I specially came to Haicheng to pretend to be Long Shuai

35
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.200
How do you satisfy your vanity, don't you?

36
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.166
I see.

37
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.300
He knows some real information about Long Shao

38
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.366
To deceive everyone

39
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.466
So despicable

40
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.766
Nonsense

41
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.033
I wasn't there three months ago.

42
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.266
The truth of the matter is

43
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.600
At that time, the king of the North came to Beijing for state affairs in our country

44
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.066
main stick

45
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.633
At team headquarters

46
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.400
Secret look back with me

47
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.700
You are so cunning

48
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.966
Knowing that your lies are about to be exposed

49
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:35.733
So deliberately fabricating facts

50
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.266
You continue to deceive and fight, don't you?

51
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.100
Business trip hello baby

52
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.866
Yeah, we're awesome

53
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.366
Everyone borrows money

54
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.366
This gentleman is right

55
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.100
3 yuan.

56
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.300
The king of our country did go to the mansion for formatting

57
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.733
And on the way

58
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:51.600
A big shot

59
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.233
For hours of secret meetings

60
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.466
That big shot

61
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:56.833
Who has eight or nine

62
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.466
This gentleman on stage
