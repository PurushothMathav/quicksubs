Under Marotai, see Lord Long Shuai

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.766
Get up, Xie Longshuai

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.533
You came just in time

You already know why I sent you, right?

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.500
Rural adults plan to hold an investment promotion conference

Create Phoenix for Haicheng to attract investment

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.933
The common people are good

12
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.800
Do it now

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.900
It includes this time's investment promotion meeting.

14
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.100
The scale must be large

15
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.866
This Marshal must let the people of Haicheng

16
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.066
Live a better life

17
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.066

Lord Dong Shuai

19
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.566
I have something to report

20
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.666
Said that there was news from the imperial capital

21
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.866
After the new governor takes office

22
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.500
Li Wei can only be investigated by the pattern

23
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.566
In addition, the bearer Wei Jun from the imperial capital

24
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.500
We can't reach Haicheng until after the third term.

25
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.366
Only then can the Feng family be sent to Niguta

26
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:47.866
So be it.

27
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.600
It is to let the imperial capital arrange for the subordinates to retire

28
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
Light Snow

29
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.100
I told you to go back early and rest for a while.

30
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.800

34
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.200
But ah but what
