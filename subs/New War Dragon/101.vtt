00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.500
Miss, why did you let me out?

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.466
Tell the truth

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.700
I'm pregnant too.

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.600
Defend mother

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.666
I don't want your child to be safe.

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.600
I will carry out the execution with you

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.766
I used to be so nice to you

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.333
You are so nice to me

9
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.066
In the end, I should still thank you.

10
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.566
If you hadn't taken the initiative to leave

11
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.666
How can I be with Brother Chu Qing?

12
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.300
Miss, in fact, you have already liked it

13
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.100
Right, sister, what did you say?

14
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.766
He was my brother-in-law

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.900
How can I even think about that?

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.633
In fact, I already guessed it

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.700
Xiaoxue, you are kind-hearted

18
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.200
In fact, you and Chu Chen are a match made in heaven

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.666
By the way, sister, I secretly let you out.

20
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.900
Don't let anyone know when you come out

21
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.100
I will hide

22
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.533
Live stream child birth

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.600
Xiaoxue thank you

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.900
I gave up on my sister

25
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.333
Brother Qiu Cheng, you won't blame me

26
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.666
Xiao Shen, you are kind-hearted.

27
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.300
Saw his unborn child break up and release him from prison

28
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.366
Happy can't afford to play

29
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.133
How can I blame you for being so rude?

30
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.500
Can you spare his life?

31
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.366
After all

32
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.266
He's the father.

33
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.700
Eating, catching them all

34
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.700
Connected to my heart

35
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.900
He is afraid that he will not live long after being crippled.

36
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.900
Today?

37
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.200
I will take good care of our children when I die

38
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.366
To educate him

39
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.166
Be a good person

40
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.566
Don't be like me

41
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.600
Yes, I will.

42
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.233
Dominate our summer

43
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.100
Two streams not seen

44
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.266
Pardon me?
