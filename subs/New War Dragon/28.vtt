1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.800
Is he really Long Shuai?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.000
It can't be.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.266
Lord Chen is the king of the country

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.866
How could you be with such a waste?

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.066
Have a secret meeting?

6
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.200
It must be a mistake.

7
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.866
Why don't you check again?

8
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.866
Governor Li of Haicheng

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.066
Without him, he is not Lu Shuai at all

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.933
Lord Li is here, Lord Li

11
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.300
How do you know he's not Long Shuai?

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.666
The governor of the marching TV has to have evidence, right?

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.166
The governor received news last night

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:35.066
Lord Long Shuai killed several imperial spies in Beijing

15
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.100
Minister is a hero

16
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.933
I can't prove my identity today

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.400
Lord Long Shuai was still killing the enemy in Beijing last night

18
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.566
How could he appear in Haicheng today?

19
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.666
I guess you're right.

20
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.933
It takes 3 days at the fastest to fly from Beijing to Haicheng

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.133
So storing this Long Shuai must be counterfeit.

22
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.966
I knew he was a liar.

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.666
It's impossible for me to become a phoenix

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:59.100
Lord Li, Chu Chen is guilty of impersonating Long Shuai

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
Please rectify him immediately

26
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.066
Governor's Guard on command

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.066
Raise the gun on the spot posing as the dragon commander
