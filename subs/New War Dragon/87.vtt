00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.966
Xiaoxue, have you thought about it?

2
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.833
Brother Chu Chen loves you very much

3
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.466
I figured it out.

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.200
He spends all day drinking and drinking

5
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.666
I had no common language with him before

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000
There must be a misunderstanding between the two of you.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.733
I saw him embracing to the left with my own eyes

8
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.733
Hugging on the right, drinking with two girls

9
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.100
Can this be fake?

10
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.133
Well, give me a few days.

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.333
I'll ask Brother Zhu Cheng.

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.766
See what's going on

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.466
Well, a week at most.

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.366
If he can't give me a satisfactory answer

15
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.200
I will definitely divorce him

16
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.166
I also don't want my child to be born

17
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.766
Just a jerk father like me

18
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.366
Brother Chen, come and drink

19
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.400
Drink, drink, drink, eat or not, what do you look like?

20
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.266
Oh.

21
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.200
Does it have something to do with you?

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.833
Xiaoxue is going to divorce you, do you know?

23
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.366
It's over

24
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.633
I've been wanting to divorce you for a long time

25
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.266
Brother Dust, you are not such a person, I know

26
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.133
Tell me what's your problem.

27
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.166
Excuse me?

28
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.666
Then you're really wrong.

29
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.766
That's who I am

30
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.066
Hahaha Miss Wu

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.266
If you have nothing to do, hurry up and leave, okay?

32
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.466
Don't go

33
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.133
I don't pay

34
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.300
Do you want to play with us?

35
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.233
Come on, hahaha, Brother Ming, drink, drink

36
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.766
What to drink

37
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.100
A few bitches, get out of here

38
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.400
Who are you? Just nosy

39
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.133
OK

40
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.766
Take the money and go
