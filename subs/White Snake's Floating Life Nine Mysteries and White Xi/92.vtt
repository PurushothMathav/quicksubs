00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.300
White West White West

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.266
Are you all right?

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.200
I also know you don't want to believe it

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.600
The past few years with Ye Xuan

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.700
I certainly hope that's not true either.

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.333
But you didn't see it just now.

7
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.666
I saw it with my own eyes

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.900
Ye Xuan has been controlled

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.333
So far

10
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.700
His life is no longer his own

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.300
If he really had to do it

12
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.400
Are you really willing to die for his throne?

13
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.233
Why don't we find a way to escape?

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.500
Hey

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.500
Little idiot

16
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.033
What were you thinking?

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.300
It doesn't matter.

18
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.366
I'll do whatever you want

19
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.566
elder sister

20
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.166
I can't escape

21
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.266
I don't know if I should say something

22
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:05.100
But when I devoured the emperor's blood

23
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.233
In my head

24
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.900
Suddenly some strange memories

25
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.066
Maybe add blood

26
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:17.400
Can bring back some lost memories

27
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.133
fair

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.466
You are back.

29
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.266
Who are you?

30
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:33.200
Who am I? That's a really hard answer.

31
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.066
But what I can answer is

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.933
Since you failed

33
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.900
It's been 19 years since he came back

34
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.766
Count the enchantment of Xuanzhou

35
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:45.100
Has it not been repaired for 19 years?

36
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.500
What is a barrier?

37
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.066
Enchantment? You can roughly understand it as

38
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:55.700
The enchantment is the barrier between the five continents and the wild

39
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.166
Related to ghosts
