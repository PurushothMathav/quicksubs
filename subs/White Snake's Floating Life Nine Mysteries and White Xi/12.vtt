00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.100
By the way, your world

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.766
If you leave something on an item

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.900
Whose imprint belongs to

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:13.200
What should I do? You're talking about taking pictures, right?

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.566
Yeah!

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
What does this night mean?

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.200
This night is our world

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000
The oldest photo gesture

9
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.466
Learn from me

10
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.800
Yeah, not bad.

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.666
elder sister

12
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.533
Isn't that so unfair to you?

13
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.200
Oh, it's okay.

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.633
I'm rotten everywhere

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.100
So?

16
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.500
If you want to talk, talk about it. Anyway, I'll be there in the future.

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.666
I'll protect you.

18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.700
Hey, you do look exactly the same

19
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.000
Let me see other places are different, sister.

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.700
Since you want to learn the sword

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.266
You must first become a swordsman and a sword to achieve the unity of man and sword

22
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.166
I want to see how your swordsmanship is first

23
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.100
Connected for several years

24
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.966
Ten years

25
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.000
Don't you want to learn swordplay with this old man?

26
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.766
When did your swordsmanship touch the old man's first foot?

27
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:28.066
The old man will pass on your swordsmanship

28
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.266
Stiff wrist

29
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.333
The power of first sight is too full and too hasty

30
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.100
At a glance, it is what happened to the swordsman who ended up

31
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.666
come again

32
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.100
Go you

33
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:02.000
What have I achieved in ancient times?

34
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.400
Brat, what's wrong with my pants?

35
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.800
OK

36
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.366
He is so cute!

37
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.666
Practice until you shut up

38
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.600
Ye Xian is awesome

39
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.833
Even so, the old man does what he says

40
00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.600
But before I teach you swordsmanship

41
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.400
You are responsible for the food and clothing expenses of me and the fair two

42
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.500
Grandpa, we eat alone

43
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.966
Or as the old saying goes

44
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:31.100
Hmm, what's your favorite meal?

45
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.733
Of course there is steamed lamb

46
00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:33.833
Steamed bear paw steamed deer tail

47
00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:34.866
Roast duck roast chicken

48
00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:35.700
Braised Pork with Roasted Goose Seeds

49
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.566
Braised duck sauce chicken bacon pine flower belly

50
00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:41.300
Steamed Babao Pig Sauce Rice Stuffed Duck Jar Pheasant Him

51
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.300
Are you reporting the name of the dish?
