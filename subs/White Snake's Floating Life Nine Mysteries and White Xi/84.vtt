1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.200
You are

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.666
Really?

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.633
I never thought of giving to others

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.600
You can blame me

5
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.166
Hate me

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.800
It's just the country.

7
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.366
I can only chew into your hands alone

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.800
But you must keep in mind

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.833
The mission of our imperial family

10
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.600
And responsibility

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.500
Don't panic

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.800
Don't panic

13
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.533
Ah!

14
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:46.900
Don't panic.

15
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.166
Maybe.

16
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.666
You must love poverty like a child in the future

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.300
Also gather at Ansiwei

18
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.500
Go ahead.

19
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:09.633
To develop your own hands and heart

20
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:14.000
Create your own country

21
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm so sorry, many people.

22
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm sorry, your mother.

23
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.833
Sorry for the late flight

24
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.566
Sorry, Mizawa

25
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
Sorry.

26
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.566
I'm sorry at night

27
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.700
I beg you.

28
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.633
We must protect them

29
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.400
Cher is late

30
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.100
Emperor Emperor

31
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.000
News from the Prince's Mansion

32
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.066
The princess gave birth
