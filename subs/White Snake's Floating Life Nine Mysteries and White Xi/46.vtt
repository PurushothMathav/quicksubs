National Preceptor National Preceptor

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.633
Your Highnesses, please take a seat

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.500
Don't break the rules for the minister

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.633
Your Highness

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.033
Inherit Wu Escape

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.200
If you secretly collude with his letter generals

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.100
The armies did not listen to the demolition of the imperial court

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.033
I'm afraid there will be endless troubles

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.666
Or hurry up

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.800
Bring it back to Shangjing

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.200
No, then just say it.

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.866
I will reverse this inheritance

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.566
My comrade, he will not rebel

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.200
This is a military family

15
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.266
Enemies are not from all over the place

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.633
The forces in the military are intricate

17
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.666
The general who succeeded Qin had a righteous rebellion

18
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.633
That's all.

19
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.300
Inherit my resignation and escape this time

20
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.133
Start with the King of Qin

21
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.866
Directly return the army to Shangjing

22
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.000
Said he was going to rebel

23
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.733
It's not an exaggeration

24
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.233
But but big brother

25
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.033
Don't worry.

26
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.666
In fact, we have not inherited the evidence of my rebellion

27
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:05.266
Let's get a warrant first

28
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.366
Why do I feel so pitiful about this big brother?

29
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.000
He shouldn't have imagined

30
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.400
Even the imperial teacher

31
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.000
He was also called by Ye Xuan to be a blackface, right?

32
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:25.033
You actually issued a warrant for your uncle

33
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.800
mother

34
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.966
Uncle, he can only return to Shangjing

35
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.100
To speak clearly

36
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.566
Make it clear

37
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.166
How to make it clear

38
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.966
It is taboo for him to bring troops back to Beijing

39
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.900
Now there are no soldiers

40
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.100
No more hidden battles

41
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.700
Back in Shangjing, only Yan Ren will take care of it.

42
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.400
Rebellion or not

43
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
It's not what we say

44
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.333
mother

45
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.366
Then you can reason with Phoenix.

46
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.100
Ye Xuan and Ye Li have been dead before

47
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.300
Half of the ministers in the DPRK do not believe them

48
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.466
Take refuge in the demon clan

49
00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.066
Now they're back.

50
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:09.100
I'm afraid someone is going to urge your father to make a crown prince

51
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.666
In today's form

52
00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:13.800
The imperial teacher is also on their side

53
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:18.200
We have fewer and fewer chess pieces in our hands

54
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.033
Only rely on your father

55
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.100
No way.

56
00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:27.800
But I can't give the chess pieces to Ye Xuan either

57
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.200
Really can't

58
00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:33.633
Ersheng doesn't want to be that emperor at all

59
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.000
confused

60
00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:45.266
So many years of history books have been read in vain

61
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:48.066
This emperor is something you can't do if you want to

62
00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.566
Why are you getting bigger and more disobedient now?

63
00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:52.366
mother

64
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:54.800
It's not that the son-in-law is disobedient

65
00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:57.466
And since the founding of the country

66
00:02:57.933 --> 00:02:58.500
Received every day

67
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.866
The most folds are

68
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.200
How many people have demons killed?

69
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.966
The son-in-law wants to find a way to live for the people

70
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.200
Kerson

71
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.633
There is no such ability at all

72
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:12.500
That doesn't work either

73
00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:16.266
I, Ji Jia, am the hero who fought the world with the former emperor

74
00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:17.600
My father sent Qin

75
00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:20.266
It is a hundred years outside the customs

76
00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.766
It was said that he intended to rebel

77
00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:24.966
inexplicable sudden death

78
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.200
The power of the family in the military today

79
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.666
Already great

80
00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:32.433
If you give this throne to Ye Xuan

81
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.266
He can still keep you alive

82
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.900
Really can't

83
00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:40.600
homeopathic rebellion

84
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.600
Also have to
