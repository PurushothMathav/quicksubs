1
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.666
But before the age of 20

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.100
If a newcomer misses

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.900
I want you to pay for this

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.733
At what cost?

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.900
If there is a calamity that endangers Xie'er's soul

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.800
It's Xie'er who can't be reincarnated

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.166
You must die for him

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.166
Ye Xuan, why are you here?

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.866
We're leaving now.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.066
Leave here

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.200
Huibishui Lake

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.433
Never come back

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.500
What about the common people?

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.466
Who will resist the demons when you go?

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.666
Who will stop the night

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.900
That's none of my business.

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.500
Let them fight as they want

18
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.266
Ye Xuan, stop making trouble

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.500
We can't go

20
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.266
We can't go

21
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.666
What's wrong with you?

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.200
What's wrong with you?

23
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.466
Didn't we agree to protect more people?

24
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.400
Isn't there a national teacher?

25
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.166
Can Harry be there?

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.100
There are so many generals and marshals

27
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.233
Why do you have to let me do it?

28
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.800
The dormitory is different for you.

29
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.400
You are different

30
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.400
If even you give up

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.200
Then no one can really protect them

32
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.766
No one can really save them

33
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.066
So what?

34
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.833
I can't be selfish

35
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.500
I have to see with my own eyes those close to me

36
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.433
Fall in front of me one by one?

37
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.266
Let go, I won't let go

38
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.000
Ye Xuan, we can't go

39
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.633
And you know what?

40
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.400
Brother Wang Junshou

41
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.900
And grandpa

42
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.433
They're all dead.

43
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.100
And you know what?

44
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.933
If we leave now

45
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.400
Then their deaths would be meaningless

46
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:44.966
So what?

47
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.366
This is because they are all dead

48
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:52.066
I can't let you die in front of me too

49
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.666
And you know what?

50
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.766
They asked me to kill you with the Zhenguo sword

51
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
It'll blow your mind away.

52
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.100
I can't leave you

53
00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.566
No matter which one you are

54
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.666
Brother Ye Xuan
