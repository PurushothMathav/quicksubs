00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.466
third brother

2
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.066
third brother

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.100
I ask you

4
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.200
The First Prince's rebellion

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.500
Did you arrange it?

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.566
Third brother, you know it all

7
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.066
Then do you think my chance

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.900
I ask you

9
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.400
Where is big brother

10
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.366
Where are you sorry?

11
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.433
Make you so intolerant of him

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.466
Ah, you know that big brother is soft-tempered

13
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.300
And forced him to rebel

14
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.400
Force him to die

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.900
third brother

16
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.500
how

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.833
Big brother is dead

18
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.966
Do you want me to pay for his life?

19
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.100
third brother

20
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.766
Aren't these all what you want?

21
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.233
You want to sit on the throne

22
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.966
That stupid king is so eccentric

23
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.666
How can big brother not die?

24
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.266
Concubine Ji, Concubine Ji has not always thought

25
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.166
Let the big brother force the father's work?

26
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600
Big brother doesn't have the guts

27
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.666
Then I'll give him a push.

28
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.166
Now.

29
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.733
Even if that dim lord is biased again

30
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.700
Must not be guaranteed

31
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.500
he

32
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.666
Now you're dead.

33
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.833
Your only obstacle is gone

34
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.500
how

35
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.833
Are you unhappy?

36
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.066
You fart

37
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.400
I never wanted my brother to die

38
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.100
You know the lotus seed soup that Father drank

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.800
Why? Is it poisonous?

40
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.400
Because the poison was eaten by the father himself

41
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.100
at night

42
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:56.233
Where is the big brother a threat to us?

43
00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:00.033
Growing up, he helped us with everything he could.

44
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.033
Without him

45
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.833
Can you live until now?

46
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.433
How can you bear it?

47
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.833
You

48
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.533
Do you have no heart?

49
00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.666
Ahahaha

50
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.800
Hahahaha

51
00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:23.500
Ha ha.

52
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.300
third brother

53
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.400
You know

54
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.900
You know, in order to get to where I am today

55
00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:35.866
How much did I pay?

56
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.233
Why do you think I killed them?

57
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.300
To save China

58
00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.366
Or to save those so-called common people?

59
00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:46.900
third brother

60
00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:50.233
It was your dream.

61
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.200
That's not mine.

62
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.800
I'm back here now.

63
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.066
Just to fulfill your dreams

64
00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.366
Third brother, in order to fulfill your dream

65
00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:05.300
How many people died

66
00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:08.433
What's up?

67
00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:11.233
Hahaha

68
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.033
Even if the whole world dies

69
00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:21.233
I will do it too
