00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:01.900
What's up?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.066
Regret

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.500
roll

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.400
I don't regret you go away

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.600
Get away from me

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.866
This seat really didn't expect

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.533
Since there are really people who can bear the soul

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.866
Burning pain

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.033
Hold on to death

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.366
Hahaha

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.466
This shows that

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.666
You demons

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.466
Not invincible anymore

14
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.166
at least

15
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.833
Even me.

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.066
I can also take your words as farts

17
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.266
I can forgive you for ignoring

18
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.766
Demons respect the strong

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.966
You have a gift.

20
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:56.000
I can give you another chance hahaha.

21
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.066
Ah!

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.700
You think beautifully

23
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.433
Want to convince me to deal with the third brother

24
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.366
Let me guess.

25
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.100
You won't.

26
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.666
You won't now

27
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.166
Can't you shoot yet?

28
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.633
Hahahaha, looks like I guessed it right.

29
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.833
You don't even dare to do bullying

30
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.266
Don't you dare not even do the right thing?

31
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.966
You are not a coward yet

32
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Then there is no way.

33
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.966
Then you'd better die.

34
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.066
You rubbish

35
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.266
Maybe your third brother thinks so too

36
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.000
After all

37
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:48.766
Who would want a dog that always follows them?

38
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:51.033
I'm going to fuck you white

39
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:54.033
Isn't that fair still a husband and wife with others?

40
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.966
What are you?

41
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.466
Maybe they've been thinking

42
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.266
Why don't you die?

43
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.400
When are you going to die?

44
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.100
If you die, they can shut up.

45
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.833
Hahaha, I'll kill you.

46
00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.166
I'll kill you!

47
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
Then you continue to deceive yourself

48
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.866
Wait a minute.

49
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.300
i

50
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:21.366
I promise you.

51
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.633
But I have one condition.

52
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.866
Good idea.

53
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.400
If you can do it

54
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:32.100
Yes, if I can do it.

55
00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:35.066
I want his heart

56
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.900
Certainly!

57
00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:40.866
So now

58
00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.566
Go kill someone for me first

59
00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.600
Drink it

60
00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:51.800
Drink it

61
00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:58.066
Grandpa grandpa

62
00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:00.300
Grandpa

63
00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:02.466
Ye Ye Xuan has become the prince

64
00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:05.466
We brought the Zhenguo sword back, grandpa

65
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:10.133
Grandpa

66
00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:14.166
Strange grandpa is not there

67
00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:17.100
He has never left here in all these years

68
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.366
Did the demon come here?

69
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.800
He won't be in danger, won't he?

70
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.300
Grandpa is a sword fairy

71
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.000
It'll be alright

72
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:28.966
Maybe he went out to relax

73
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.466
Xin'er if you are not at ease

74
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.600
We stayed for the night

75
00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:35.433
If grandpa doesn't come back tomorrow

76
00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:37.466
We left him a letter

77
00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:40.166
Let him see that he will go to Shangjing to find you in the future

78
00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:44.000
Well, that's it.
