00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.200
Hey, hey, hey.

2
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.266
What are you doing?

3
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.233
This official is a second-rank official of the imperial court

4
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.866
Are you going to rebel?

5
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.966
Well, open your dog eyes and see who we are

6
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.600
Ye Xuan

7
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.233
Ye Li

8
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.266
You are still alive

9
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.200
My nephew and my sister

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.366
So many people have been sent to find you

11
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.766
None of them survived.

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.466
I thought you were swallowed by a demon

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.400
Oh, what a pity.

14
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.900
It's a pity we're dying

15
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.900
This is not

16
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.633
Back for revenge on your siblings

17
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.533
Hahahaha

18
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.433
revenge

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.100
Believe it or not, I'm giving an order now

20
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.266
My relatives will come and puree you

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Hahaha, it's useless even if you kill me.

22
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:17.666
This way my nephew's country will be stable

23
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.466
Hahahaha

24
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.166
The people of this clear country

25
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.166
Let the demons kill them all

26
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.833
Where did the country come from?

27
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:30.800
But you can also call one and try it.

28
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.466
Right.

29
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500
Just...

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.000
Even if you call it a broken throat

31
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:43.166
No one will come to your rescue

32
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:44.866
What did you do?

33
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:45.900
Your Highnesses

34
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.700
Everything has been taken care of outside.

35
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.900
You ran to Wang Junshou's territory

36
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.266
Arrested people

37
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.600
You don't have the face to eat other people's food

38
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.066
Drink other people's wine

39
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.366
How big is your heart?

40
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.566
Now your green position

41
00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:07.466
And the officers loyal to you and their young positions

42
00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:09.400
We took them all down.

43
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.133
The pharmacy in the city is making a fortune today

44
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.500
Made a fortune

45
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:15.800
You witch

46
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.766
This official is the appointed official of the imperial court

47
00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.033
Have the right to ask

48
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:22.100
I want to write a bold letter to my sister
