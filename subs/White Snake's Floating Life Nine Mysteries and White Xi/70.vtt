1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.800
Wan Fei is dead

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.900
Muzer is also dead

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.833
Luo Yufeng

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.866
Tell me about it.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.633
How much does your brother want to die?

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.066
Dare to create my ordinary

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.166
I also heard that

8
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.766
When Concubine Wan died

9
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.966
In my arms, I still hold the pieces of Mu Ze's masterpiece

10
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.600
He was faked dead.

11
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.433
Tell me about crashing to death.

12
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.266
How much does it hurt?

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.100
Father Emperor

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.800
peace of mind

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.433
That's all.

16
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.166
Prince's seat

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.366
I give it to you

18
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.633
Three days later

19
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.633
The imperial teacher will canonize you

20
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.600
And I want to be the prince

21
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:07.100
I want to personally lead troops to resist demons and ghosts

22
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.900
Pocon

23
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.766
Let's find someone else for this

24
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:13.933
Father Emperor

25
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.500
Demon ravages

26
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.666
My country of Qinzhou is already half of the country

27
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.000
Now people are distracted

28
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.666
The son must be the crown prince

29
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.033
Win people's hearts for the father

30
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.633
Secondary fighting spirit

31
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.966
Is it possible to turn defeat into victory once?

32
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.033
Say

33
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.700
The people died

34
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.166
Soldiers died

35
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.666
The sheriff died

36
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.633
How can I not die?

37
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.400
Could it be that the man of my heaven

38
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.300
Are they all cowards?

39
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.166
OK

40
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.633
You go

41
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:00.266
Thank you father

42
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.100
And the minister retires

43
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:04.166
Ye Xuan

44
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:09.833
I ask you about the Moser rebellion

45
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:12.266
You really don't know

46
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.633
What does father mean?

47
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.966
Moser was soft since childhood

48
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:20.733
Even if I remember when my strength was greatest

49
00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:23.100
I never thought of causing my opposition

50
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.500
You say

51
00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:31.266
You really don't know

52
00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:35.666
Father, you are just saying that

53
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.100
It's all over
