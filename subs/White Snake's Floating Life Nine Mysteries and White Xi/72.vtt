1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.466
Third brother is afraid of me

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.800
The fourth brother went to tell the third brother not to be afraid

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.166
I am here

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.866
And the rights my mother left me 30,000 the Imperial Army

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.466
Can be handed over to you together

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.700
Big brother really doesn't want to fight with you, fourth brother

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.766
Big brother really doesn't want to argue with you?

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.166
The people of the world matter

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.633
You know it.

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.833
So fourth brother

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.866
Wait for me for a while

12
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.000
I'll get you a soldier's talisman

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.200
big brother

14
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.200
It's too late.

15
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:43.433
How can you sleep tonight?

16
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.200
big brother

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.300
You see

18
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.633
Outside the house?

19
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.366
But it's all on fire

20
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.433
The fourth brother is the unity

21
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.266
big brother

22
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.166
You'll see in a minute.

23
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.833
How to choose the road here

24
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.400
big brother

25
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.800
Pick it up yourself

26
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.266
Ah!

27
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.833
Hahahaha

28
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.066
His Royal Highness the First Prince

29
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.500
My subordinates got the first prince's discount

30
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.800
He brought someone to kill him

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.100
Everyone is there

32
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.966
Really do it tonight

33
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:39.600
hands-on

34
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:51.000
The Emperor's Imperial Army has been comforted and controlled

35
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.900
Muze

36
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.700
You haven't been with the minister for a long time

37
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.400
Say it well

38
00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:04.533
Father Emperor

39
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.366
Since the demon crossed Yuchun Pass

40
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.266
The second minister sank in the imperial kitchen all day

41
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.833
I want to make a living for the people

42
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:17.300
So

43
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.766
So far, I have no time to see my father

44
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.433
Father is not surprising

45
00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:24.366
Hey

46
00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.400
You did a great job.

47
00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.633
You are for the people who have known

48
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:40.666
Good job.

49
00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.800
only

50
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.500
Can't do chores like this

51
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.633
Look at you

52
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.433
All lost weight

53
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.666
The father is the position of the children and grandchildren

54
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.033
And how dare this disappoint his father?

55
00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:03.766
You have been weak since you were a child

56
00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.166
I don't know if it was when your mother gave birth to you

57
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.300
Infected with cold

58
00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.666
The wind is always warm

59
00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:15.966
At that time, Father wanted to take you to the imperial garden

60
00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:17.666
Your mother is good

61
00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:21.033
Wrap you up with only two eyes left

62
00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:24.766
A zongzi spirit

63
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.466
Oh, dear.

64
00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:33.200
That's your first time out to play

65
00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.666
Be curious about everything

66
00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:39.233
Turn East

67
00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:41.566
Turn West

68
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.433
And finally.

69
00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:48.833
Accidentally fell into the river, father

70
00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:52.533
I remember it really clearly

71
00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:54.300
Of course it's clear.

72
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.166
After going back that time

73
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.400
You catch a cold

74
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.900
He was crying.

75
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.833
Cry for me

76
00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.000
The heart is like being held by someone

77
00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.366
The dog that provoked your father to be scolded by your mother

78
00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:15.466
Bloody head since then

79
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.500
I am most afraid of you
