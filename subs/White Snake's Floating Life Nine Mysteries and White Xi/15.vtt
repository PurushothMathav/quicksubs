00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.533
Grandpa

2
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.033
What's up

3
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.300
Can you give me that carry-on jade pendant when I was a child?

4
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.033
You almost lost it

5
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.400
I'll keep it for you.

6
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.466
Now that you're by my side, there's no danger

7
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.033
What's the use of him

8
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.866
I want to give it to Ye Xuan

9
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.833
You want to give it to Ye Xuan

10
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.100
Well, Ye Xuan is more susceptible to danger than me

11
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.433
Although I haven't figured out how to talk to him yet

12
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.466
You can just say you can give yourself to him.

13
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.200
You can't hum

14
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.733
How long has he been here?

15
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.033
Are you using such a precious thing?

16
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.666
Why don't I see you filial piety and filial piety to your grandfather and me?

17
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.500
You white-eyed wolf, how about you?

18
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.966
Hey, by the way, and that mushroom.

19
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.933
You white-eyed wolf

20
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.900
White-eyed wolf I am not a wolf

21
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.100
White-eyed snake, okay?
