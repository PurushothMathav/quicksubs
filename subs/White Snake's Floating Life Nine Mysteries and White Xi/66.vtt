1
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:08.000
The winner comes to see the loser's embarrassment?

2
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.533
Ye Xuan

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.166
You are really smart

4
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.500
I've been thinking about it these days

5
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.066
Who poisoned it?

6
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.966
Hmm, now I understand.

7
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.300
Lotus seed soup is not poisonous at all

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.300
Right?

9
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.166
Right

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.700
Not poisonous

11
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.500
So

12
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.900
The poison you forced the emperor to eat

13
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.133
purpose

14
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.366
It's just an excuse to get rid of the pricing.

15
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.966
Am I right?

16
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.500
You can even use your own father

17
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.233
You are 10 times more vicious than me

18
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.233
how

19
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.766
Do not speak

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.466
Are you disdainful to talk to this palace?

21
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.200
Maybe.

22
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.900
Do you think now

23
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.966
The entire queen

24
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.666
It's all under your control

25
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.800
Aren't you being too naive?

26
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.766
Do you know

27
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:25.900
My chassis

28
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.900
You want to say

29
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.866
The palace 30,000 marching instructor

30
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.000
Are they yours?
