1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.500
Live to see people

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.433
Dead to see corpse

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.400
It's getting more and more chaotic outside the customs now.

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.966
Who knows those two little beasts?

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.266
Is he already dead?

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.033
how

7
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.166
Your Jiro will not die

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.766
My Jiro will die

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.766
General general

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.366
The general is bad

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.633
Something happened outside the customs

12
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.966
General Chen Fu's troops

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.833
Once defeated by that demon

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.633
Less than 30 percent survived.

15
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.433
How could this be?

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.466
It's only been a few days.

17
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.400
4,000 elite soldiers lost

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.333
Come on, I'm going to ask this blonde's crime in person

19
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.133
general

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.066
Chen Fu will die in battle

21
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.433
This time the demon is extraordinary

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.433
These years, there are more and more ghosts every year

23
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.266
Something will happen outside the customs sooner or later

24
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.066
general

25
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.566
Us soldiers

26
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.266
This has angered the wife and children to the point where Yucheng is closed

27
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.100
Anyway, there is no one outside the customs

28
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.766
Why don't we take the soldiers back to Yuchengguan?

29
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.066
Bullshit.

30
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.500
Soldiers don't know how to fight

31
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.366
Do you miss those pussy feet every day?

32
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.100
You're a fucking soldier

33
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.166
Come on, this time I will lead the troops myself

34
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:20.000
Let me see what this mere demon ghost refuses

35
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.233
Ye Xuan, it's raining, don't practice

36
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.366
I'll practice a little longer

37
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:38.500
You go back first

38
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.400
that

39
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.233
That day, Ye Xuan practiced his sword in the cold rain

40
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.300
And then of course fell ill and then

41
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.100
Grandpa student is sick

42
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.600
He was on fire.

43
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.766
I can't wake up no matter what I call

44
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:55.233
Please save him

45
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.966
Grandpa won't

46
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.233
This annoying typhoid fever

47
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.866
Grandpa won't have

48
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.366
You won't have either

49
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.866
So grandpa didn't fly to study how to treat it

50
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.833
Oops, don't look at it, what should I do?

51
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:11.966
Just let him carry it

52
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:16.066
Then I will use my heart protector.

53
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.366
Is that so?

54
00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:21.433
You put that stinky rag on his forehead

55
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:22.833
Soak in cold water

56
00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.866
It should be fine soon. Okay.

57
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.366
Xi'er

58
00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:30.533
It takes thousands of years of practice for your mind to produce a piece

59
00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.666
Can give birth to the dead and flesh and bones

60
00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.100
How can it be used on such a small set?

61
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.866
Don't worry.

62
00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:38.200
Otherwise, the kid's dog life will be known

63
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.466
Don't put your mind on that stinky boy

64
00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.633
Got it.

65
00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:44.266
Female college students do not stay in middle school

66
00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:29.066
This is pretending

67
00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:30.466
It's overdone.

68
00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:33.033
Sister, please say less

69
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.700
Ye Xuan is like this

70
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.200
I don't know if this is going to work.

71
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.033
Aren't you cold blooded?

72
00:03:40.066 --> 00:03:42.466
Why don't you put your hand directly on his head?

73
00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:43.566
Cool him down

74
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.833
Can it work? Probably
