00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.233
Brother Ye Juan

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.300
Shh, shh, we seem to have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.666
Kidnapping why how do I know

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.100
I just woke up

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:15.033
But I read countless articles

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.266
The experience of reading the text has taught me

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.266
When I woke up, the room was changed, not in the hospital

8
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.866
Is kidnapped

9
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.466
Who is that?

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.033
Your Highness

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.500
Please change. Do the new clothes look good?

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.033
Sister, it's the first time I see you so happy.

13
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.933
It's been two years, and I only have a few clothes.

14
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.066
I washed, I wore, I washed, I wore, I washed.

15
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.400
I went to town to buy the same style.

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.400
It's killing me.

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.700
Your Highness, please follow me to meet the elders of the clan

18
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:04.966
Hi.

19
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.166
It seems that His Highness' cultivation and skills have not been restored

20
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.833
It doesn't matter if it hasn't recovered yet

21
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.100
Start practicing today

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.466
Maintain the cultivation base of the Mending Heaven Formation Eye

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.500
I have a little question I would like to ask

24
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:23.866
You tied me up

25
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.366
Well, I mean, you invited me here.

26
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:30.166
To fix that eye

27
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.833
Because I am His Highness

28
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:33.700
Exactly.

29
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.033
I will inform you in detail when His Royal Highness is a Xianxia

30
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.633
Then can I think

31
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.633
I can't just leave here anymore

32
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.200
Your job

33
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
I mean can you get someone else to do this job?

34
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.966
Your Highness

35
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.666
As the purest of Nuwa's descendants

36
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.400
There is no more suitable candidate than Nian

37
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.200
And the next tribulation will be successful

38
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.433
Empress is also possible

39
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.200
Do I have holidays?

40
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.600
Of course not.

41
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:05.600
I want to fight again

42
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:09.600
Your Highness, this is um um um

43
00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:13.800
I smoke, don't I continue to work 007?
