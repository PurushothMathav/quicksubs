00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.966
Grandpa, Brother Ye Xuan, I'm back

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.800
Grandpa, oops

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.533
Xiner, why are you back?

4
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.266
I am pregnant

5
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.433
Ye Xuan's

6
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.766
Hey, you'd better go back to Xuantian Shrine

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.766
It's not safe here anymore what's not safe anymore

8
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.300
Grandpa

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.500
I suddenly feel that what you say is very reasonable.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.300
Why don't you tie me up

11
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.400
Tie it up and send it back

12
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.133
Sister, we just escaped

13
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.466
How can I go back?

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.466
But it's really dangerous outside

15
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.766
Listen to what your grandfather said

16
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.000
There is danger.

17
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.966
But if my sister goes back now

18
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.033
The baby in the womb may die

19
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.433
You will die too

20
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.066
Grandpa

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.266
You clearly know that there are two souls in my body

22
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.133
You asked them to pick me up early

23
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.033
Didn't you ask me to die?

24
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.500
Are you so noisy?

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.900
Xi'er, don't worry.

26
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:14.000
It has been two years since you entered Xi'er's body

27
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.166
It has not affected the eye of the replenishing formation

28
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:20.300
That's why grandpa asked him to take you back

29
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.500
That's risky too

30
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.500
How can you?

31
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.000
Ah wait a minute

32
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.633
Wait a minute, don't be noisy

33
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.266
What about brother Ye Xuan?

34
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.300
Hey he

35
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.300
Went back to Shangjing

36
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.200
Why did the demons invade Xuanzhou?

37
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.400
He wants to take responsibility.

38
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.766
Then I'll help him.

39
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.000
I can help him.

40
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.366
What's the use of you being strong alone

41
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.566
Shortly after Ye Xuan left

42
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.800
There is a Xuanmao demon clan to warn

43
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.100
The demons have invaded Jade City Pass

44
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:56.666
I'm afraid that Ye Xuan's anti-border journey is difficult

45
00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.866
Xi'er, you should go back to Xuantian Shrine

46
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.333
Xuanzhou is not safe

47
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.800
We're family.

48
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.300
How can I let Brother Ye Xuan bear it alone?

49
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.266
Cyrus, come back.

50
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.000
After I knew your identity, grandpa

51
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.100
I tried to cut off your connection with the eye of the sky-mending array

52
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.100
But in the end, they found that there was only one item.

53
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.200
Can do

54
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:30.500
He is in the treasure house of the Light Boat Kingdom Palace

55
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.366
You take it to grandpa

56
00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:35.333
Maybe it makes up for everything

57
00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:36.666
I'll be sure to get it for you.

58
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.233
Zhenguo Shenjian of Light Boat Kingdom

59
00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:44.500
You are so good, why don't you get it yourself?

60
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.266
You asked me to pick it up

61
00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:47.100
Why girl

62
00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.166
practitioner

63
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:53.700
He cannot conflict with the addition of his immortal blessing

64
00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:57.366
At first

65
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.766
Grandpa said there is no way to send you back to your original world

66
00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:02.433
I lied to you.

67
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.900
If you bring back the sword

68
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.066
Grandpa will help you go back

69
00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:09.233
Seriously

70
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.033
Really lying, it's a puppy

71
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.000
White-eyed snake

72
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.800
I heard the old dog

73
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.166
White-eyed snake, you dog old man
