1
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.533
Father Emperor

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.533
Emperor

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.433
Ye Xuan parting

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.766
You two haven't seen each other in a long time

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.466
He is the father

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.733
This is my wife.

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.800
His name is White

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.800
Haha, it looks watery

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.433
Good to do

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.400
Just like it too.

11
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.133
Father Emperor

12
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.366
The son has something to report

13
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:41.166
You want to ask about inheriting the rebellion, right?

14
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.566
This was sent by the Inheritance Wu Sect at the risk of death

15
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.833
The rebellion was caused by the coercion of his subordinates

16
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.700
He is just a puppet

17
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.366
Now he risks being discovered

18
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.266
You want to send a Xinbao princess.

19
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.466
Although Xiemu was incompetent in fighting wars

20
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.366
But Nianzai has always been loyal to the Ji family

21
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.500
Can give him a chance

22
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:17.766
Is that so?

23
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.000
I heard

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.766
It's been a pretty rough time inside the rebels.

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.166
Find a chance

26
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.866
Get him out of there.

27
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.000
Father Emperor

28
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.900
This letter is a forgery

29
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:35.000
The forged son thinks

30
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.433
He wanted to exonerate the inheritance

31
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.400
My brother is innocent

32
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.100
How to get rid of Ye Xuan

33
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.300
Don't be rude

34
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:47.100
You should call him Mother Concubine

35
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.966
Don't be suspicious

36
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:49.766
Father Emperor

37
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.366
Why does the son-in-law think this letter is forged?

38
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:53.566
Is because

39
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.666
The son also has a letter

40
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.600
gibberish

41
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.966
Are you trying to piss me off?

42
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.500
Emperor

43
00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:20.366
Emperor

44
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:26.066
Since the emperor has problems with both letters

45
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:27.866
Why not let the Royal Buddha check the authenticity?

46
00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:29.200
Just look up your notes
