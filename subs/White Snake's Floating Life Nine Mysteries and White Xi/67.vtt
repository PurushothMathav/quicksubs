00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.866
Because you are not at ease, big brother's character of not fighting or robbing

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.966
So your plan is

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.466
If something goes wrong

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.900
The marching instructor of the palace

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.466
The next day, he will take the First Prince hostage and rebel

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.500
Forced father's palace

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Right? I also know

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.000
These few years

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.633
You have countless opportunities to realize this plan

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.000
But because the eldest brother does not want to create a rebellion against the father

11
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.000
So right now?

12
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.666
How could you possibly know?

13
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.866
What's wrong with me?

14
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.233
What did you do to him, big brother is dead

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.900
left eye

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.100
Enter the coach and force the big brother to rebel

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.600
Big brother failed to rebel

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.833
Died in a consolation phenomenon

19
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.966
Impossible you lied to me I lied to you

20
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.466
Instructor's head

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.900
Has been sent outside the city gate

22
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.266
This is his suicide note to you

23
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.100
Because it's for you.

24
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.966
So I sent it to you.

25
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.433
You don't fail to recognize his self, do you?

26
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:12.900
Concubine Ji Gui

27
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.400
You killed him

28
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.566
Fake is fake

29
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.400
You must have killed him

30
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.700
It must be you.

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
He was so nice to you.

32
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.600
You treat him like this

33
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.466
I will curse you

34
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.033
I will curse you

35
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.800
Big brother life and death

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.366
I don't complain

37
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.900
He is a greeting brother

38
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.400
But this is it.

39
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.900
Let's mourn

40
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.466
Ye Xuan

41
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.233
Do you know why I hate you?

42
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:02.700
Because of your mother

43
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.033
Because I'm jealous of her

44
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:08.966
Obviously it's me

45
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.533
Obviously, I fell in love with the emperor first

46
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:15.333
Obviously it was me when he was still a prince

47
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.766
Right next to him

48
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.266
But why?

49
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.100
It's your mother who sits on this queen's seat

50
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.833
I hate that he always looks soft and weak.

51
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:29.400
I hate that he's always acting like

52
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.000
Let the disgruntled woman be the company

53
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.866
All he did

54
00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:38.033
It's just to make the emperor care about him

55
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:41.900
Otherwise, how could you give birth to a little beast like you?

56
00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.366
I envy him.

57
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.633
I'm jealous he's going crazy

58
00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:51.366
You'll never understand this feeling

59
00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:56.400
Do you think I want to?

60
00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:01.200
10 years of praise

61
00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:03.600
One day.

62
00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:06.266
But the love of the one you love the most

63
00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:08.433
Share the feelings of others

64
00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:11.866
I can't accept it.

65
00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:16.233
So I had to kill him.

66
00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:20.100
And you.

67
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.800
You've been a beast since you were a kid

68
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.200
Since your mother died

69
00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:28.033
Become like a ghost

70
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.833
There's always something hidden in the house

71
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.600
So young to know to poison my son

72
00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:39.066
So I'm afraid of you

73
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.833
I was terrified.

74
00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:43.800
So I'm going to let you die
