00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.800
You know each other?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.900
No no no don't know

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.633
I'm alive because of him.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.200
By the way, why are you here?

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.433
i

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.400
It should be chased by two demons

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.866
Chased here

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.000
I don't know what happened later

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.100
I... I got it.

10
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.933
It must be because of Brother Ye Xuan that he left first

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.500
Two demons saved your brother's life

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.966
Then you fainted when you were exhausted

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.033
Hahaha uh

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.800
It should be so, it must be

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.833
Then thank you, third brother

16
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.266
What are brothers talking about?

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.700
You can live

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.033
We can meet again

19
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.566
Better than anything

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:45.933
OK

21
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.033
Are you not feeling well?

22
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.200
Ah.

23
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.200
It's okay. It's okay.

24
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.066
Come on.

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.600
Third sister-in-law

26
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.866
After midnight

27
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.300
I'll just keep watch

28
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.200
You go to sleep first

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.666
No, I'm not sleepy.

30
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.600
Third sister-in-law

31
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.233
Can you use a sword?

32
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.566
Yes.

33
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.566
But brother, you don't even have a sword

34
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.833
Dare to run around alone

35
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.600
It's dangerous.

36
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.133
that sister-in-law

37
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.900
I used to have a sword too

38
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Only not that long ago.

39
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.966
I lost it, oops.

40
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.566
Isn't that a coincidence?

41
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:47.500
I just picked up this sword not long ago

42
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.766
It can't be yours, right?

43
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.366
Is there such a coincidence?
