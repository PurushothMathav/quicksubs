00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.400
Ye Xuan, you are awake, you are finally awake

2
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.600
You are

3
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.233
Cool myself down

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.700
How long have you been so motionless? I don't know.

5
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.400
Your hands are freezing!

6
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.500
Because I am a snake

7
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
So it doesn't matter if it's cold.

8
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:43.100
But you have been burning for the past two days and have been unable to wake up.

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.900
I'm afraid my brain will burn out

10
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.700
So I dare not move

11
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.833
What are you looking at me for?

12
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.766
I just feel like

13
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.600
It's good to have you.

14
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.200
Just fucking remember I have something to do

15
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.300
I'll go first

16
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.366
Brother Ye Xian, you have succeeded

17
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.833
It worked. I did it.

18
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.500
Yo, I've called my brother.

19
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.700
roll

20
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.500
Hahahahaha

21
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:12.033
Hahaha

22
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.400
fair

23
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.166
I finally found you.

24
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.300
Hahahaha

25
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.033
Where did the devil dare to cherish and be disadvantageous?

26
00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:36.166
Yeah.

27
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.033
This thing can actually block the old man's time
