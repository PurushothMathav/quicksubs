00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:01.766
The first one.

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:04.966
The first one.

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.433
Ah, the first one.

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.266
Ye Xuan, are you practicing swordplay?

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.400
I'm thinking about the old saying

6
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.333
He means or says

7
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.866
You practiced before

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.200
It's not even a sword move for him

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.066
Only this sword can be trained into a real sword move

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.766
I don't know with this sword

11
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.066
Can you protect some people? Some people?

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.266
Who?

13
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.766
You and me

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.666
There are many more people in the world

15
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.566
Can't stand the substitution

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.733
Hey, didn't you think about it?

17
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.133
My grandfather was actually lying to you.

18
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.300
He didn't even teach you a single move

19
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.900
How could I not have thought about it?

20
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.766
But I have nothing.

21
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.300
What can you get by lying to me? You are so weird

22
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.966
If all this is false

23
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.300
What's the point of that?

24
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.966
My mother once told me

25
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.633
A lot of times people live for certain beliefs

26
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.633
Without hope and without faith

27
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.300
Can't be called a person

28
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.233
Just the walking dead

29
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.000
Meaning needs to be given by yourself

30
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.766
Besides, who says it's all fake?

31
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.466
It's not fake that I'm alive

32
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.966
Everything here is not fake and

33
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.200
You are not fake

34
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.166
Yo, that's disgusting.

35
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.633
Brother's words are reasonable

36
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.766
Going to hibernate

37
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.400
You're about to hibernate

38
00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:27.500
Don't want me, I want to watch Ye Xuan practice swordplay
