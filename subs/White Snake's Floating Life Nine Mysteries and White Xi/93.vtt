1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.166
So it's because of me

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.833
So do I still have a chance to fix it?

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.866
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.700
You are no longer the foundation of the Xuantian Snake Tribe

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.400
The next one should be your daughter

6
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.400
But according to her age

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.766
She can't handle this responsibility for at least 300 years

8
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.300
What to do then?

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.233
Just ignore it?

10
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.266
There is another way

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.966
As the foundation of the Xuantian snake clan

12
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.133
You keep the blessings of Empress Nuwa in your body

13
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:33.800
Next one

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.766
Colorful streamer stone

15
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:40.500
The power in it allows you to use three curses

16
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.366
Its cursed nature

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.566
It is a force that contains the instinct of heaven and earth

18
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.033
You can turn a curse into a blessing

19
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.100
Repair the enchantment

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.000
But you need to pay attention

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.633
Once a curse has been targeted, it cannot be changed

22
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.366
Of course, if there are some more difficult curses

23
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.300
But you have to exchange it for something else

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.733
Such as the time interval between reincarnations

25
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.800
And the cost of using colorful streamers

26
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.833
Please complete the fall of the divine body

27
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.500
Can you save them?

28
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:21.966
Great so I can't run away

29
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.966
This is saving Xuanzhou

30
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.366
It's the only way to save the long story

31
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.966
Even if he can't do it

32
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.833
I will help him too

33
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.966
Hey so

34
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.300
The trolley problem of our world

35
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.300
It shouldn't be a problem for you, right?

36
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.900
What is the tram puzzle?

37
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:45.633
Is it the death of a group of people or the death of one person?

38
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.633
If that person were me

39
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.866
My death can change a group of people to live

40
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.000
Then I will choose this choice without hesitation

41
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.400
It's with me.

42
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.733
This kind of problem

43
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:58.300
It never seems to be torn

44
00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:02.300
One person dies for a group of people live

45
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.533
According to my sister

46
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.300
Isn't that a sure thing?

47
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.100
Hey, you are not allowed to imitate me

48
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.833
I'm a loser

49
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.366
But you are a fairy

50
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.600
The silly white sweet I have raised for so long

51
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:17.600
Although yes

52
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.900
But I always feel that you are sending it for a man.

53
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.633
I really can't bear to die

54
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.033
Hey, but it doesn't matter.

55
00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.066
I promised your grandfather

56
00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.866
Will keep you alive
