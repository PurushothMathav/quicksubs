00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.200
2 people show up

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.833
It's easier to speak

3
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.466
We are here to pick up the Hui from the foundation

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.966
You're early.

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.566
Keele is under 20 years old

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.766
There was a change in the eye of the sky-mending formation yesterday

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.300
The demon festival is damaged

8
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.233
It is no longer possible to restrict the demons from invading the human race on a large scale

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.433
The war between the human and demon races is about to begin

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.500
The elders are worried that if the imperial family continues to stay here

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.900
I'm afraid there will be danger.

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.400
Is that so?

13
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.266
Hill returns to the clan

14
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.466
Can you really force me to be safe here?

15
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.766
Ancient forgiveness

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.466
I'm afraid you will enter

17
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.266
court death

18
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:47.500
Ancient maybe not negotiable this time

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.900
Hahahahaha

20
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.366
Dusk of Heroes

21
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.100
You are no longer qualified to speak such big words

22
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.900
OK

23
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.466
Take him back

24
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.700
Do you know the stars?

25
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.966
he

26
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.666
Let's go!

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.766
He's gone now.

28
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:47.500
Where did you go hill

29
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.433
This is the descendant of Nuwa, the emperor of the Xuantian Snake Tribe

30
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.400
Sooner or later

31
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.966
I have to take on the responsibility of guarding the eye of the Mending Heaven Array in Xuantian Shrine

32
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.633
The task of maintaining the stability of heaven and earth

33
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.566
His people took him away.

34
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:04.900
Maintain the stability of heaven and earth

35
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:06.500
Do we have to let him come?

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.700
Why is there such a hurry?

37
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:12.100
They didn't even give us a chance to say goodbye

38
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.033
We just got here.

39
00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.600
I asked you.

40
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.700
Even if your future is uncertain

41
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.266
Then tell me

42
00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:21.166
Where did he go?

43
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:21.666
I'll go find him.

44
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:24.366
Ye Xuan wants to stay together forever

45
00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:26.433
You have to have that ability

46
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:27.700
You know now

47
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.133
How many monsters want his life?

48
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:30.966
Ah!

49
00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:35.300
Now the old man will do his best

50
00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:36.866
realm fall

51
00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:40.366
Otherwise, you wouldn't be in danger the day before yesterday.

52
00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:42.533
I pass on your swordsmanship

53
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.866
I meant for you to protect Xi'er

54
00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:46.033
pity

55
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.066
You're learning too slowly.

56
00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:51.100
It's good for Xi'er to go back.

57
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.700
Brother Ye Juan
