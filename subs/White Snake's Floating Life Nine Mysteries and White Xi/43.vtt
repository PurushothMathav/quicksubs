1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.600
Shangjing still has 30,000 to enter

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.033
Not enough at all.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.400
You don't have to listen to what your mother says

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.200
Imperial teacher is highly respected

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.833
Did you not listen to him?

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.466
As long as you go to the capital to gather enough concubines of soldiers

7
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.966
Can resist all other places

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.633
For hundreds of years.

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.800
But because of this

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.200
Let my uncle take away the defenders from all over the world

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.766
Regardless of the lives of the people

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.433
Who says I don't care about the lives of the people?

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.766
I try my best to get those people on camera

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500
I also let you open the warehouse to put grain

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.600
Countermeasures are inevitable

16
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.633
Some old, weak, sick and disabled will indeed die here

17
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.066
But we can't save everyone.

18
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.566
Abandoning an official and fleeing is also a felony

19
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.300
That's also the meaning of the fairy nest

20
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.800
How scary do you think demons are?

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.400
Maybe it won't take long to return it.

22
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.200
At that time, let the people adjust their health care

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.666
Is it also an opportunity?

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.966
He abandoned so many people on the road

25
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.300
All were killed by demons

26
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.133
I really don't know

27
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.166
What's wrong with this demon?

28
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.700
Can't fight yet

29
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.100
This year, my uncle quit the war without fighting

30
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.400
What qualifications does he have?

31
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.900
According to me, the general of Qinzhou should be ashamed and confused

32
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.366
If your uncle is a coward who is afraid of death

33
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.266
I can stay here for ten years

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:23.866
Concubine

35
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.366
I heard that he also got a cut from his son

36
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.033
But when did you make such a hurtful compromise?

37
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.633
I told you straight

38
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.866
This fold is for my mother

39
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.166
This year's ghosts are indeed not very good

40
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Your uncle can't hold on anymore

41
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.200
We have to preserve our strength.

42
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.000
You immediately send someone to catch the thief Ye Xuan

43
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.500
Ye Li, save your uncle, mother

44
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.766
The son-in-law can't make this fold

45
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:56.033
At this time, colleagues can no longer manipulate

46
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:59.500
You treat them as brothers

47
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:01.200
Do they think you are the big brother?

48
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.200
Don't think I don't know

49
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.900
You secretly sent people out just to save them

50
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.033
So weak

51
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.000
If I fall

52
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.700
You haven't been caught by them brothers for the first time

53
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.000
Gotta kill

54
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:16.266
mother

55
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.600
And since his father's strong country

56
00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:22.633
unbalanced external invasion

57
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.866
Bird civil strife

58
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.166
son

59
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.700
It's a death sentence.

60
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.500
Your Highness

61
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.800
The third prince and the fourth prince ask to see

62
00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:36.466
Here they are.
