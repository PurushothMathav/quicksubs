00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.166
Third brother third brother

2
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.633
inherit me

3
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.866
Didn't you think of it?

4
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.200
Lao Tzu is still alive

5
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm coming to see you off

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.633
Buried with my sister and my nephew

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.966
Third brother, third brother, wake up, third brother, wake up, wake up

8
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.000
Don't come and go

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.100
The third brother is mine

10
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.266
The third brother is mine

11
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.900
Get out of the way, third brother, how are you, third brother?

12
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.600
Good you're not dead.

13
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.500
Third brother, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.766
Actually I won't live long

15
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.700
You really joined the demon race

16
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.733
No third brother is not what you think

17
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.900
How many people have you hurt for me, fourth brother?

18
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.200
We shall never meet again

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.433
Please hit me.

20
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.200
Never had a brother like you

21
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.366
Okay.

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.166
I'm not leaving

23
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.433
We will never see each other again

24
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.433
Please, I never had you as a brother

25
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:33.900
third brother

26
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.366
Can you?

27
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.966
Can you touch my head again?

28
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.166
Like

29
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.966
Like when I was a kid

30
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.366
Ok?

31
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.300
Just once.

32
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:54.766
Even just once

33
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:59.766
Can you trust me?

34
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.100
I didn't want to hurt my brother either.

35
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.433
only

36
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.200
only

37
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.166
I'm afraid your dream won't come true

38
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.100
But

39
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.300
But now

40
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.366
Your dream is coming true

41
00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:20.766
also leave

42
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:24.400
Also dead

43
00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:27.500
It doesn't matter
