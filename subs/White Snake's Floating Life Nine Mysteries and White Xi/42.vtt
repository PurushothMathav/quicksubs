00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.033
You don't need your brother to do it.

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.833
Bringing back the living is more useful than bringing back the dead

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.700
In case he runs off on the road

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.466
It's not a legacy.

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.866
There is no good business without taking risks

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.800
I thought you would help the third brother in the future

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.066
I didn't expect it to be a woman's opinion of me

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.366
Don't talk to your third sister-in-law like that

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.433
I think so too.

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.000
He has a point.

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.466
Your Highness, please quickly take the Bing Fu command arrow

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.566
Take control of the army

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.033
Expel the demons and ghosts

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.366
OK

15
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.533
Empress

16
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.900
Something bad

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.200
The monster has hit Shangjing

18
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.666
Where's my brother? Where's his army?

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.766
Not a monster

20
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.566
It was General Ji who came back from the secret rumor

21
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.600
The general was captured by the third prince and the fourth prince

22
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.200
Military power was also taken away

23
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.000
All sent back to the fine army

24
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.200
They were all sent to resist the monsters

25
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.566
It turned out that these two little beasts came back

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.766
I thought I had taken over the military

27
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.033
Can you really control the soldiers?

28
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.400
Too naive

29
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.266
This palace will go to the eldest prince now

30
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.866
I'd like to see it

31
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:21.766
Do these two little beasts dare to hum back?

32
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.366
Your uncle's arrest is minor

33
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.766
The emptiness of the Shangjing guards is a big deal

34
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:34.466
At that time, this palace will connect with the emperor and you.

35
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.766
And the people of the city

36
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:37.800
Are you going to be reduced to fish on the felt board?
