00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.700
Brother Ye Xuan

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.066
This is for you.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.233
You take it to your father's town and sell it

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.066
Can you exchange it for 5kg of bright silver?

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.833
These are your scales. Hmm.

6
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.300
Doesn't it hurt to unplug so much? It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt.

7
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.800
It doesn't hurt at all.

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.400
It obviously hurts to death, okay?

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.766
Don't do this again

10
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.600
I know how to get the money.

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.700
Yochengguan

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.600
Just ahead.

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.033
OK

14
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.000
Nice work.

15
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.166
But no one was found

16
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
You can look for it again

17
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.833
If you can't find it

18
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.666
Hahahaha

19
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.766
Hahahaha

20
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.200
Hahahaha

21
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.366
fair

22
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.800
Brother Ye Xuan has eaten

23
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.500
Oh.

24
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.766
What is this?

25
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.866
Oh, it's herbal medicine.

26
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.400
Wild vegetables and mushrooms

27
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.466
I plan to

28
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:48.000
Sell them to the restaurants and pharmacies in town

29
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.533
These things can be used as medicine

30
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:51.666
You can also cook.

31
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.100
Awesome!

32
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.800
Each herb has its own unique uses

33
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:57.400
Like this one.

34
00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.400
This is called ghost foot mushroom.

35
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.233
If you take it for a long time, you will become smarter.

36
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.900
This is psychedelic, brother Ye Xuan, are you alright?

37
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.800
Yeah.

38
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.033
Why is it blooming on your head?

39
00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:33.366
Yeah.

40
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.266
Here are the roses.

41
00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.466
Here are the peonies

42
00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:42.200
Brother Ye Xuan, hahaha, are you really okay?

43
00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:43.433
White shoes

44
00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.466
I'm here now.

45
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.633
Every day is so happy, brother Bai Xi Yeshen

46
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.433
I'm so happy every day, hahahaha, Bai Xi

47
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.000
You are really, really beautiful

48
00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:02.333
Ah!

49
00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:08.300
Well, he's really good at talking nonsense, oops.
