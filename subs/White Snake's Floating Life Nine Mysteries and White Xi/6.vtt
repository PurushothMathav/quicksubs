00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.300
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.300
Not dead

3
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.766
I still have to rely on you to save me

4
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.100
When I get stronger

5
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.300
I'll pay you back.

6
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.366
Are you all right?

7
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm fair, sorry.

8
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.566
It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.800
Thank you just now for saving me

10
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.866
You are badly hurt

11
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.466
Lie down, why are you suddenly so good?

12
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.233
Let me help you.

13
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.300
I treated you like that

14
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.166
Don't you hate me?

15
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.233
Why hate

16
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.633
You see an injured puppy on the side of the road

17
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
Would you give up just because he bared his teeth at you?

18
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.266
Puppy

19
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.300
Don't you think

20
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.700
What you just looked like

21
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.766
Does it look like a wounded puppy on the side of the road?

22
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:24.033
Well, or you can change it to a kitten.

23
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.266
Let me tell you something.

24
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:26.733
OK

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.766
Why do you keep looking at me?

26
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.100
Listen to you

27
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.966
What's there to see when I talk?

28
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:42.866
Snow White

29
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.366
I think

30
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.300
What do you think?

31
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.533
Do you want to touch my chest?

32
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:49.900
I tell you little red

33
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.566
You now think you are also a crime

34
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.066
What do you think?
