1
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.366
The body has not been found

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.066
Three days ago

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.700
Why did you report today?

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.133
What about the people who do things?

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.566
Immediately wear that arrow

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.066
What's up?

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:19.700
The three groups of people the Empress went to find the Third Prince

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.166
The body was also lost

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.433
We only found the bodies of one group of people

10
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.200
They also found the Fourth Prince's token

11
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.566
The empress is angry with my empress

12
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.833
Before the third prince was sent away, there was a suspected penetrating wound in his chest

13
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.833
It's still the automatic hand of the empress.

14
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.900
The bloodline of the fairy family is bestowed on the fairy nest

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.500
It's a big tonic for ghosts

16
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.833
So maybe the third prince has long been

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.433
That can't relax either

18
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.500
Explain to the inheritance of Wu

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.233
Within three days

20
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.300
Find him dead or alive

21
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.266
And the Fourth Prince

22
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.500
Ben Gong missed this little thing

23
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.200
Is he going to avenge Ye Xuan?

24
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.000
Humph

25
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.100
A mere son of the wall

26
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.633
Dare to fight against this palace

27
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.100
Tell the inheritor

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.833
Since their relationship is so deep

29
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.700
Then send them to the reunion is to light up

30
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.500
I've been making money this month

31
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.433
Enough to cover our daily expenses

32
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.366
I also bought a sword for myself

33
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.966
This sword forged by mortals

34
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.400
Can't stand the power of the old man's swordsmanship

35
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.766
Need to practice again

36
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.200
Ye Xuan knows

37
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.900
Why are you laughing?

38
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.500
That way it can barely be used for a while

39
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.166
You first put the swordsmanship you learned

40
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:07.366
Just reply two tricks and show the old man.

41
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.100
Hey!

42
00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:12.366
come again

43
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.733
savvy swordsman

44
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:20.266
You can also take your own advice from it

45
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.466
Oh, I forgot

46
00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.566
You have no understanding

47
00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:29.866
You are good at swordsmanship, but if you don't teach it, you will know how to pretend to be an expert.

48
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.066
Ah.

49
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:34.266
But the feeling of this last resort is still on the shell

50
00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:37.466
Let's practice this trick in the future

51
00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:39.700
When will you practice?

52
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.366
Humph

53
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:45.166
Practice until you become the first sword you wield in your life
