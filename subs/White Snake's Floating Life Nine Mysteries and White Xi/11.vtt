00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.400
Normally

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.100
Shouldn't this kind of thing be invisible?

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.533
Your strange behavior just now

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.766
How could the old man not see it?

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.866
Grandpa, I didn't mean to

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.300
Is there any coincidence to seize the house?

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.600
But I really am

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.766
I literally walked through a door.

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.866
Then I came into this world

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.300
Seriously and your granddaughter is still there

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.100
We were just chatting

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.900
Grandpa, what this sister said is true

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.566
I kind of like him.

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Don't kill him, okay?

15
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.566
Ah oops, it's over, I'm going to die again

16
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.700
Ultraman, the eldest daughter of my ancestral family

17
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.033
Who are you here to save me?

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.633
strange

19
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.600
Your soul has no trace of cultivation

20
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.066
It's like taking the soul of a mortal

21
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.266
Stuffed into Hill's body

22
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.300
And completely not excluded

23
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.633
Even an old man can't do it

24
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.566
Those who possess such means

25
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.300
So you're going to let me go, right?

26
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.466
I knew you were a good person

27
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.400
Hmm, you think beautifully

28
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.466
Let the old man rest assured when you die

29
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:26.000
Gungun I'm not dead

30
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.566
SOS, you are so amazing

31
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.800
I don't even need to go to the ICU.

32
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.200
I went straight to the morgue

33
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.466
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.900
What ICU mortuary?

35
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.166
Not important.

36
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.100
Here's the thing.

37
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:45.666
You are so amazing hahaha

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.566
There must be a way

39
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.800
Get me out of this body

40
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.700
Then send it back to the original world

41
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.400
Take it out

42
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.800
Throw it back to the original world, the old man can't do it, ah ah

43
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.600
I was paralyzed.

44
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.800
i

45
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:05.833
I had a pretty good idea.

46
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:10.466
You must hear me out

47
00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.266
I think white

48
00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:18.666
I really like that wounded human prince

49
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:19.866
That is Ye Xuan

50
00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:20.666
What!

51
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.800
The old man killed him, ah, grandpa, don't be angry

52
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.666
You are so old

53
00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.966
Don't keep fighting and killing

54
00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:30.000
and

55
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.700
The fair child looks like a young girl at first glance.

56
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.333
You see, his love has not yet begun

57
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:38.933
You snuffed him out

58
00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:40.866
How sad it must be, isn't it?

59
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.200
What is an innocent girl?

60
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.966
Oops, it doesn't matter.

61
00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:49.066
The important thing is that he will be sad

62
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.100
He hates you when he's sad, doesn't he?

63
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.000
He hates you

64
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.433
Maybe I'll cut ties with you

65
00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.300
Old age and death never meet

66
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.933
Stop! Don't kill me

67
00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:04.266
Don't kill me don't kill me

68
00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:08.766
Xier and I are not related by blood

69
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.633
His people will take him back sooner or later

70
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.600
Return

71
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.833
How old are you?

72
00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:20.166
people

73
00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.600
Just turned 18

74
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.100
Whoops 25

75
00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:33.366
It's true this time. Hmm.

76
00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:34.266
future

77
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.133
You think your parents have been through a lot

78
00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.600
Well, to live

79
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.200
I recognize that Xi'er is innocent

80
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.466
uneasy world

81
00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:49.733
Now there is a causal entanglement in this human family

82
00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:53.233
There are some benefits to having you by his side

83
00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:02.866
This is a secret method I left behind

84
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.866
You can activate this secret technique at a critical moment

85
00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:08.566
Forcibly seize the body

86
00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:13.200
King Xie, this secret technique can also be used to save one's life

87
00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:17.766
At the age of 20, this body can be divided into two

88
00:04:17.766 --> 00:04:19.700
But before the age of 20

89
00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:22.566
What if Hill encounters any danger?

90
00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.600
I want you to seize his body by force

91
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.133
Die for him

92
00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:31.800
Otherwise, even if you escape to the ends of the earth

93
00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:35.033
I understand I understand
