1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.700
minister

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.166
lead

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.266
Oh, dear.

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.966
at night

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.666
Your sister-in-law is the fourth

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.666
The most lively personality

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.166
It was okay as a kid

8
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.800
The bigger, the less formal.

9
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.700
At the age of 12

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:32.500
Did you set the fire in Qi Fei's yard?

11
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.300
Fortunately, it was a holiday that day

12
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.066
No one big or small is there

13
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.366
Only my second prince is there

14
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:45.166
Zhou was so scared that he returned to his mother's southern border

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.666
Never dared to come back

16
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:49.966
Father Emperor

17
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.066
original

18
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.266
I know.

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.633
Ha ha.

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.900
I don't know anything

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.500
You really take me for a fool

22
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.400
Father Emperor

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.833
Is this to blame?

24
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.033
Blame you

25
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.400
During that time

26
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.633
Jai Zhou and your eldest brother, third brother

27
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.666
I can't take advantage of a day to live a stable life

28
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.433
In the Imperial House

29
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.966
dare to fight

30
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.300
dare to die

31
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:29.700
Besides, you didn't cause any disaster

32
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.166
I know

33
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.633
You have the best relationship with Ye Xuan

34
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.633
How about that?

35
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.466
I know you had a hard time as a child

36
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.033
Except for a lot of grievances

37
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.800
Only when it is good can Ye Xuan be there

38
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.500
I didn't let you learn bad

39
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.366
Later?

40
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.900
You still have to accept your temper

41
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.000
Help your third brother well

42
00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:08.000
Children take orders

43
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:11.800
It's all gone

44
00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.866
Also declared

45
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.166
I have something to say to him alone

46
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:26.300
The emperor's old slaves will not leave

47
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.300
The old slave will take care of you

48
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.633
Oops, step back, step back
