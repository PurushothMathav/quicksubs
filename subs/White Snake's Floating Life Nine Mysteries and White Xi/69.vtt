00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.766
Brother Ye Xuan is so smart

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.066
Shut up simp

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.700
You see

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:08.566
He has been putting up with this for 13 years

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.000
How dark is that?

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.500
But Ye Xuan

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.200
My brother will still cry for the injured people

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.966
Will be for Wang County

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.400
The soldiers who guard and defend the country

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
In fact, when the first prince died

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:27.033
I also saw Brother Ye Xuan crying secretly

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.600
Oops you so

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.966
I still think

14
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.700
Brother Ye Xuan's heart is actually very kind

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.900
His calculation

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.500
scheming

17
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.200
Not when he was young

18
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.700
Forced out step by step

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.100
I don't know why.

20
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.233
My sister always complained about Brother Ye Xuan

21
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.500
You white-eyed wolf

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.666
Who are you standing with?

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.566
Who am I doing this for?

24
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.200
It's all for you

25
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.300
I'm not afraid that one day

26
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.833
Will he give up on you for his throne?

27
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.200
Strange to say

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.966
In fact, when I first met him

29
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.666
I also think he is quite handsome

30
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.666
After meeting you later

31
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.200
I subconsciously

32
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.400
I want to protect you, a mentally retarded child

33
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.133
It's like protecting another me

34
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.566
It's actually quite fulfilling for a strategist not to go to the battlefield

35
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.833
Then I have to protect my sister too

36
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:24.366
Sister, you have a lot of strange words, oops, don't learn them.

37
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.633
Sister, let me show you something

38
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.500
Do you remember this wooden hairpin?

39
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.600
Of course I remember

40
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.900
Isn't this what you got married with?

41
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.466
You give him a jade pendant.

42
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.800
He gave you a wooden hairpin.

43
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.266
Completely unequal value

44
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.100
Aren't you stupid and wronged?

45
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.400
No.

46
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.566
In fact, this hairpin means a lot to me

47
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.733
A woman found it as a baby before

48
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:52.400
I've been raising me ever since I was adopted.

49
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.800
After she died

50
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:56.600
This is the only token she left me

51
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.666
I remember now.

52
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:00.266
That tomb hairpin was broken by Ye Xuan

53
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.666
Grandpa told me

54
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.400
Now this hairpin

55
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.866
It's brother Ye Xuan

56
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.966
It took many days to polish it.

57
00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:17.366
And there are a lot of small holes on his hands

58
00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:18.533
I'm heartbroken.

59
00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:20.900
So you just because of this

60
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.066
Put your utmost trust in him

61
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.600
Of course not.

62
00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:28.500
The only people who can be trusted in this world are people

63
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.966
My senses have always been accurate

64
00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:32.833
Like I think

65
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.633
Brother Ye Xuan, grandfather, and sister, you

66
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:38.066
You're all good people.

67
00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:38.900
that

68
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.466
What about Ye Lin?

69
00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.700
Not like good people

70
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.633
Humming, I see something and escape slightly
