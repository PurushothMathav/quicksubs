00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Last night I had a dream

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.600
I dreamed that I had traveled to another world

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.466
Into another girl's body

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:16.033
That dream was so long and true

5
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.200
I almost thought I wouldn't wake up

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.433
I still remember the last scene

7
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.800
Sister, have you ever considered

8
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.000
Maybe even if grandpa died

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I will also keep my promise to you.

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.800
Send you back to your original world

11
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.833
Then it took 10,000 years to reincarnate

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.366
What are you reading?

13
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.433
Emperor

14
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.633
Concubine Ji, you

15
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.700
No no no sorry

16
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.666
I got too involved.

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.500
That is to say, after completing the three curses of whiteness

18
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.100
It took 10,000 years to reincarnate

19
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.800
Why not reincarnate right away?

20
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.800
Why dad?

21
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.866
no.

22
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.966
Here's what the script says.

23
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.366
Probably a chance to reincarnate in 10,000 years

24
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.033
Did you change something important?

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.966
Of course, if there are some more difficult curses

26
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.066
But you have to use something else to exchange it.

27
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.433
Like the time between reincarnations

28
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.166
Hey, it's gone, it's gone.

29
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
What a dog screenwriter who wrote Muze so miserably

30
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:50.400
Should we change the name of our child?

31
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.833
This name doesn't seem very auspicious.

32
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:01.300
Okay, let's go, don't look
