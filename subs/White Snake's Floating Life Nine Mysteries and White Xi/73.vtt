00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.766
Father Emperor remembers so clearly

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.866
Maybe today.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
I really miss my son

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.666
Of course I want to

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.900
I think of you all the time

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.800
Remember when you were little

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.600
Father Emperor

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.833
I am old

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.300
I like to think about the past

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.866
Let's have a good chat today

11
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.033
Don't think I'm nagging

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.433
Remember when you were 7 years old?

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.666
And the minister has grown up

14
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.233
I always do things for those childhood things

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.200
Mo Ze has grown up

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.700
Shouldn't have mentioned

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.233
Shouldn't arrive

18
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.000
Go ahead.

19
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.200
Moser

20
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.700
If your mother hadn't forced you back then

21
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.866
What kind of person do you want to be?

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.000
What kind of person?

23
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.066
One can be at leisure

24
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.233
People who have traveled the great rivers and mountains of my light boat country

25
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.400
One can be tired and tired

26
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.833
Sleep soundly

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.266
Best.

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.266
A person who can write poetry

29
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.100
Father Emperor

30
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.100
It's a little selfish to say

31
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.266
And since I got rid of it

32
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.266
After those heavy academy memorials

33
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.566
Never thought about it again

34
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.400
How can we find a way out for the common people?

35
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.333
Never thought about it again

36
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.500
How can I live up to my mother's expectations?

37
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.400
I never thought about it again

38
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.633
How can I protect my brother?

39
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:58.966
Father Emperor

40
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.500
Second minister these years

41
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:05.233
Really tired

42
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.100
I ask you

43
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.466
What you said at first

44
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:14.266
To find a way out for the people of Qing Zhe Kingdom

45
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.066
Did you find it?

46
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.433
Then will you blame your father?

47
00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:24.833
No wonder.

48
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:31.100
First Prince, slow down

49
00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:34.900
The pain will go away soon.

50
00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.866
My son

51
00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:51.366
Why did you escape today's step?

52
00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:52.766
Ah father

53
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.700
Father, don't cry

54
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.066
Children are not allowed

55
00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:58.500
The father emperor who can't be a son

56
00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.400
The son-in-law is really happy, father and emperor

57
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.266
The emperor is so tired

58
00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:06.666
Children and grandchildren are so tired

59
00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:12.366
Son, hahaha.
