1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:04.566
Your Majesty's condition is not very good.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.466
How bad?

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.266
It is.

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.266
In recent days

5
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:16.966
When His Majesty calls, he doesn't know the time

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.466
Every day clamoring to see

7
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.833
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and His Royal Highness the Fourth Prince

8
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.166
Therefore, as soon as His Highness the Crown Prince comes back

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.933
The old slave took the Crown Prince and the Fourth Prince

10
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.266
It's all called back

11
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.466
Father Emperor

12
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.566
Father Emperor

13
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.166
Why doesn't my father ever come to see me?

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.100
Why do I always have to stay here?

15
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.666
There's nothing here.

16
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.300
It's not fun.

17
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.166
Third brother why father emperor

18
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.466
It's so different from us and big brother

19
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.200
I also want to be touched on the head

20
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.066
I want to eat candied haws too

21
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.900
If you want to eat, the third brother will buy it for you

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.633
What's there to be envious of?

23
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.400
Third brother, why don't you eat candied gourds?

24
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.700
What's so delicious about candied haws?

25
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.833
The thing I hate the most is candied haws.

26
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.400
It's not that good.

27
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.633
A little sour

28
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.933
But I see that the big brother eats well

29
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:51.633
Will the candied gourd given by Father Emperor taste better?

30
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.733
Remember at night

31
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.866
Don't get what you can't get

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.433
Don't ask for what you can't get

33
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.466
It won't be sad.

34
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm actually feeling wronged to lose

35
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.566
Never got it

36
00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.366
What to talk about losing

37
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.600
late at night

38
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:21.966
at night

39
00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.033
It's all here.

40
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.500
Really dying
