00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.600
How could that be?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.060
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.400
I don't have any flowers.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.740
I don't have any flowers.

5
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.340
Get out of here.

6
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.220
You're filthy.

7
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.600
Your Majesty Shou Hua suddenly entered the palace

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.840
Didn't go through my mother's physical exam.

9
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.840
On the contrary, he directly serves the emperor.

10
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.880
People have many strange diseases.

11
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.260
Your venereal disease is afraid that it was infected before entering the palace.

12
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.060
Bao Chau must not talk nonsense.

13
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.920
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

14
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.540
I am innocent, Your Majesty.

15
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
The owner is clearly not talking nonsense.

16
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.540
His Majesty Zhao Hua is the noble lady Yao brought into the palace.

17
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.660
Princess

18
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.340
Why did you bring this filthy woman to my dragon bed?

19
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.380
The emperor is guilty.

20
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.280
Your Majesty, I also used this high-temperature flask to remove your cult.

21
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.420
But I still recommend that you look for Thai y Choi.

22
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.780
Don't worry.

23
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260
Princess, please wake up.

24
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.740
I blame you.

25
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.420
You're pregnant.

26
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.540
I always care about my body.

27
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.620
Come here, chaplain.

28
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.400
Yang Lihua, if it's because you have Willow's disease,

29
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.440
It will definitely tear you to pieces.

30
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.860
Your Majesty doesn't need it.

31
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.232
Your Majesty doesn't need it.

32
00:01:32.232 --> 00:01:33.780
And you.

33
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.620
Your Majesty.

34
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.500
The Queen

35
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.900
I'm not sick. 

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.380
I'm really not sick.

37
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.940
Don't touch this shit.

38
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.860
Ms. Yao

39
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.900
Cousin.

40
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.660
Just kneel here and wait for the letter.

41
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.880
Four Hy

42
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.060
I know who you are.
