00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.940
I want to ask you to kill me.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.260
Kill what?

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.340
Who do you want to kill?

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.580
I haven't even thought about it.

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.980
Your Majesty, don't blame me for being cruel.

6
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.020
I have no mother's house.

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.100
You can only rely on this method to scare those bad guys.

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.980
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.740
I want to kill the damn man who works for the tiger.

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.432
Okay.

11
00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:38.200
You can't be soft-hearted after this.

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.000
I...

13
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.380
It gives you the right to kill.

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.099
Didn't take it.

16
00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.333
Go. 

17
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.199
The two ladies invited.

18
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.366
Master

19
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:11.140
It's been half a month, and the emperor didn't say to lift your detention.

20
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.833
Princess

21
00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:13.180
Oh.

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.100
The princess has been released.

23
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.780
A long time ago, the North Dai general of the town was instrumental in fighting piracy.

24
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.060
Your Majesty will naturally give the North General some thin face.

25
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.260
Let the princess go.

26
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.820
But you're the Queen Mother's niece.

27
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.333
Is the Queen in the palace now?

28
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:29.620
This one.

29
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.740
Queen Mother Prays at Long Tuong Temple

30
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.620
The old man talked a lot.

31
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.940
I don t even know what the first one is.

32
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.560
Everywhere against the palace.

33
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.220
What connection could there be?

34
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.300
It's just a little sparrow who wants to be a phoenix.

35
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.340
She didn't want to please the emperor.

36
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.060
What are you doing here?

37
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.940
Looking for the alliance's sister?

38
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.980
My sister remembers.

39
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.340
Your Majesty gave Miao Tzu the authority to kill.

40
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.020
If that bitch doesn't kill you, she'll kill me.

41
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.380
Let's get together soon.

42
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.100
Deal with her.

43
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.900
Deal with the most beloved wife of the saint today.

44
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.500
It's not easy.

45
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.500
My sister remembers.

46
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.740
Half a month ago the emperor called Miao Tu Hy something

47
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.640
If there is no Jubilee here

48
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.300
I will die at the hands of these two men.

49
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.860
Hi.

50
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.632
Hi.

51
00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:37.966
The late queen's granddaughter is also known as Jubilee.

52
00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:38.620
not odd
