1
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.733
Sister.

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.800
Why did you kill me?

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.840
The palace is not there.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.980
It's not me.

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.080
Hi.

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.700
General.

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.500
This is your good sister.

8
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.080
It's cruel and cruel

9
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.060
How to do it later

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.633
That year you for favor

11
00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:28.540
When you despise human life, you must have thought of the end like today.

12
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.980
Sister, how could you take such a risk?

13
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.766
This is coming soon.

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.340
That's it.

15
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.333
brother

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:35.633
Hey.

17
00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:37.720
Don't you trust me too?

18
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.860
Apparently someone just pushed me a little.

19
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.380
That knife didn't hurt anything.

20
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.380
Why is there so much blood?

21
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.100
This time

22
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.100
You keep an eye on this bastard for me.

23
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.580
Go throw away this sheepskin bag.

24
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.099
It's the owner.

25
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.900
Your Majesty is coming.

26
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.099
Sit.

27
00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.633
Your Majesty.

28
00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:15.680
You're here.

29
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.220
Jubilee, sit down.

30
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.599
Dr. Choi gave Jubilee an angiogram.

31
00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.860
Yes.

32
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.540
Jubilee was injured in the abdomen.

33
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.540
You can get pregnant for a long time.

34
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.660
It's dry.

35
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.780
Watch the candles.

36
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.280
The owner told me to keep an eye on my wife.

37
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.840
But this month is over.

38
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.820
Still no wind blowing the grass.

39
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.600
The Emperor is not coming tonight.

40
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.640
The owner slept earlier.

41
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.266
You and I are going to rest too.

42
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:06.500
Yes.

43
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.860
Oh, you're hurting me.

44
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.020
The happy wife is doing good things.

45
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.740
Your Majesty is not here.

46
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.220
Who's that man?

47
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200
frequency range

48
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.180
Stealing and Flirting
