1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.940
Your Majesty doesn't need it.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.940
Unless you can restore the truce.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.660
Otherwise, death is difficult to escape.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.400
She doesn't have this ability.

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.980
Let's do it.

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.060
Recovery I can recover

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.900
Your Majesty, I can restore this armistice.

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.666
Death, please believe me.

9
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.220
Bold apples

10
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.140
Your Majesty's name is that you can be honest.

11
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.220
Slow down, she called my name.

12
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.533
That year only my queen was me.

13
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.020
Hello wife.

14
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.320
How can you fix this truce?

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.220
Your Majesty.

16
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.500
Don't listen to her.

17
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.000
The ceasefire has been destroyed, how can it be restored?

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's clear that Jubilee's wife did something wrong.

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.340
Afraid of death again.

20
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.820
If she can restore the truce,

21
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.360
I'm ready to cut off my head.

22
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.932
Hanging on the wall

23
00:00:52.932 --> 00:00:53.540
sister

24
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.420
Your Majesty, please blow your breath.
