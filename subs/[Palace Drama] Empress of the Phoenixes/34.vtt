00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.260
Fuck you too.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.860
The public was poisoned.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.499
That's right.

4
00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.720
Dr. Choi has put chronic toxins into your ylang pollen.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.180
You poisoned me with that doctor.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.800
I want to see the Emperor.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.280
I want to see the Emperor.

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.132
Your Majesty.

9
00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:24.600
The Queen

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.300
The king does not want to see you now.

11
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.566
He hates you.

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.060
Disgusting.

13
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.220
There is no way that the emperor can please me.

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.200
Love me

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.260
Haha.

16
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.880
Your grace.

17
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.333
Love you.

18
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.280
It's all for the Northern General to see.

19
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.420
Do you see what's in this perfume bag?

20
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.599
They're all birth control pills.

21
00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:48.540
Oral contraceptives

22
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.820
It's because of these things that you shut up. 

23
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.980
You're pregnant with that nerd who's not a man or a woman.

24
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.860
How could Your Majesty do that to me?

25
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.540
You want that cruel angel.

26
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.380
How's it going?

27
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.999
In addition

28
00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.140
You do a lot of bad things.

29
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.060
Death is not a pity.

30
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.020
Ha ha ha ha ha

31
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.580
Master, why did the emperor come?

32
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.460
The North Korean general took military power.

33
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.700
Your Majesty must be under the pressure of General Zhen Bac.

34
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.780
So you decided you wanted to forgive that woman?

35
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.860
Do you know wrong?

36
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.860
Your Majesty, you're here.

37
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.520
You're still coming to visit me.

38
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.260
Our child.

39
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.380
Our child is gone.

40
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.300
Don't tell me about that monster.

41
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.140
If you really know wrong

42
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.820
I can see it on General Zhen Bac's face.

43
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.066
Let you go.

44
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.420
Let me out.

45
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.140
When will you forgive me for my brother?

46
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.960
It's all because of you.

47
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.980
Our children turn into monsters.

48
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.466
I hate you.

49
00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:18.220
You already know

50
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.033
What are you doing?

51
00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:22.940
I want you.

52
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420
And our child.

53
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.980
Getting married in hell.

54
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.680
What are you doing?

55
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.800
Let me go, you idiot.

56
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.980
Help!
