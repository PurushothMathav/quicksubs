00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.866
Phong Tu Hi

2
00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.700
I know who you are.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.760
Yao knows who I am.

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.320
That's great.

5
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.033
From now on, I can avenge you.

6
00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:12.940
Relying only on you.

7
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.740
A woman rises from the palace.

8
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.900
I'm just a humble embroidery girl.

9
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.860
Fight me.

10
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.520
You know the Queen is behind you.

11
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.020
You can't beat me.

12
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.460
Then you can wait and see.

13
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.340
Four Hy Seedlings

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.060
Dr. Choi

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.120
How is the Dragon Body?

16
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.640
Don't worry, Queen.

17
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.460
The Dragon King is okay.

18
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.520
Your Majesty, this card is hanging from my heart.

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.980
Finally put it down.

20
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.220
Dr. Choi has something to say.

21
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.520
The emperor sent someone to examine the body of the noble Zhao Hua.

22
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.199
Found

23
00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.900
What did you find?
