1
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.380
Your Majesty, please.

2
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.540
It's intact.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.780
Jubilee, how did you do that?

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.400
Unbelievably when I was a child my mother taught me folk tricks.

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.300
Now it's useful.

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.066
Cease fire agreement.

7
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:23.880
How's it going?

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.780
General.

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.820
The enemy will attack again.

10
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.420
Recovery

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.200
I met him once in the country.

12
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.380
It is rumored that the woman who restored this art is the hard-to-find thousand-year-old saint.

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.920
What recovery?

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.780
Which saint?

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.060
It's all a game of four.

16
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.680
General.

17
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.840
Go home and practice.

18
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.233
My body is a little tired.

19
00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:49.260
Follow orders

20
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.960
Long day

21
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.260
Don't lose big because you're small.

22
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.440
The Queen

23
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.520
My employer has restored the truce.

24
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.960
Please don't punish her anymore.

25
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.260
Let's see who dares to punish my daughter.

26
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.980
Princess.

27
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.180
The noble words that have been denounced before are still many.

28
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.100
The princess said I should be able to restore this recovery book.

29
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.140
Cut off your own head.

30
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.620
The bow says

31
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.640
Don't you want my life?

32
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.740
Take it.
