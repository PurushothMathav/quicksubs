00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.620
They're all people.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.820
Yao Fei

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.220
This is my gift to you.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.100
Open it up.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.140
There's no general's head.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.740
Thank you for bringing forth evil spirits.

7
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.840
You promised the lady you're welcome.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.200
Our leader has spoken.

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.100
Compared to getting a bride

10
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.060
Or is it a Turkish party exemption?

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.980
Paying taxes every year is more important.

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.860
Yao Fei, can you hear me?

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.600
Instructions for use

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.740
Hello, there is a medium.

15
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.020
Duke Su

16
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.260
Slaves are here.

17
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.660
The emperor is dead.

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.460
Your Majesty is frozen.

19
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.980
Did the emperor leave a photo?

20
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.160
Your Highness, the Emperor did not leave a photograph.

21
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.820
But the queen left her mouth wanting

22
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.780
What did the Queen say?

23
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.740
The Queen Mother said to let Lady Yao become the master of the Green Palace.

24
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.140
Wasn't the Empress Dowager killed by Yao Fei's mother?

25
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.080
The emperor is dead.

26
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.940
Currently, no one can prevent you from becoming the owner of the house.

27
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.560
You are now one level higher than you.

28
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.860
If you want the bow to keep you alive.

29
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.620
Take your son to me.

30
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.780
Yao, have you forgotten anything?
