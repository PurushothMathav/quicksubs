1
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.640
The first is a slave and the second is a woman.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.960
Just have fun.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.260
I pray for the Lord to go up to the mountain and to the sea of fire.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.500
Not just smart.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.660
It's a loyal dog.

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.420
Then you will stay with the Lord.

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.980
The Queen

8
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.700
Be careful being fooled by that Princess Yao.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.260
You said she's Yao Fenglian's girl.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.260
Please raise your head for me to see.

11
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.460
He looks handsome.

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.580
I just don't know.

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.620
The bow cuts a knife here.

14
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.580
Brother Sister

15
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.680
What system

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.700
Go away.

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.220
Yes.

18
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.266
I saw my sister from a distance.

19
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.740
Teach this little girl.

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.980
So come see if there's anything you can do for my sister.

21
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.340
Ms. Yao

22
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.740
The palace has stolen your beloved.

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.740
This streamer dress

24
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.740
Aren't you designed to burn?

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.100
What burns?

26
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.260
Read poetry books

27
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.780
Especially not seeing these dirty tricks.

28
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.500
Still pretending.

29
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.820
Look at these clothes.

30
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.300
After that little maid turned decay into magic

31
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.420
The bow now wants to wear this streamer dress.

32
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.300
Go with the emperor to see the moon.

33
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.100
I'm afraid I haven't seen the Emperor in half a month.

34
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.460
Goodbye.

35
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.220
Go.

36
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.900
Why didn't you send someone to arrest me?
