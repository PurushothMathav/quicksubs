1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.940
Your Majesty.

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.100
Your Majesty.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.220
Princess, why did you beat the emperor?

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.700
How dare you?

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.860
You can play.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.820
Have you changed men?

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.420
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.100
I always serve by your side.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.420
Jubilee doesn't need an explanation.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.660
Princess, I think you're crazy.

11
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.166
I see your majesty.

12
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.380
The Queen

13
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.766
The Queen

14
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.420
It's him.

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.460
Your Majesty, that man is this dog doctor.

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.433
The Queen

17
00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.140
How can I have an affair with my concubine?

18
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.340
Rose, did you say the man you saw was him?

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.140
Hong, have you seen the man wearing this dress?

20
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.060
It's this dress, that man is me.

21
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.020
How is that possible?

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.620
Why is Your Majesty wearing Thai clothes?

23
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.940
I don't know.

24
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.300
This is how God thought half a month ago for the emperor and lady.

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.500
But...

26
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.900
It's the joy of boudoir.

27
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.860
Help the Queen get pregnant

28
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.620
Sister, why are you targeting me everywhere?

29
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.820
Bitch.

30
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.299
Dare you calculate the bow?

31
00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:38.860
Princess

32
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.380
You accused Jubilee of slander.

33
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.840
You hit me with a stick.

34
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.300
Offenses against scales

35
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.340
Add sin to sin

36
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.180
The man who came to drag the princess out struck 50 grand.

37
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.499
Your Majesty.

38
00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:54.140
No, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.020
Your Majesty, the Queen is too scared to faint.

40
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.900
Take this poisonous woman back to the Wisdom Palace.

41
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.233
This Princess.

42
00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:18.380
Send it yourself.

43
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.180
After all, General Zhenbei is her brother.

44
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.180
Let the gods out of your mind.

45
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.700
Rarely does Jubilee have such a delicate heart.

46
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.300
How do I not love you

47
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.920
Out of the way!

48
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.233
Master

49
00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:50.900
Why did you push the emperor for the princess?

50
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.099
This is called

51
00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.980
Lead the enemy into the cave.

52
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.780
Lead the enemy into the cave.
