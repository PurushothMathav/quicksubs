1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.766
Master

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.140
Are you there?

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.060
You are not a princess.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.380
The owner is not in the bedroom.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.660
Young master, do you know where this is?

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.233
My little eunuch.

7
00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:24.940
Lower your voice.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.740
This elegant fragrance is charming.

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.660
Little Tai Lin, do you know that the princess Phan next to the noble lady Mi is very scary?

10
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.199
If he knows you've broken in

11
00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:40.120
The Queen's Bedroom

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.300
You'll end up like me.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.940
What's your end?

14
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.460
Phan beat or scolded our women.

15
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.660
This is Pandehai.

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.300
Pandehai, it's your turn to thank my mother.

17
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.500
This slave dog is brave.

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.780
I'll master it for you.

19
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.600
You are not a saint today.

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.100
Why can you own me?

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.800
The queens are coming.

22
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.580
Go.

23
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.100
Who are you?

24
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.220
I...

25
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.420
Gotta find you

26
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.580
Your Majesty has been waiting.

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.540
I suddenly came to sunflower perfume

28
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.960
Princess

29
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.660
Keep your eyes wide open.

30
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.880
Who was the one who made the emperor linger about after all?

31
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.340
You let me be kind

32
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.580
Now we're talking about sunflower perfume.

33
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.300
You're kidding me.

34
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.100
Your Majesty forgives.

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.580
Phan beat or scolded our women.

36
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.900
Forgive.

37
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.420
The Pande Sea

38
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.980
What is your queen guilty of?

39
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.260
The body is Kun Ninh Cung leader Thai Lam

40
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.799
You don't do reminder duty.

41
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.080
The owner's words and actions

42
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.620
You don't even know where she's wrong.

43
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.460
It's worth dying for.

44
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.533
Xiao Su Tu

45
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:09.866
Yes.

46
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:10.500
Take it.

47
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.200
Haha queen

48
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.780
Queen, save me!

49
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.500
Queen, save me!

50
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.280
At the emperor's birthday party, he was still very kind to me.

51
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.860
Why did you suddenly change your face?

52
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.760
From now on, find me this beautiful blue shirt.

53
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.199
I want to make you a lady.

54
00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.580
Slaves obey orders

55
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.020
It is only close to imperial power that there is imperial power.

56
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.740
What blue beauty?

57
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.660
What is noble

58
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.760
Then it is you.
