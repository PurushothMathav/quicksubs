1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.260
General.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.700
This is so serious.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.340
Your Majesty, this is really a truce book.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.060
In the armistice book, the emperor says

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.220
Say what?

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.699
Tell me.

7
00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.900
If the ceasefire is destroyed, that means we don't agree.

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.020
The border is at war again.

9
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.460
Using a woman's life.

10
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.700
In exchange for the lives of millions of my soldiers.

11
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.266
You're not losing.

12
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.740
Yes, Your Majesty.

13
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.900
You can't have a loving wife.

14
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.580
It chilled the hearts of the soldiers.

15
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.140
Get the wine.

16
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.833
Your Majesty.

17
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:42.700
Hello wife.

18
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.420
Drink up.

19
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.660
Let's go.
