00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.020
How dare you poison me?

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.520
The vase owner is angry, this is red pollen.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.480
Non-toxic harmless

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.320
Has a moisturizing and beauty effect on the skin

5
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.580
You're talking nonsense, it's obviously sulfur powder.

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.260
You don't want to trap me.

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.560
Choi's mother, why did you set me up?

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.420
Is it because I know that you are close to me?

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.280
You want revenge for your daughter?

10
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.220
Revenge

11
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.620
Not the owner.

12
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.880
This has nothing to do with slavery.

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.766
It's this.

14
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.100
Her mother actually is...

15
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.666
Ah.

16
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.140
Why is this powder still on me?

17
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.180
The evidence is clear.

18
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.832
The one who wants to harm you is you.

19
00:00:44.832 --> 00:00:45.540
The Pande Sea

20
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.260
The queen is indeed sulfur powder.

21
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.132
a year ago

22
00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:57.620
In our palace, there is indeed a woman named Choi who is dead.

23
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.599
This slave comes close to you.

24
00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:01.733
Of course there's another plan.

25
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.940
The Queen

26
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.333
I want to hurt you, Lord.

27
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:05.740
The Queen

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.340
Phan Hai Ham

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.680
Cut out this poisonous woman's tongue for me and throw it out.

30
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.032
Yes.

31
00:01:11.032 --> 00:01:14.780
Lady Lady Lady Lady Lady Lady Lady

32
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.260
It's like entering the palace.

33
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.100
Be careful.

34
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.740
The three traitors.

35
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.820
Other people

36
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.020
Dear.

37
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.399
The Love 

38
00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.620


39
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.766
Mom.

40
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:37.060
I hope your prophecy doesn't come true.

41
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.900
Invite the owner to shower.

42
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.633
Give me the water temperature.

43
00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:45.980
Yes.

44
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.580
Suitable water temperature
