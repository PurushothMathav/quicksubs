00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.140
Now I'm like an ant

2
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.340
But soon you will be attacked by ants.

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.740
The skin can break.

4
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.100
Color white red

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.220
Bathing this red pollen

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.220
It really works wonders.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.580
I'll replace Choi's mother later.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.980
Serve me.

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.660
Thank you, Master.

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.180
Does the bow look any different?

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.140
The Queen is more beautiful after the shower

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.300
Attractive.

13
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.100
Go, Your Majesty.

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.420
Someone has been invited.

15
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.232
Master, these are the ladies.

16
00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:03.660
A gift for you

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.560
The servant chooses the best treasure.

18
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.699
Look at that.

19
00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:10.560
These snobs.

20
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.580
This is knowing that the noble Yao is not favored.

21
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.900
They all came to make friends with the palace.

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.099
Reward you.

23
00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.060
Thank you

24
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.820
Please have some tea.

25
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.880
You have just showered with red pollen that can only moisturize the skin from the outside.

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.020
And this red flower tea can help you adjust from the inside.

27
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.340
The Queen drinks too much.

28
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.033
Why?

29
00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:55.320
Why drink a lot

30
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.660
Although it can make you more radiant in a short time.

31
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.340
But can lead to sunflower perfume a few days earlier.

32
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.540
Just serve your majesty well tonight.

33
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.620
It's not going to make him stay.

34
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.140
Your Majesty is coming.

35
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.140
Honey, this is a birthday party joke with me.

36
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.780
I'm going to comfort her.

37
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.920
The princess calmed down.

38
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.300
Whatever you want, I will reward you.

39
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.620
Who are you?
