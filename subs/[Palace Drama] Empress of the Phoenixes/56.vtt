00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.380
How could she be a queen?

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.240
Right.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.420
Mom, Mom, wake up.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.800
He's out of breath.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.800
Mom, don't leave the Onion.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.660
Mom.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.660
Are you going to kill the Queen?

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.266
Doctor

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:22.632
Right.

10
00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:23.566
It's not.

11
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.160
Sir.

12
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.200
Lovers don't kill people.

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.880
Your wife is my aunt.

14
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.832
I don't kill people.

15
00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:29.180
Princess

16
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.500
Yao Fei, you are a bad person.

17
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.366
Sir.

18
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.180
I didn't kill anyone.

19
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.920
That's Yang Lihua.

20
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.466
That's her.

21
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.280
That's her.

22
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.720
She called the four horses to the cake.

23
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.640
She did that.

24
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.799
It's a dead woman.

25
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:41.260
Sir.

26
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.333
No, Your Majesty.

27
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.220
It's not me.

28
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.000
That's Princess Yao, that's Princess Yao.

29
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.266
That's Yao Fei, you're a bad person.

30
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.660
Dare to slander the bow

31
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.380
You killed my aunt.

32
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.140
I want to protect my aunt.

33
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.099
Don't. 

34
00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.266
Bad guy.

35
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.180
Bad guy.

36
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.780
Normal is not good.

37
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.020
You must die in this blood.

38
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.266
The lover killed this evil man.

39
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.332
I killed her.

40
00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:05.740
Princess

41
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.700
He was the one who brought Yang Lihua into the palace.

42
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.180
She's responsible for what she did.

43
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.580
Remember that you had the grace to save my life.

44
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.700
One of the people who brought the Princess to the palace discovered.

45
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.700
This life will not meet again.

46
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.140
No, no.

47
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.220
You don't need me.

48
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.300
This is the whole harem.

49
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.066
Except for me, no one loves me.

50
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:26.366
My cubine.

51
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.080
 I don't want to except you.

52
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.940


53
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.520
All the people who love me.

54
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.740
Ma'am, I don't want to see you.

55
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.000
Ma'am, I don't just love you.

56
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.833
And you.

57
00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.540
You're the king of the world.

58
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.400
Supported by millions of people.

59
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.040
Ma'am, you're not a princess.

60
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.940
Princess

61
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.460
I'll help you.

62
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.160
Innocent.

63
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.240
In here, you can love money and power.

64
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.460
But the feeling at the end can only be nothing.

65
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.880
The princess gave birth to a little prince.

66
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.440
Come on, let's have some fun.

67
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.820
Now these two women are one in the sky and one on the ground.

68
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.020
In the next life, I'll never love you.

69
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.199
Who?

70
00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.660
That's me.
