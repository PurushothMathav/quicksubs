00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.333
one punch

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.200
I was scared.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.600
They can't be scared if they don't want the scene

4
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.366
Did you change your clothes?

5
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.600
I just received the message.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.266
I arrived with an important partner

7
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.300
So pay attention to the image

8
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.100
Then this partner is very important to you.

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.733
Right

10
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.000
He was the first gold producer to propose

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
The little white face who was taken care of did not dare to come to the dinner party

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
Gu Jingxi, forget it if you don't have an invitation letter.

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.466
He also brought his family to rub the dinner party

14
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.266
I really don't know the sky and earth

15
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.866
City No. 1 is divided, right?

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.600
How dare you insult Third Master Shen?

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.766
It seems that my time has run out

18
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.600
This girl

19
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.100
It's hopeless.

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.700
Even the dawn

21
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.966
That shouldn't offend the provincial family

22
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.500
There's a good show to watch

23
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.266
Little white face

24
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.300
Your outfit is not cheap, is it?

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.800
Get your hands off me!

26
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.100
Dare to make trouble here

27
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.933
You know who I am.

28
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.933
This is the person in charge of the Shen family's event

29
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.833
You're just waiting to be kicked out

30
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.633
You are in charge of this event

31
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.566
Then you don't know me?
