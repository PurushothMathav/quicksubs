00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.466
Kiki, I really don't want to divorce you.

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.533
You are so kind to me

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.766
I treat you like this

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.633
Hey, let's remarry

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.200
No wonder I could give such a heavy gift in the first place.

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.500
It turns out that he is the real lady

7
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.766
Impossible my mother said

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.300
My cousin is abroad

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.433
Didn't come back at all

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.800
You think you have climbed Xu Zhi

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.166
Invited a bunch of actors to act with you

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.766
Do you feel attached to the Shen family?

13
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.100
his mother

14
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.500
It's true.

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.500
It's really not Miss Gu's family

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.500
Exactly.

17
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.600
Gu Jinxi is a play directed and acted by himself today

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.833
Why did you marry into the rich family of Shen?

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Rip it

20
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.866
Mom, please help me.

21
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.066
You are the Gu family lighter

22
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.800
You can't even drive me out.

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.566
I'll tell you what.

24
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.366
The Gu family won't let you go

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.666
Who dares to bully my Gu daughter?

26
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.600
Aunt, you don't know me anymore

27
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.766
Jinxi

28
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.466
Why did you come back?

29
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.866
Didn't you tell me that you are probably abroad?

30
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.433
How did that happen?

31
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.766
Have been abroad

32
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.566
She wasn't an aunt then

33
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.166
You sent an email saying that dad is not in good health

34
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.233
I just got back.

35
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.666
Then there was a car accident

36
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.300
He was saved by Yan Haochen

37
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.800
He's not there to save you.
