00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:04.200
Is this the legendary Supreme Black Card?

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.966
Wait a minute, I'll give you permission to insert the card.

3
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.033
That waiter did this to you just now.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.766
Then you're not angry at all?

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.733
I was once held by a loyal friend

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.666
Miss

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:20.000
Hidden identity and married Ye Haochen to find out

8
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.700
Yeah, sure.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.033
Miss

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.166
We will not establish such personnel in the future.

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.966
You look like a lot of married people

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.166
Just get used to it.

13
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.466
Start with knowledge

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.366
Everyone laughed at him for being a piece of crap

15
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.266
poor acid

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.300
Even the person he worked the most for betrayed him

17
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.966
He must be sad.

18
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.466
I can't get it out, you two liars.

19
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.466
Pretend to be a black card with a fake card

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.666
Believe it or not, I'll call the police and arrest you

21
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.800
You see clearly

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.233
The responsibility that can only be opened if the daily flow exceeds 100 million

23
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.166
I don't care what card

24
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.300
It's all fake.

25
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.066
You two poor ghosts, hurry up and leave me

26
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.766
Don't delay our business.

27
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.700
You can't afford to go bankrupt

28
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.400
A mere antique shop

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.500
It's also worthy of making my hands go bankrupt

30
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:02.966
What do you mean?

31
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.800
Who is so unqualified?

32
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.966
Noisy, Miss Ma

33
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:08.866
How do you

34
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.700
These two poor acids

35
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.833
You still have no money to come in and fish in our muddy waters
