00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.566
Hey wait a minute

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.966
I remember Manager Liu said

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.900
He doesn't recognize any daughter at all

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.466
Why is there a daughter's phone number?

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.000
How can a down payment be possible to ride a broken motorcycle?

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.366
He's definitely not the eldest lady

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.166
Must be here to deceive

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.466
Who do I want your phone number from?

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.700
I still need to see you in person

10
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.166
You really don't know

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.133
This lady is tens of millions per minute

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.666
What are you doing?

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.000
Get him out of here

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.100
Don't waste my time

15
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.900
Do you hear me?

16
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.133
Hurry up and try it

17
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.166
Do not touch me

18
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.966
Since you don't believe it

19
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.333
Then call Manager Liu over

20
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.000
Let him tell you who the eldest lady is

21
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.000
Why don't we be careful?

22
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.466
In case you offend the real money Miss Jin

23
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.966
I bought just the smallest apartment

24
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.566
Who should know a big butler like Manager Liu?

25
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.966
Don't you want to do it?

26
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.200
Don't come tomorrow.

27
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.733
Miss, don't be angry

28
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.300
He's a stalker

29
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.333
He is a liar

30
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.766
I don't know any housekeeper Liu at all

31
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.966
Let's continue to watch him pretend

32
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.266
Let's see how he pretends

33
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.266
Song Tiantian, are you guilty?

34
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.400
How is that possible?

35
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.366
I just don't want to waste time.

36
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.900
And with your broken mobile phone number, you say it's Manager Liu.

37
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.666
Who knows if you found someone to fake it?

38
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.566
Then at least I can call Manager Liu over

39
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.833
How can you prove your identity?

40
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.833
Do not parse

41
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.600
You really don't cry when you see the coffin?

42
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.300
I said I'm the real lady

43
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.266
I have the real estate certificate of Kangchen Yipin

44
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.866
How about you? Do you have any?

45
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:29.700
Limit you to 3 minutes

46
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.533
Put all the real estate certificates of Kangcheng Yipin

47
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.600
Bring it to me.
