00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.433
Are you blind?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.166
Song Tiantian is a liar

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.200
He said he was a gold producer.

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.500
Why prove it?

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Ye Haochen, don't take you blind, look at me

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.966
My ability I understand is your wisdom

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.433
It's useless to talk too much

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.333
Since there is such a dispute

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.400
Then let's take the dawn

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.633
The best music works

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.066
What do you mean?

12
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.966
Chenxi used to be dedicated to Qi

13
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.333
Tree Media did a song

14
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.466
We play separately

15
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.600
It's your decision.

16
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.400
Push in

17
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.700
It's over, this must be a master's work

18
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.800
Look at the entire entertainment industry and music industry

19
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.633
Only the dawn can make it

20
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:55.700
I feel ashamed

21
00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.500
You praise him so much

22
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.833
Do you want to prove that the Shen family still has room to fight back?

23
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.100
Miss Gu

24
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.000
This is indeed God

25
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.066
I can't lie out of conscience, can I?

26
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:08.633
Let me down

27
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.600
Dawn

28
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.300
Must be dawn

29
00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.566
If not, it must be the odd number one personality in the future

30
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.300
I am your subordinate Vientiane

31
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.800
How could Lihan Prefecture cooperate so much?

32
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.666
So the Shen family still has room for backhand

33
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.833
Then Miss Gu, he and I are just an alien illegitimate

34
00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:29.066
But Han also stole it from his uncle for his cousin

35
00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:31.366
I absolutely can't put this money in

36
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.400
I only gamble with Shen Yanzhen and Gu Jinxi

37
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.466
Gu Jinxi, do you dare?

38
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:40.100
I'll bet you.

39
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.300
Your chips

40
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.966
Don't tell me you have a penny all over you

41
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.000
I'll take it then.

42
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.933
10% of Yuncheng Story Branch is your responsibility

43
00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:52.733
How did it go?

44
00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:56.500
Equity in your story

45
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.433
Are you confused?

46
00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.333
The whole story is mine

47
00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:01.266
Let alone a branch office

48
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.066
That bone

49
00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:04.066
What's the matter? Don't be afraid.
