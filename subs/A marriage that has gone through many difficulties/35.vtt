00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.466
How did he know I wasn't buying a mountain?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.133
Top cloud spring

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.000
What about the villa?

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.266
The entire Yuncheng

5
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.700
The most expensive Genting Villa belongs to my family

6
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.766
You sell songs by setting up a stall

7
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.500
It's your own home to blow to Genting Villa alone

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.566
So ashamed

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.566
Mr. Yu, how dare you

10
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.200
Admit that you didn't buy Genting Villa on the top of the mountain?

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.500
Yes I admit

12
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.933
I bought the villa below Genting Villa

13
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.533
I really want to buy the top one too

14
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.066
But the person in charge told me

15
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.300
Not for sale without the permission of the eldest lady

16
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.666
I'm going to have to settle for the next best thing.

17
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.433
He guessed it all

18
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.666
It seems that Mr. Yu

19
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.100
What you bought is really not the Genting Villa on the top of the mountain.

20
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.333
What is this woman's background?

21
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.566
Even know this

22
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.366
Mr. Yu is quite honest

23
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.533
I didn't buy Genting Villa with a fountain.

24
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.233
But you can't lie, Miss Dawn

25
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.800
Say the whole Genting Villa is your own

26
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.900
Mr. Yu is right

27
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.700
Compared to the top of the mountain and the side of the mountain

28
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.766
The price difference is more than ten times.

29
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.533
Who has so much money to buy a villa?

30
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.900
This was mine

31
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.700
But who is serious soon?

32
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.266
The rain is blowing so hard

33
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.766
How do you want me to end?

34
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:03.700
Don't worry.

35
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.266
The real estate certificate for Genting Villa on the top of the mountain is coming

36
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.500
Gu Jinxi, you are a singer

37
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.500
Third Master Shen was sent in the name of Chenxi

38
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.866
Not only discontent

39
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.066
Shameless to say

40
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.400
Genting Villa is your own home

41
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.566
Want me to say

42
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.466
You can't afford one in your life

43
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.133
I, Mrs. Shen Yanzhen

44
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.700
There's nothing you can't afford.

45
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.866
Jin Xian and

46
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:27.566
Give in to the boss

47
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.466
Give you some gifts that are not salty or light.

48
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:32.000
Why don't I give you a real gift?

49
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:36.433
I will give you 50% of the shares of the Shen family

50
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.466
Shen Yanzhen, you are presumptuous
