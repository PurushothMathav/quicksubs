00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.366
You won't forget

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.300
You installed a smart home, right?

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.000
I try so much every day I always remember this

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.866
Besides, how do I know what it is?

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:13.166
On weekdays, I fly all over the world

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.000
They're all luxury hotels.

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.966
I forgot what a house is like in general

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.766
Oh, is that so?

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.000
I live in Genting Villa

10
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.800
Naturally not that familiar with this place

11
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.466
Genting Villa

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.100
Is that the most famous hot spring villa in Yuncheng?

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.966
It is said that the four seasons are like spring there

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.900
Spring water can also beauty and beauty

15
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.900
You poor lady kindly let you in and have a look

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.000
You just hit a switch.

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.466
It really got you installed

18
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.533
Forget it, you bumpkin

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.700
It's a waste of my time to argue with him

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.600
It seems that I won't tear off your mask.

21
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
You're not going to admit you're a liar.

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.100
Come with me

23
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.400
This is the eldest lady's cloakroom

24
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.600
If you are the eldest lady

25
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600
Do you know what's in it?

26
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.333
How did you know this was a cloakroom?

27
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.933
It must be a guess

28
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.200
Miss, I will no longer question you.

29
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.766
You must really protect the daughter

30
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.866
Well, you still have a good eye.

31
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.166
I have houses all over the country

32
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.366
It's a cloakroom.

33
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.500
I've always wanted to go in

34
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.466
I don't remember. Yes.

35
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.266
But you won't forget

36
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.166
Did someone just put something in it?

37
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.600
Then you talk first

38
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.066
What did you have someone put in it before you came?

39
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.133
Don't say I'm lucky when I open it

40
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.533
Isn't that nonsense?

41
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.633
Don't you keep clothes and jewelry in the cloakroom?

42
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.966
Count your broken motorcycle

43
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.100
It's not really my motorcycle

44
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.966
You look guilty

45
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.100
You don't know what's in it.

46
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.800
Put it here

47
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.866
It's my dress from childhood to adulthood

48
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:50.033
And various trophies
