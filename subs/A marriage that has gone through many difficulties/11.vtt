00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.533
The evidence is all here

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.300
Song Tiantian, what else do you have to say?

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.366
These certificates are fake

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.566
You dare to pretend to be a down payment daughter

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.700
Find a few actors to do a few fake certificates

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.600
Is it not for you to count in your heart?

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.300
Song Tiantian, you really don't cry when you see the coffin?

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.200
What if I said

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.700
I can open the most luxurious center of Kangchen Yipin

10
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.666
The door of that house

11
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.500
It was the finest building in Yuncheng

12
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.766
But it's right to prepare for the down payment

13
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.633
That's the one.

14
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.666
How can I open the best single-family building?

15
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.366
No, we have to get him out quickly

16
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.633
He is a liar

17
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.033
These certificates are fake

18
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.433
Throw him out now

19
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.666
Yeah, wait a minute, isn't it just a lock?

20
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.333
Song Tingting

21
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.400
Do you know you can't open it?

22
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.600
Why can't the hard work be opened?

23
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.433
I just don't want to waste my time

24
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.966
Isn't it just a password?

25
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:42.866
Just go

26
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.066
You can go now.

27
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.366
Hey Song Tiantian

28
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.733
You wouldn't have told me

29
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.000
You can't even get in your own door, can you?

30
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.800
What are you shouting for?

31
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.966
If you have the ability, go ahead and drive it.

32
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:01.400
Miss

33
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.200
But I forgot what are you so proud of here?

34
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.200
That's it, didn't you find it? What are you urging?

35
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.700
You can forget your own password

36
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.266
You see you still believe

37
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.100
I just have too many houses.

38
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.866
I forgot what the password is.

39
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.466
Don't rush it

40
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.766
Don't worry.

41
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.100
You are great, you know the password

42
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.366
I do know, hey, you're dead

43
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.066
If you want to be proud, just drive it.

44
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.700
You obviously don't know

45
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.266
Stop flipping through your phone, it's almost smoking from you

46
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.766
What are you yelling at?

47
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.466
Miss won't forget the password

48
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.400
Could it be that he knows about your fake certificate?

49
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.800
I really didn't turn it on

50
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000
Hey

51
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.700
Who says I can't open it?

52
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.500
Dad, didn't you mean Kang Zheng?

53
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.166
Yipin's best active villa

54
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.500
It's you who patrol every day

55
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:57.866
Tell me the password

56
00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.800
he
