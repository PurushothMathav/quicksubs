00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.566
Mr. Chen, please let our Qiao family go

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.100
As long as you are willing to raise your hand

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.500
Old man, this life is yours

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.666
You all keep your mouth shut

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.233
Do you love it?

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.566
Stop fucking with my brother

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.900
Xiao Bu, you saw it too

8
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.433
They see

9
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.700
Against me

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.300
That is against you

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.966
Against you

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.100
That is to go against Mr. Shen

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.833
In my opinion, it is better to take them from Jiangdong to each other

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.266
That can't be done.

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.666
Xiaobu

16
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.800
How's business?

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.000
Drink tea and have a gun

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.600
Isn't it just a word from you?

19
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.333
Mr. Xiao Shen, the thing that offended you

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.800
It has nothing to do with us

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600
It's all done by Lin Fan

22
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.833
What Lin Fan

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.200
Mr. Shen

24
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.566
Mr. Shen

25
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.066
I don't know if it's a year

26
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.366
Please forgive me.

27
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.466
It's not New Year's Eve for Mr. Shen

28
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.633
Why bother with this gift?

29
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.166
My Identity

30
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.066
Don't let anyone know

31
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.100
Think clearly

32
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.066
wavelet

33
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.466
What are you doing?

34
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.700
Yuyang Xianye

35
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.600
Did you call Xiaobo?

36
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
Mr. Shen

37
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.200
Good Mr. Shen

38
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.100
This is today

39
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.266
Don't you see I'm busy?

40
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.266
I'll settle the bill with you later.

41
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:31.066
I took green medicine, this is Miss Qiao

42
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.766
This is the 300 million contract given to you by Shen's Group.

43
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.100
Please be sure to accept it

44
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.233
What 300 million?

45
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.133
God, I'm not dreaming, am I?

46
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.300
Things are changing so fast

47
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.366
300 million for me

48
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.200
Did Mr. Shen make a mistake?
