00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.666
Long Night

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.200
Cover the world

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:10.200
And the creed is the light from the new world

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.766
Only blood can wash it all away

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:20.000
Only blood can open the door to a new world

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.600
But if so

7
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.366
How many innocent people are killed indiscriminately?

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.566
Hahaha it's over

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.900
I will no longer persuade you to be stubborn

10
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.800
The world is waiting for the arrival of the new world

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.366
Look at those corrupt officials drinking and having fun

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.300
People in the slums

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.633
How miserable they are

14
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.966
Only take up the sickle in your hand

15
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.066
Stir up a storm

16
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.633
To rid the world of all evil

17
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.066
So

18
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.766
You let Gwaner stir up the world's disputes

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.266
But for your evil new world

20
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.700
Too bad your plan fell through again

21
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.766
Lin Fan

22
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.666
Your soul has been dirty for a long time

23
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.333
Unfortunately, there is no cure

24
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.200
There are so many ways to save people in the early morning

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.300
But definitely not indiscriminate

26
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.566
There would have been nothing new.

27
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.800
Lin Fan, you are wrong.

28
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.900
The new world is coming

29
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.200
True creed

30
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.266
Coming soon.

31
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.100
I wish you forgiveness.

32
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.300
Let your creed lead you to new power.

33
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.400
The night fades away

34
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.133
Glory to letter

35
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.600
Hahaha

36
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.400
Here comes the real creed

37
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.666
Here comes the real creed

38
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:58.400
Hahaha here comes the real creed

39
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.866
It came hahahahahahaha
