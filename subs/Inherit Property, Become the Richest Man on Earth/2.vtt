00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.560
You brought me and this startup meeting, but it's not enough?

2
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.020
Indeed

3
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.010
Mine does have to go.

4
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.070
You completed your last mission well. Isn't this about five million people?

5
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:47.540
Go go shopping by yourself. Don't be bored at home. Thank you.

6
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.980
Don't get it next time

7
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.780
I don't have anyone to play with. I'll play with you as a player.

8
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.550
I don't like to open players

9
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.440
Can give you the meaning of choice

10
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.460
This thing has to go far and far.

11
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.260
OK, go for a walk, go for a long walk

12
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.000
You take our sister and bring the next person

13
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:41.560
Don't look at it, you will only be me in this life, and I can only be suitable for you.

14
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.950
To judge one's career and not return to the past

15
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.380
What the hell is going on here?
