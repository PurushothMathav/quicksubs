00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.940
Miss Ji, these are all the words for another day,

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.060
I hope this helps you remember what happened.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.060
But it only indicates the amount of words, not too many women's hours and photos.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.520
After hearing this, why are there no photos of women?

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.330
I remember that more than ten years ago, the other day, a family had a big business.

6
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.410
Almost everyone in his family died,

7
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.270
Everything that has no solution is burned away.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.780
What? Guess that?

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.580
Big players in the field, applied audio,

10
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.390
I will find a way to have your father someday,

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.440
I will make a comparison with you then. No.

12
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.260
Get paid to do things?

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.240
Don't hold out hope for me or you either.

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.380
The success rate of seeking trust is not high

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.600
Otherwise, it wouldn’t be in the news every time

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.200
And for those who returned to shore to be human beings

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.560
I don’t want to treat him as a life-saver.

18
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.910
I really want to know how worth it

19
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.300
Treat him as if you are alive or not

20
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.160
They all want to find out and come back to me.

21
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.420
But alone

22
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.380
Think again about self-reliance

23
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.760
Arriving at the Three-Body Problem

24
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.620
Been getting back to me thank you
