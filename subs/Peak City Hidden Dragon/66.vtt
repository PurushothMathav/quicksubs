00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.433
Mr. Ye's contract is done

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.666
Go to your ear

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.666
Did you sign it? You know I can't sign it

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.400
Anyway, you are also my underarm blood

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.766
At least call me uncle

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.266
You insist that I kill you

7
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.300
It's your little security guard who has been caught in

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.766
What else do you expect?

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:24.266
Who said I was taken away? Why did you come back?

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.233
Send you to jail?

11
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.866
Yo still graduated and always signed a contract, boy

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.266
You don't know how to write death, do you?

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.766
It doesn't matter if I die or not

14
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.200
Take a look at this

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.100
kid

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.100
How do you know that?

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.266
Hmph, there's nothing in the world I don't know

18
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.600
Boy, you know too much

19
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.666
You can't get out of here today. Kill him

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.400
Who are you trying to kill?
