00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.700
My dad's gone

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
I am solely responsible for the affairs of the company

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.700
Please also help the ministers

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.400
Mr. Ye

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:13.066
I don't know if I should say something.

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.966
You said Mr. Ye

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.700
You've only been the president of a branch

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.266
It's not suitable to be the chairperson of the ruins, right?

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.033
What do you mean?

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.300
I mean your second uncle has been assisting you

11
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.633
I think it would be more appropriate for him to do it

12
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.300
I will continue to let my second uncle help me

13
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:39.233
Mr. Ye, you are just a woman

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.400
But in his early 20s

15
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.800
Serve as chairperson

16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.300
Something is wrong

17
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.600
Mr. Jiang is right

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.033
I support Mr. Qiang's proposal

19
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.166
outrageous

20
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.100
How to say that Mr. Ye is also the daughter of the chairman

21
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.133
We should support

22
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.433
How can you cross the river and demolish the bridge?

23
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.200
you

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.866
What are you doing?

25
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.133
Mr. Guo Ye is emotional

26
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.000
influence the meeting

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.933
I'll take him down first

28
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.900
Please continue

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.900
Take this madman down for me
