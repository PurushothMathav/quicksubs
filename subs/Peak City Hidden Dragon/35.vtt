00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.700
Long's brothers are welcome

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.600
Brother Long, do you have any orders?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.733
They these days

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.000
At every turn, the company is forced to sign any illegal contracts

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Forcing people to remove from the shelves and kill people

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.966
What do you say?

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.100
Don't worry, Brother Long.

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.300
I'll settle it for you

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.800
Why did you hear that you are going to touch my friend?

10
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.533
This guy is a security guard.

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.900
How could it be the Asura God of War?

12
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.866
Your friend

13
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.600
Does my friend want you to decide?

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.066
Sorry Shura God of War

15
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.266
I have no eyeballs

16
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.066
I didn't know he was your friend.

17
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.366
I apologize to you.

18
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.333
Asura God of War

19
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.333
You see my mother is still tied up by them

20
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.066
Damn it, don't let the old man go

21
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.600
Go go go go go

22
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.733
Mom, are you okay?

23
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.300
It's okay, don't worry.

24
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.166
No one will bully you again

25
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:43.966
Good idea.

26
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.866
Come on, hit me, kill me

27
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:47.100
No, no, no.

28
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.866
I really didn't know you knew Asura War God

29
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.766
Don't I know Shura warriors?

30
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.666
Civilians deserve to be oppressed by you, right?

31
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.400
No no no no

32
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.200
And you, aren't you going to kill me?

33
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.366
I dare not, aren't you going to rob a woman with me?

34
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.633
And his company

35
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.800
dare not dare

36
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.700
These people who bring disaster to the country and the people know how to deal with it

37
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.766
I will send them all to the dark prison

38
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.666
Never see the light
