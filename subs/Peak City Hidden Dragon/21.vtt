00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.666
Tell me the truth.

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.600
Does my dad have an illegitimate child out there?

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.166
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.066
It's been 10 years since your mother passed away, and your father hasn't remarried

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.900
How can there be an illegitimate child?

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.566
Otherwise, how could he do it for a security guard?

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.100
Cut ties with me

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.966
Your dad got out of the army

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.400
rags to riches

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.333
Standing on top of today's peak

11
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.733
What he did?

12
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.066
Has his own reason

13
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.233
I don't care if he doesn't recognize me, I don't recognize him

14
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.466
Did you know that your dad has advanced lung cancer?

15
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.200
Time is running out

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.466
Pardon me?

17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.166
Dad, what's the matter with you?

18
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.466
I didn't leave. I have a cold.

19
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.600
My dad

20
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.766
Really have to pay it off

21
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.866
So listen to your dad

22
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.166
Just do what he says

23
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.600
Yeah, him!

24
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.500
Oh, I see.

25
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.600
What the hell is that?

26
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.466
He actually asked me to invite a security guard back in person

27
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.566
And I fired it myself

28
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.166
This security guard also defiled me

29
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.900
What are you doing here?
