00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.400
Are you the security guard?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.100
Crazy security

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.266
Talk to me in such a tone

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.500
What are you still standing for?

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.666
He who defies us dies

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.600
It's Jiu Ye Jiu Ye and so on

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.000
He's the son of my nurse

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.933
young and frivolous

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.533
Jiu Ye doesn't want to know you in general

10
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.133
Not allowed

11
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.200
Give all the parts of our Ye family to Jiu Ye

12
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.366
Ask Jiu Ye to let them go

13
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:23.500
Are you really willing to sell shares of Tianqiang Group?

14
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.500
Yes, since you are so sincere

15
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.766
Give you face

16
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.400
You make this security guard kneel on the ground and slap himself

17
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400
Apologize to me.

18
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.933
I will spare his life

19
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.800
My parents never made me kneel

20
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.666
This world is not worth my knees

21
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.233
Are you not worthy of his mother?

22
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.333
Boy, you are courting death

23
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.133
Jiuye Xinuo

24
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.366
I advise you Xiao Luo

25
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.333
You want to see the golden lover

26
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.300
Jiu Ye is the underground emperor of Yunzhou City

27
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.966
As soon as he is angry and greedy, you will take your life

28
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.333
Kowtow dad

29
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.700
Stop begging for him

30
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.633
If he wants to die, let him die

31
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.266
Uncle Lie, don't worry.

32
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.466
When my people come, he will naturally solve it.

33
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.000
What did you call someone?
