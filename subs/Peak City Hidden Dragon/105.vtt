00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.366
Why don't you like it?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.500
No, no.

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.966
I don't know.

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.633
There are many women who like me

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.800
But I always thought I belonged to my country

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.066
Belonging to the battlefield

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.366
But until I see you

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.100
I found that I could still belong to a woman

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.466
Come closer to me

10
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.866
No, I'll just sit here

11
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.033
You know.

12
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.866
I don't like people who are against me

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.266
I'm not against you

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.200
I just haven't thought it through yet.

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.433
Think about it. I adore you.

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.633
I also wanted to be with you

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.233
But what

18
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.666
I'm not ready yet.

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.100
What mental preparation do you need?

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.300
What's going on here?

21
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.400
The Dragon Emperor confessed to me

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.300
Will you marry me

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.566
Why don't I agree?

24
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.366
I heard there are many pictures of me in your bedroom

25
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.400
Yes, the security guard also said

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.466
You still have to tell me not to travel this

27
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.766
Why do you say everything?

28
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.833
