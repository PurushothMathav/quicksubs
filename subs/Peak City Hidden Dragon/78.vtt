00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.733
You may have been stuffed in the sack for a long time.

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.300
I'll try to help you up again.

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.266
Ah no

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.800
I have no strength in my legs at all

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.400
How did that happen?

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.666
I forgot what happened, brother.

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.666
You must have been stuffed in the sack for too long.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.800
Brain nerve damage

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.800
Like paralysis what paralysis

10
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.500
No, I'm still so young.

11
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.200
Never been in love

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.066
How do you survive paralysis?

13
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.933
But I have a way to save you

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.933
Brother, don't comfort me

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.400
How is paralysis treated?

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.500
Believe it or not?

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.666
Don't believe I'm leaving

18
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.200
I believe you go, I'll carry you back

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.466
Thank you brother
