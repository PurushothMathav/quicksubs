00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.666
I'm here none of your business

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.900
Is it okay to shake here?

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.366
Welcome you bastard

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.100
Roll the Big Dipper for me

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.966
Don't talk to Aaron like that, Dad

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.400
Why are you talking like this bastard?

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.333
I told you.

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.000
Don't talk to Aaron like this, Dad

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.933
Aaron hurry into the house

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.033
Your mother and grandmother are still waiting for you

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.866
Aaron is here, sit down

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.400
Ah!

13
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:32.900
What's going on here?

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.700
Aaron

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.433
You listen to me.

16
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.633
They want harmony.

17
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.466
Dansy Marsh

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.633
It's not good for you to keep fighting like this

19
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.033
and

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.433
For your grandmother's sake

21
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.366
Then my dad died in vain

22
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.200
All our years of suffering are in vain, right?

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.400
Ah Long

24
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.700
It's our Dong army

25
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.766
As long as you forgive us

26
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.833
I will definitely compensate you.

27
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.400
You know now you can't hold it

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.200
I told you before.

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.100
Wait for my dad today

30
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.600
It's when your Dong family falls

31
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:05.733
you

32
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.600
Who talks so arrogantly?
