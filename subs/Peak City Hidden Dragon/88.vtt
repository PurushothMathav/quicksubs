00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.000
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Who is this?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.500
Where is the dragon

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.800
He, he, he, he, day shift, brother, call him out

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.900
It's not him, he's the little red man by Mr. Ye's side

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.100
I can't yell at him

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.800
Then call your Mr. Ye

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.866
Said the company was dead

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.100
Humph

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.900
What did you do during the day?

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.166
Take care of something personal, you said you were going to protect me

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.400
But don't run around

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.333
Why do you know now that you want me to protect you?

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.266
Just to protect you don't think too much

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:34.866
Hello

16
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.833
Pardon me?

17
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.033
Who died hello

18
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.266
What's wrong?

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.933
The company security called to say that someone died at the company

20
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.800
If I call again, he won't answer

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.766
Let's go and have a look
