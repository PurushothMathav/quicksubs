00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.766
Hey Chu Long

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.066
You are here too

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.166
how

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.666
You know him?

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.800
Nonsense, can I not know my husband?

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.566
Your husband

7
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.100
And do you have any questions?

8
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.700
The emperor said a few days ago that he would take the princess

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.600
Betrothed to me

10
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.433
What betrothed you

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.033
You are also worthy. Didn't you say you are a concubine?

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.433
They don't recognize you?

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.466
You are not allowed to question what the emperor says

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.700
Dong Ying, right?

15
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.100
Stop dreaming

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.466
The only person I like is Chu Long

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.900
This kid offended my Dong General

18
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.266
I will kill you today

19
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.900
Did you see it?

20
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.166
Supreme Sword

21
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.366
Chop first and then play

22
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.766
It's really majestic

23
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.566
I ask what are you doing here?

24
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.933
Brother Shura asked me to join in the fun

25
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.100
What, you want to help him?

26
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.966
Yes, are you blind?

27
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.500
I didn't see the Supreme Sword in my hand

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.300
Then let me show you something too

29
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.200
You you

30
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.466
How do you have these big fools?

31
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.533
What do you think the fire phoenix will do here?

32
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.433
Waiting for you to throw yourself into the net

33
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.066
Dong Ying, you are ordered to serve your country without fear of diplomacy

34
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.333
Instead, use power for personal gain

35
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.466
Betray national interests

36
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.433
Tell me what to do.

37
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.466
Stay put.

38
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.300
Move again and I'll kill him
