1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.133
He is a former

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.933
Working for Long Shuai

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:05.900
subordinate

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.266
What kind of person could he be?

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.966
The Ye family doesn't care what my identity is

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.866
Anyway, apologize for doing something wrong.

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.466
It's a matter of course

8
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.700
You have to take sides with the wrongdoer.

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.266
Then don't blame me for using extraordinary means

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.500
Apologize for yourself

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Oh, dear.

12
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.233
Night with the wind, you really have more than enough achievements and more than failures

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.266
I'm also counting on you to get Long Shuai's favor

14
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.366
There we go.

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.933
I can't even see him.

16
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.366
Mom, calm down.

17
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.100
I see that 201 will be troublesome in the future.

18
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.533
Since

19
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.800
Our Yan family can't see Long Shuai now

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.000
That's fine, don't come back for the interview

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.566
Anyway, they also led the team to make meritorious contributions, right?

22
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.466
The county seat has no merit

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.000
All the more reason for the parents not to come back

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.766
grandma

25
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.300
I don't think the second uncle's family is suitable for people to come back

26
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.366
Get this family out of here. Hold on

27
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.533
No grandma

28
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.300
You let me think of a way.

29
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.533
I will definitely take you to see Long Shuai

30
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.466
Let's go, let's go, oops

31
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.300
Sin, Jinglong Jingtian at night

32
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.733
You just don't want to make our family feel better

33
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.366
You white-eyed wolf

34
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.366
If you hadn't given birth out of wedlock

35
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
Are we going to be kicked out of the house?
