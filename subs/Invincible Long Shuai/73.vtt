00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.933
You, you, don't be too arrogant

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.266
I am not as strong as you

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.766
Do you dare to compete with me for financial resources?

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.266
Than you think I'm afraid of you

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.366
Not today.

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.333
Our North City

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.766
Except that Long Shuai can match his financial strength

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.666
No one can match his wealth

9
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.400
Humph Ye Fanxin

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.900
It's too late to regret it now

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.466
My husband just gave him a chance to go back on his word

12
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.366
It was he who insisted on comparing his husband

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.100
Then we'll kill him.

14
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.800
This Jing Tian doesn't know you

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.400
I apologize for what happened just now.

16
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.900
Sedum, say sorry

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.866
Ye Fan's new game has started

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.600
But it didn't stop halfway.

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.166
I want to compare with you

20
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.833
See who can afford this 8 million luxury car

21
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:42.933
Do you dare to take the call?

22
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.333
Okay, let's do as you say

23
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.200
Longjingtian

24
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.866
If you can't afford it, you have to kneel and kowtow to me

25
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.733
Knock until I'm satisfied

26
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.533
I have to start being my little brother today

27
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.800
I let you eat pig food, you have to eat it

28
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.366
If I tell you to go east, you can't go west.

29
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.966
No, I can't promise today. Okay.

30
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.466
Also if you can't afford it

31
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.866
Can't afford 8 million

32
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.500
You just get on your knees and crawl out of here

33
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.100
Hahaha don't worry

34
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.600
You're going to lose.
