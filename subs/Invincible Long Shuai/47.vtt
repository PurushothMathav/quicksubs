00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.866
That's right, Longjing Tian

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.000
There is a limit to your madness.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Chu Xiaoxiao

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.500
Did you forget the pain of the slap so soon?

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.700
Do you want me to help you remember you?

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.966
Don't be arrogant

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.200
Would I have been beaten if you hadn't been so powerful?

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.933
Master, I ask you for the last time

9
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.600
If my gift is delivered

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.000
Do you want them to apologize to Fanxing?

11
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.266
No apology

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.100
I will definitely ask Rong Shuai to cancel the opportunity to meet the Ye family

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.266
Bold this bastard

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.966
Talk to the family with a threatening mouth

15
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.366
Wu Huang Long Jing Tian

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.200
I can agree to your request.

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.600
Are you going to be unable to give a gift?

18
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.300
I am willing to leave Ye Fanxin

19
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.533
Never bother him again

20
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.200
It must also be realized by my Ye Jiajia tile

21
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.633
No, I promise.

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.900
One day you will be finished

23
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.266
The family law of our Ye family

24
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.233
You can lie down for half a month at a time

25
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.233
Ten times you are crippled

26
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.733
Sedum, you can't promise

27
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.333
I was just angry because you bragged.

28
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.866
Let's get to this point

29
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.200
But I don't want anything to happen to you.

30
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.466
It's okay, don't worry.

31
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.800
I know you still have me in your heart
