00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.966
What's going on?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.066
Separate immediately

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.533
Xu Zhengyi, just wait and beg on the street

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:10.200
Hahaha, are you still a drama?

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.700
Longjingtian, if you are really so good

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.566
You can make fun of your women and children

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.033
Humiliated for 5 years

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.900
Obviously I can't get along outside

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.866
Just came back to eat soft rice again

10
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.533
Also learn from the overbearing president

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.233
Bankruptcy at every turn

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.100
You don't pee. Take a picture of yourself

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.333
Do you deserve a minute at most?

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.200
I'd like to see if you can still laugh

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.866
Your family didn't provoke you

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.266
Why are you humiliating us?

17
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.166
Mr. Ye Fan

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.200
If it weren't for your appearance

19
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.400
I will be snatched school flower smooth

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.366
I will be your stand-in

21
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.300
I just want to show you today.

22
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.966
How miserable you are

23
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.700
How good I am

24
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.500
Husband, let's go buy a car

25
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.800
Let Ye Fanxing be envious to death

26
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.766
Hurry up and swipe my card to buy this car for me

27
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.566
But

28
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.366
This car has just been bought by Mr. Long

29
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.533
Are you still acting?

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.500
Because I really believed he could afford it

31
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.666
Manager, you ask him to swipe the card.

32
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.100
He doesn't have a dime in his card now.
