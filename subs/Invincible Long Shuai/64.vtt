00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.566
What's the matter, you're still poor, you're not happy anymore

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.900
Look at this dress you're wearing

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.300
Look at that stupid electric bike you're riding

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.200
Am I wrong?

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.933
Bad uncle, our teacher said that you can't judge people by their appearance

6
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:19.266
You can't make fun of others for not having money.

7
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.966
Kid, your teacher, he lied to you.

8
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.466
People like your parents who don't have money

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.100
Deserves to be laughed at

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.766
Don't use your sick three views

11
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.900
To represent everyone

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.966
Yueyue, your teacher didn't lie to you.

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.366
You can't judge people by their appearance

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.066
Just laugh at others for having no money

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.200
This uncle is an uneducated man.

16
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.333
We don't care about him

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.700
You go

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.633
No one in our car is educated

19
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.166
The car in our dealership

20
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.833
They're all million-dollar luxury cars

21
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.666
It would be nice if I could open one for you to go in and have a look.

22
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.300
Don't be ignorant

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.766
Everything is a million-dollar luxury car

24
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.733
Are we in the wrong place today?

25
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.200
Just buy a scooter with tens of thousands of dollars.

26
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.300
Let's go

27
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.700
Yeah, I see you guys have a small budget.

28
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.400
But I didn't expect it to be pitiful.

29
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.300
Tens of thousands of dollars, you dare to come to our slaves

30
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.233
Buy a car at one of its top car dealerships

31
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.666
Even if we can't afford it

32
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.266
You don't have to have that attitude, do you?

33
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.966
You are just a staff member here

34
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.833
Can't we afford it? Can you afford it?
