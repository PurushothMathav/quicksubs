00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.466
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.866
I am the richest man in Beicheng

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.400
Can I still have my 11 jobs?

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.500
Have you never seen a card?

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.400
There are people outside the people, and there are mountains outside the mountains.

6
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.166
You are just the richest man in Little North City

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.700
You don't think no one is harder than you

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.900
You are quibbling

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.033
I don't believe you can swipe this broken card 8 million

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.433
You can swipe my card now.

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.400
Mr. Wu, are you kidding me?

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.733
I've never seen this card before

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.033
How embarrassing it is if you can't brush it out in a while

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.733
Are you trying to be strong today?

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:32.100
Han Xin, you will look at Xu Zhengyue's wife later

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.000
How to get out of the store

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.433
Mr. Long, why don't you think about it again?

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.200
What's the matter with you kid today?

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.800
Be respectful to this brat

20
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.300
Aren't all visitors guests?

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.100
I'll brush it now, I'll brush it now

22
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.033
Damn it if the dragon guard didn't specifically explain

23
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.666
Why are you so humble?

24
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.566
It's too difficult to work as a migrant worker

25
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
Someone like you can be a guardian

26
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.966
God is blind

27
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.166
Pardon me?
