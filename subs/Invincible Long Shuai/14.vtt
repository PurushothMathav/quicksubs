00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.200
You are not reliable today.

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.133
Can you be Mr. Xu's girlfriend?

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.233
Not only will it allow us to return to being an entrepreneur

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.566
It can also give you a better life

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.233
How could you refuse?

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.200
uncle

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.333
I admit what I did before

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.866
Make you feel reliable

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.766
But as soon as you believe me

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.733
I'm back this time

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.766
Be sure to take good care of the stars and the full moon

12
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.966
Ouch, ouch, that's funny, Longjing Tian

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.600
Don't you open your dog eyes to see

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.833
What are you wearing?

15
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.600
How do you take care of your wife and children?

16
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.766
No aunt

17
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.500
My dress is made of a special material.

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.900
It can be preheated and cold-proof.

19
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.666
Can resist knives and guns

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.466
This dress is expensive.

21
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.166
One piece of clothing can buy 3 villas

22
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:44.966
Yo Yo Yo

23
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.566
Long Jingtian, have you watched too many TV dramas?

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.100
Such awesome clothes make you such a trash wear them?

25
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.733
Exactly.

26
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.800
Longjingtian, don't we know how many taels you weigh?

27
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.666
You still know each other

28
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.666
Go where you came from

29
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.600
Don't delay Ye Fan's new climb

30
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.700
Auntie, I'm not leaving

31
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.766
I said I would stay with the stars

32
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.700
I want to make up for him

33
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.766
Don't you just want to be with Nong Shuai?

34
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.900
Is there a chance to meet?

35
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.966
I can give it to you.
