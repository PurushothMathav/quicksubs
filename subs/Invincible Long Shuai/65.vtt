00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.066
Can I be the same as you?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.900
I meet those rich people every day

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.466
My vision

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.366
How can you poor ghosts compare?

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.900
Even if I can't afford it

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.433
You can also see these luxury cars every day

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.133
Can you?

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.400
People like you are a dog and a drunk, have you forgotten your roots?

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.000
Obviously an ordinary person

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.166
You have to put on a superior face

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.966
Hmph, mock others to satisfy your own vanity

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.900
So poor and sad

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.566
You get out of here

14
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.600
We don't entertain you poor people here

15
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.600
I warn you.

16
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.900
Be polite

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.800
Isn't it a million-dollar luxury car?

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.200
Do you think I can't afford it?

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.766
If you can afford it

20
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.266
I call you grandpa

21
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.366
Fine, you grandson!

22
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.666
I'll take it.

23
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.600
Sedum, don't be angry

24
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.166
These people look down on people

25
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.066
Why should we give him performance in vain?

26
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.633
Don't worry. Don't worry.

27
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.266
His professional business?

28
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.833
It's over as of today.

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.366
I will not give him another opportunity to humiliate and taunt others

30
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.433
But trust me.

31
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.933
If you are unreasonable just now

32
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.200
Apologize to us

33
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.166
I can consider it.

34
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.300
Give you a chance to stop checking

35
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.200
Otherwise I will definitely fire you
