00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.366
Dad, can you ride an electric bike?

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.433
Yueyue has never ridden an electric car

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.266
Of course it will.

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.933
After a while, Dad will take Yueyue to ride a bicycle to feel the experience

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.266
So hot so hot

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.633
Wang Xin, let's go buy a car.

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.300
What to buy a car

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.900
Yeah, we should get our own car now, too.

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.233
It's convenient to go out

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.966
In the future, I will not be afraid of freezing after school

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.300
But don't but

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.100
I still have the money for a car

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.433
I haven't been around these years.

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.800
I'm really wronged by you.

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.200
It seems he does want to make up for us.

16
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.133
I want to buy a scooter with tens of thousands of dollars.

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:33.966
It's still possible.

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.266
Well, let's go by bike now.

19
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.766
Mom and Dad, are we going to buy a car?

20
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.366
Yes, Yueyue is not happy

21
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.800
Car oops

22
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.400
Hey hello, we want to see the car

23
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.200
Just watch

24
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.933
Here comes a poor man

25
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.566
Who are you free to entertain?

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.166
How do you speak?
