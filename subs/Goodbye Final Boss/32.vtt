00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.966
I won't pursue the matter with you first.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.766
Please explain it to me first.

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.600
Ask what's going on at home

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.300
I knew he would tell you.

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.000
What's your attitude?

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.566
Anyone who is your wife

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.800
It's okay if you don't help protect it

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.900
Now even his father is not spared

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.900
If it wasn't for Wen Jiaxiang's greed and sincerity, he would have made mistakes first

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.366
How could I have rescued his registration?

11
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:24.866
Yes

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.266
Wen Jiaxiang is not a good person

13
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.700
But also the least lethal

14
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.100
Then just make up the money.

15
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.566
Why do you want to take the last relatives of the young master?

16
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.466
Forced to a dead end Xiaoyan

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.666
He was a miserable child.

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.400
His mother died early

19
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
His father turned a blind eye to him

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.166
I brought him to the Lu family for his enjoyment

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.900
It's not for you to hurt grandma wantonly

22
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.300
Don't be deceived by his delicate appearance

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.100
In fact, he is just like his father

24
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.166
see the money

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.100
scheming

26
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.200
He doesn't deserve your compassion and affection

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.900
Do you want to piss me off?

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.966
Do you know why I insist that you marry Xiaolian?

29
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.233
Do you remember a few years ago?

30
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.400
Something happened to the Gu family's car

31
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.266
The butler took me home

32
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.566
The car is turning

33
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.900
I bumped into it and thought fortunately

34
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.633
Xiaoyan was not seriously injured

35
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.966
No compensation was asked.

36
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.300
He is me

37
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.566
Cover the wound

38
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.233
Insist on taking the mop heart to the hospital with me first

39
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.566
When I wake up

40
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.233
Give him 1 million for presentation

41
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.400
He refused a cent.

42
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.900
Since then

43
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.300
I knew Xiaoyan was a good boy

44
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.700
I also identified him as my granddaughter-in-law

45
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:55.000
But I didn't say you were with Yuan Yingfu

46
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.666
Depth of field, depth of field

47
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:59.300
You are so confused

48
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:04.400
Xia Yunchu was after you officially inherited your appearance

49
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.000
Just haunting you

50
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.100
Don't you realize that there are ulterior motives?

51
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.300
You are eavesdropping
