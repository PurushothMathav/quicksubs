1
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.766
That's fine.

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.033
If in this life

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.100
Is our child you?

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.666
Xiaoyan, listen to me

5
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.866
Tell you to be okay

6
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.166
Baby we can have more

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.466
If you want a few in the future, we will apply, okay?

8
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.466
That's my baby.

9
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.800
I guess my child is gone.

10
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.633
It's a fairy

11
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.333
It's a fairy

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.300
Still dead

13
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.233
But people died on a business trip

14
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.166
You give up chasing her

15
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.433
actually

16
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.666
You must believe me this time.

17
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.100
Xiaoyun

18
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:48.600
I believe you.

19
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.766
But you have to stay calm.

20
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.966
Xia Yunzhu and Zhou Yuhan were handed over to the front

21
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.866
They will pay the price they deserve

22
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.566
Everything falls apart

23
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.400
Born today

24
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.400
Our children are gone.

25
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.300
Don't love you

26
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.600
You to today

27
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.200
Once I didn't want to see Xiaoyan

28
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.266
I did it, jerk.

29
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.566
But I can't live without you

30
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.800
What do you mean?

31
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.766
I want you to love me

32
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.733
Yes

33
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.166
I love you, but I've always refused to admit it

34
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.300
even

35
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.866
Convincing myself to love you by hurting you

36
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.466
Xiaolian

37
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.566
Please forgive my self-talk.

38
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:31.700
Unforgettable

39
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.333
I will spend the rest of my life with everything

40
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.400
To make up for yours

41
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.466
So you love me

42
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.666
You love me

43
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.466
Why am I in so much pain here?

44
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.266
himself

45
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.966
Put it here.

46
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.233
Don't be so late

47
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.266
There you go.

48
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:58.266
light rain

49
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.566
There you go!

50
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.266
I'll be fine
