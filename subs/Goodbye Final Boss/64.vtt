00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.066
Young grandma Young grandma

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.166
Young grandma

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.200
Are you feeling better?

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.666
Wipe your mouth

5
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.700
Is that better?

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.233
Young lady, don't blame me for talking too much

7
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.666
Don't make the young master angry in the future

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.466
You see, the young master actually cares a lot about you

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.900
He's looking out for you.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.233
And there's my spot

11
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.166
What he cares about most

12
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.566
It's just a child in the womb

13
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.266
No, no, young lady.

14
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.366
I feel it.

15
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.933
He treats you differently than he treats others

16
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.800
He was used to touching since he was a child

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800
You see he can't pull this face

18
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.000
He won't talk to you nicely

19
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.600
Ok mom

20
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.166
I'm not in the mood to think about that right now.

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.566
I just want to avenge my grandmother

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.166
Then give birth to the baby in the belly

23
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:03.266
Okay, grandma, I got it. Slow down.

24
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.500
Army, who asked you to come, right?

25
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.200
Can he let me go?

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.800
Dad?

27
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.900
Here's some money.

28
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.533
You can go to other cities as well.

29
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.566
Go abroad

30
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.666
As long as you don't get caught by Lu Cautious

31
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.566
Pardon me?

32
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.500
You let me run

33
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.866
Master Wen, do you still have any conscience?

34
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.966
The company I worked so hard to build

35
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.866
If you say no, you don't want it.

36
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.900
Did you take advantage of me after I left?

37
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.500
Bazhan Company

38
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:47.766
Dad?

39
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.766
The company is now heavily in debt, and you know the law and break the law

40
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:54.000
If you don't leave now, the consequences will be more serious.

41
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.800
Dad?

42
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.000
Hey!

43
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.600
After entering the Lu family's door, you took yourself seriously

44
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.433
If something happens to me, it's okay if you don't help me

45
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.800
You are still working together with Lu Jingshen

46
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.166
Drive me away

47
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.400
Get out of here

48
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.866
This is not my Wei Jiaqiang's daughter
