00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.666
Young Master and Young Grandma, you are back

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.400
Is supper ready?

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.266
Ready. Mmm.

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.266
Ginseng soup from ancient times is also hot on the pot

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.466
I get motion sickness. Let's get up for dinner. Okay.

6
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.666
Thank you bastard

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
It's so hot that the doctor gets you through

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800
Hey young lady

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.366
Let's have soup after dinner

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.433
What do you know as a servant?

11
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.300
Soup is to be drunk before meals

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.033
To fulfill its nutritional value

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.600
Why do you suddenly care about me?

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.700
I'm not being cautious

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.600
Did you move your birthmark today?

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.300
Update you to show humanity

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.366
After all, he is a cautious child.

18
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.266
I'm not lucky to be cared for by you

19
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.400
You eat less or not, that's right

20
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.800
Say less and eat well

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.100
Hey young lady

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.400
I forgot to add sugar to this soup

23
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.166
What to put in the raw soup?

24
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.166
Wang, what's wrong with you today?

25
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.400
Why are you all looking at me?

26
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.400
This soup

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.000
I don't drink that bowl, pour it slowly

28
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.800
My mom worked hard to make soup all afternoon

29
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.100
As you say

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.866
He doesn't drink me
