00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
You don't even spare the children

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.633
I am a vicious woman

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.300
You didn't even say anything about makeup

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.400
How did you become like this?

5
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.500
Every time you stand at home unconditionally

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.300
go out

7
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.700
No matter how much I love

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.833
That would be right or wrong

9
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.400
That being the case

10
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.966
Let's get a divorce.

11
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.066
This Life

12
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.633
Don't hurt him

13
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.400
I fell myself.

14
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.866
However, Wenyan has now filed for divorce

15
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.400
You promise him

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.766
Maybe he has a good place

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.233
Won't let me forever

18
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.533
cautious

19
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.000
Stop being persistent.

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.866
I don't want to take it either

21
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.433
I don't want to bear the infamy of Xiaosan anymore

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.833
I just told Coastal

23
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700
Our Children

24
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.566
He will also be a shameful illegitimate child in the future

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.866
Sister Feng, you are too much.

26
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.466
So

27
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.366
Let's get a divorce.

28
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.433
Let your loved ones and children have their wishes

29
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.466
divorce

30
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800
I won't let you do that.

31
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
Don't forget that your father is still in my hands

32
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:21.600
Our business

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.200
Can you not involve others in this?

34
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.366
Didn't you promise grandma

35
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.033
Won't you do anything to him again?

36
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.600
Didn't you promise grandma not to let it go?

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.300
But missing an arm and a head

38
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.433
It should not be as logical as him, Mr. Wang

39
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:46.566
Success or failure has passed before eccentricity

40
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.233
I won't hold on to my worries anymore
