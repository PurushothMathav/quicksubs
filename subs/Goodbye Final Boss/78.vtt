00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.700
Really the emperor of Beijing

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.433
Hahaha, God's will.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Mom already knew you were promising

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.533
Did you see it?

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.166
These are from my son-in-law

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.733
No dumber than you guys

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:13.966
big

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.300
Stones and small round pillars are much better.

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.900
That's simply not possible.

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.533
Guan Tianyi is a waste

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.333
How could he have such a big business?

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.466
It is Qixian

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.533
No matter whether the things given are true or false

14
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.566
It's true

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.566
It can never be your loyal and righteous

16
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.000
You won't use a fake collar.

17
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Which VIP sent the congratulatory gift?

18
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:35.400
Su Jin, I suggest you better check it out

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.166
To avoid getting slapped in the face in the back

20
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.433
Strange pain Su Qianqian

21
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.833
You don't talk and no one presses you?

22
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.300
Qinger, these are all arranged by me

23
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.666
Go ahead and share with yourself

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.133
Hello, I'm Miss Su Xinsu

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.066
These gifts are from my master

26
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.400
Celebrate the old man's birthday in your name

27
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.433
Hope you accept it with a smile.

28
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.333
It's providence

29
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.933
It's amazing to give so many expensive gifts.

30
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:07.466
Hey, isn't it that you can't see it?

31
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.100
It's not better than yours.

32
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.700
The one from the beginning to the end of the donkey is also a gift, okay?

33
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.066
Why didn't the red tiger come to the red tiger king?

34
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.533
What does this have to do with the Red Tiger King?

35
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.600
You are what our master said

36
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.033
Let's follow up on that Su family trash
