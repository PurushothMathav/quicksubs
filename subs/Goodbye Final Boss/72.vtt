00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.966
Hello what did you say

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.400
And I said, "Okay.

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.966
This is a farce directed and acted by Xia Yunchu

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:05.900
You shut up

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.066
I just want to have a good and cautious child

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.400
There's no time for intrigue with you

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.600
It's you

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.133
You're jealous of me like I'm pregnant

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.133
So colluding with the bastard to harm my child

10
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.300
Don't make trouble for your dirty things

11
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.266
On my head

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.466
How dare you argue, you broom star

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.466
Jingshan, don't be deceived

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.900
At the beginning of the cloud, I was pregnant with your child

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.533
How can you find a scary drug?

16
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.833
Sacrifice your own flesh and blood for the sake of others

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.866
It doesn't make any sense.

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.033
Mom was right

19
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.066
logical

20
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.833
But you missed something.

21
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.700
Is that possible?

22
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.900
Xia Yunchu is not pregnant at all

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:44.866
lie

24
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.500
You are lying!

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.166
Aoyama, you can't be deceived by him

26
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.866
This is people lying to you.

27
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.166
Say you are calm

28
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.666
Is it true?

29
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.033
Ask my mother to feed you

30
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.633
Really?

31
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.066
What are you here to get this bag?

32
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.900
Don't be afraid of having any luxury

33
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.500
Miss Xia gave me Duokan medicine

34
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.200
Let me give it to the young lady

35
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.966
Unexpectedly, he ended up drinking it himself

36
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.633
I didn't mean to.

37
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.400
He threatened me with my son

38
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:20.700
You are an old bitch

39
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.833
I'm going to kill your mouth.

40
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.366
It's all my fault my fault

41
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.400
I killed a clear path

42
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.000
It has nothing to do with you.

43
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.800
There is no such thing as dying in divorce

44
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:34.866
early morning

45
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.466
It must have been the two of them working together

46
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.700
They want to hurt me

47
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.066
You have to teach me a lesson

48
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.600
Your call with Zhongyongheng

49
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.633
I recorded it all
