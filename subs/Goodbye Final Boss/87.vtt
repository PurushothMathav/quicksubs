00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.166
Sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.400
How are you

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.566
It's always been me

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.733
So solving the greenhouse tax problem

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.200
You are the one who carries out the follow-up business work.

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.333
OK

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.300
I'm afraid you're too tired.

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.433
You

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.000
Don't be mad at me for hiding it from you if I tell you

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.300
You will definitely refuse me

11
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.933
What do you want?

12
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:21.733
Xiaoyan

13
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.033
I said I'd get yours back

14
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.333
Now I give you the fan too.

15
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:26.933
I gave you the money too.

16
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.066
How can you rely on

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100
Okay, I recognize these two.

18
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.366
Then you promise me a request.

19
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.233
If you can do it, I promise to try it with you

20
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.400
What is it?

21
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.866
What can't be done with this?

22
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:51.733
light rain

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.433
I've been waiting for you to put it back on for you for a day

24
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.366
you

25
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.000
Didn't you give it to Xia Yun?

26
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.233
Ah, he bought the ring on his hand himself.

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.633
But I don't know.

28
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.066
He bought it on purpose to be as delicious as our wedding rings

29
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.866
Xiaoyu, let me put it back on for you. Okay.

30
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.233
Sorry Mr. Wen

31
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.066
But congratulations.

32
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:31.100
I wish Mr. Wen and Mr. Lu a century of harmony
