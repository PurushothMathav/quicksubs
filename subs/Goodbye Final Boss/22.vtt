00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.666
Grandma Xiao Wang

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.600
What happened to Xiaoyan?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.766
Why are you crying?

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:11.166
Grandma, I need your help with something

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Dear granddaughter, please speak slowly.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.433
Don't worry.

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.600
Here's the thing.

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.033
Xiaoyan, at that time, I tried my best to match you and caution

9
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.866
On the one hand, I want to see with my own eyes and start a family cautiously

10
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.166
And on the other hand?

11
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.566
I want you to get rid of it as soon as possible

12
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.633
Your father's control and exploitation

13
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.400
It doesn't sound good.

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.600
Your father doesn't have the slightest parental affection for you

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.400
Nana

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.600
I know you love me

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.566
My mother died early

18
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.900
Although my father is not very kind to me

19
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.666
But blood is thicker than water

20
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.233
But my only lover in the world

21
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.066
I can't just watch him go to jail

22
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:51.966
grandma

23
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.000
Silly child, Jingshan and I are both your relatives

24
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.900
grandma

25
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.366
I didn't ask you for anything

26
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.566
Just help me this once

27
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.800
Grandma, okay, auntie, don't worry.

28
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.266
Grandma will figure it out

29
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.633
Thank you, Grandma.

30
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.800
Which man borrowed you?

31
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.566
My mom wasn't here before

32
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.666
Since you can't do it well, Mrs. Lu

33
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.000
Learn to be a good nanny

34
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.633
The Lu family doesn't need money

35
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.800
I'll rent you something to eat and serve it up.

36
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.166
cautious
