00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.100
Help! Help!

2
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.233
Jade Emperor, are you really with Xia Yun?

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.100
Xiaoyan

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.133
Why are you so gullible?

5
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.766
Why do you even believe in cancer, hahaha?

6
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.266
That's because I believe

7
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.466
Friend for so many years, why are you doing this?

8
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.066
Because I want money

9
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.466
I want a lot of money and

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.300
And this woman

11
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.600
What do you want?

12
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.600
I haven't done anything yet

13
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.166
You are afraid

14
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Then when you steal the depth of field

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.200
You should have thought of today

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.166
He is a person, not an object

17
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.933
I can't just grab it if I want to

18
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.100
Besides, I never really had him.

19
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.166
Shut up and be gentle

20
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.833
Jingshen refuses to sign the agreement

21
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.233
Not you yet

22
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.500
With a very innocent face

23
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.300
Who knows what it's like to be private

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.366
The charming look hooks me up in this life, I don't believe it, and I don't love me either

25
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.300
You say

26
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.233
If I put a line on your face

27
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.600
Will I still love you in this life?

28
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.533
Xu Yuzhuo, calm down

29
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.266
Why are you educating me?

30
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.766
What do you know?

31
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.133
I grew up in an orphanage.

32
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.733
Being bullied and humiliated

33
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.266
If I'm not cruel

34
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.500
Haha, how do you think I got here?

35
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.866
Your situation is not a reason for you to hurt others

36
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.533
But my hands have already attracted character

37
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.300
There is no turning back

38
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:56.833
I have to take the last step today

39
00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.266
Come on.

40
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.600
Draw bowls on your best friend's face

41
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.000
Hahahaha, here it comes, third master

42
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.900
Stop
