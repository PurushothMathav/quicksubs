00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.166
Baby

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.400
After mom settles everything

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.266
Just take you away

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.233
You have to be obedient

5
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:25.400
It's not like this about dealing with grandma

6
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.366
Young grandma has eaten

7
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.100
I'll be down in a minute

8
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.400
jing sheng

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.166
I was talking too fast.

10
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.700
I apologize to you.

11
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.033
I'm sorry, since Wen Yan is pregnant

12
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.866
Then let him stay

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.233
From now on, under the same roof

14
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.966
I will tolerate him more

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.366
I'm glad you feel that way.

16
00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:00.066
In fact, our baby months are getting bigger and bigger.

17
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.466
I'm going to the maternity check-up today.

18
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.766
The doctor said it was a big fat boy

19
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.666
I will definitely give birth to a son for you

20
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.233
Wang Ma, this bitter melon turtle soup was prepared by you

21
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.366
I don't know.

22
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.666
It's me. I'm at the Michelin restaurant.

23
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.566
I waited in line for a long time to buy it.

24
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.266
Warm words, I used to speak badly

25
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.400
You take care of it.

26
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.633
Drink more soup to replenish your body

27
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:26.933
The beginning of summer

28
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:27.666
Do you know

29
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.966
Do not eat bitter melon and methanol in the early stage of pregnancy

30
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.600
These two things are very likely to cause miscarriage

31
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.766
How is that possible?

32
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.900
I've been eating it every day lately.

33
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.266
Is there any problem?

34
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.400
Are you sure this kind of sugar should not be drunk by pregnant women?

35
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.633
It's your say

36
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.433
Shut up, you have no common sense.

37
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.900
Still not pregnant at all

38
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.866
What do you mean in classical Chinese?

39
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:52.066
Stop looking for thieves and shout out thieves, don't make noise

40
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.466
Call the doctor

41
00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:56.700
Check each of them
