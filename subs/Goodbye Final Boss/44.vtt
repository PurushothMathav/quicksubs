00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.500
Grandma, why are you here?

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.500
Ah, you miss your great-grandson, right?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.500
My baby and I are doing well

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.866
Tight and took me to the maternity check-up. Shut up

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.766
I haven't admitted that you care about your stomach disease

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.800
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
Do you want to continue living here?

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.033
I'm pregnant with a tight child

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.900
Of course I want to be with my brother-in-law

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.766
Grandma, you are old now.

11
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.833
Don't mock young people

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.366
After all, I'm not like some people.

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.900
I can't even get pregnant

14
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.166
Just coax

15
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.466
Wife

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.100
What's your attitude?

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.333
What's your attitude?

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.766
What's my attitude?

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.866
Don't go too far in early summer

20
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.266
Grandma finally came back once

21
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.300
I didn't want him to get pissed off.

22
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.800
Am I too much?

23
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.033
I'm just stating the facts

24
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.066
You're like a hen that can't lay eggs now

25
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.300
I can only coax my seventy-year-old and eighty-year-old wife

26
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
Be careful when he is gone.

27
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.666
You don't even have your last resort

28
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.900
Yunzhu, keep your mouth shut

29
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.100
How dare you hit me?

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.800
If you curse grandma again, I won't just hit even

31
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.400
What do you want?

32
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000
I'm pregnant.

33
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.033
If you hurt your only child

34
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.066
debt responsibility

35
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.033
Go ahead and tell them.

36
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.666
What are you harassing?

37
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.000
You're going to divorce him anyway

38
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.933
In the future, I can only coax this old woman

39
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.233
Divorce Xiaoyan

40
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.666
How come?
