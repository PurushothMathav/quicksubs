00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.566
You are eavesdropping

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.900
No sister

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.033
Did it ever occur to you that contagion is somebody else's?

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.100
After the car accident

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.033
I was planning how to do this.

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.600
No, I wasn't eavesdropping.

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.766
I'm not planning anything either

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.600
This is Lao Zhuang

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.666
Put away your piece

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.766
Your goal

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.966
Yeah, since you got married on vacation

12
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.400
I assumed you were a dog

13
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.966
No matter how you raise it, you will be fooled

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.233
Xiaoyan didn't clean up these abilities

15
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.066
Don't hurt yourself!

16
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.166
You two, how about I go to Guanbeimen Village?

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.000
Well done this time

18
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.633
Now everyone in the Lu family thinks I'm really pregnant

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.866
It won't be long

20
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.000
The location of the young lady of the Lu family

21
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.466
It belongs to me.

22
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.866
Who to call again

23
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.200
Why don't you rest well?

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.166
Isn't this about to pass the Qixi Festival?

25
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.266
I think you've been wearing your old wedding ring

26
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.966
I want to order a ring that belongs to us.

27
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.466
I was just calling the jewelry store.

28
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.700
Sir?

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.233
When are you going to take off the red sword?

30
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.833
You and him, we're not divorced yet

31
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.766
In order to keep the media from being haunted

32
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.566
Can't the review depend on this?

33
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.700
ring

34
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.766
You can buy one yourself first.

35
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:41.700
Use my card

36
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:48.200
The good guests haven't left yet, I have to go and greet them

37
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.233
There will be a pit when you're done.

38
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.366
Handsome sorry

39
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.166
Handsome, did you lose something?

40
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.466
Let me help you find it.

41
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.233
No, don't want what you don't want.
