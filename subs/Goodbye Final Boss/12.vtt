1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.466
Dad?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.933
Why are you here?

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.966
If father-in-law doesn't come

4
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.700
How do I know if someone is lying to me again?

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.800
cautious

6
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.600
What are you talking about, you piece of shit?

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.066
It's unreliable to let you do something

8
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.233
Where's the money dad

9
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.666
Besides money, don't you want to ask me what's wrong?

10
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.100
Anyway, you can't die. You can eat and drink well in the Lu family.

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.433
What are you pretending to go

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.600
You women, don't argue in front of me

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.800
I'm sick of you kowtowing

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.700
That's the bottom line.

15
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.266
Then 8 million two families are closed

16
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.566
But the Du family is not obligated to be your housekeeper

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.866
Besides, it wasn't my intention to marry your daughter

18
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.233
No, right?

19
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.933
Okay, so now go to the reporter to break the news

20
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.966
Your Lu family is bullying others

21
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.000
The son-in-law must be angry with the father-in-law

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.000
Please be patient. I also want to make an appointment for some inheritance.

23
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.966
Talk to them about the Wen Group

24
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.566
Tax evasion

25
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.266
Your dad

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.100
You go first

27
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.066
You must be your trash

28
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.300
It upsets my son-in-law

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.900
What are you, your wife?

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.766
It was my father-in-law who said angry words just now, don't take them to heart

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.533
And this wife should be beaten

32
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.066
If he messes with you

33
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.400
Just teach me a lesson.

34
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.966
My classroom doesn't bother you

35
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.466
Wang Ma locks the guest, no need, no need.

36
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.300
I'll go by myself.

37
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.900
For money, you are both a pear tree and a cherry

38
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.233
Acting very hard

39
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.333
Actually, I don't care about my body

40
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.466
I just want to know

41
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.500
You say you love me

42
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.166
Do you not believe

43
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.900
I married you because I love you

44
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.400
It's not because of the money of the Lu family

45
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.466
Then 8 million I'll borrow it from Yuhuan

46
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.766
You are so stingy

47
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.666
Sorry to marry another man

48
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:59.000
Lack of money and lack of men, right?

49
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.100
Then you pay me for the lack of land
