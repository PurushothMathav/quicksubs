00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.866
Sir, you doubt me?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.066
I asked Wang An about that person

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.533
Nothing happened to us at all

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.766
No, no.

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.900
It must be the old maid

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.566
It must be him.

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.100
He is loving and stern

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.833
He wants to harm our children together

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.700
Mom, I brought the murderer here for you

10
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.066
I disdain to use such underhanded means

11
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.866
Girl, slowly

12
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.500
Son, you must sign this word today

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.166
There's no room for this poisonous woman in our house

14
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.466
Be careful not to be obsessed

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.466
I see.

16
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.966
It was your grandmother who forced you to marry this poisonous woman

17
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.700
But now your grandma is dead

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.800
You can be liberated from this life

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.500
I have no children now.

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.566
If you still don't want to marry me

21
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.966
Then in the eyes of others, I am like a bully

22
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.166
How else do you want me to live?

23
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.033
Police comrade

24
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.000
Someone framed me for murder

25
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.466
Please come over.

26
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.066
What is this for?

27
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.600
You don't think I'm a murderer, grandma

28
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.800
child's

29
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.866
Then let the police handle this matter.

30
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.233
If I am guilty

31
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.966
Let the police convict me

32
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.166
If I am not guilty

33
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.300
I hope the real murderer can be brought to justice

34
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:32.033
Those who slandered and framed me can apologize to me

35
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.500
I think you should be fine too.

36
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.066
Hey.

37
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.366
I still go through things at home

38
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.166
Are the police good?

39
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.400
And I haven't recovered yet.

40
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.466
Restore what

41
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:45.833
Not pregnant.

42
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.033
Come back with an abortion
