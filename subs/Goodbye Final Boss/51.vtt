00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.900
This bitch is really haunted

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.700
Since you hate that dead old lady so much

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.300
Then you go to hell with him

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.800
How's it going? Is the car ready?

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.000
Do something neat

6
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.000
After this is done, money is indispensable

7
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.766
It's all my fault if it wasn't for me

8
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.300
Marriage can't be crooked

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.266
Kill without thinking too much

10
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.466
It has nothing to do with you.

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.166
But I feel bad.

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.800
Although grandma doesn't accept me

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.000
But I already consider him my own grandmother.

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.700
I'm going to participate in the policy explanation

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.433
Do you not love me anymore?

16
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.600
Did you tell him I'm just tired?

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.066
But you said you were going to get a divorce.

18
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.033
I've been waiting for you.

19
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.966
After the funeral

20
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.000
I will leave him immediately

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.033
Then you have to leave him quickly

22
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.400
Who knew he was such a dangerous person

23
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.533
What other hurtful things will you do?

24
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.666
I don't know.

25
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.033
How could he kill someone and kneel in the rain?

26
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.900
Grandma's Spirit in Heaven

27
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.866
Certainly not at ease

28
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.466
He's still out there

29
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.300
Yes!

30
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.166
Grandma's words

31
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.466
There are too many spring and autumn in your arms that you will not understand
