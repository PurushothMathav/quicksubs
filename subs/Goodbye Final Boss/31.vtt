00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.433
My stomach hurts.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.400
Our child can't have a body

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.166
This is the heir of our Lu family

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.300
Nothing must happen.

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.100
Butler, call the doctor over here

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.566
Yes, in the cloud, please hold on.

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.866
The doctor is coming.

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800
It's absurd. It's absurd

9
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.066
Grandma, don't be angry

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.766
Xiaoyan

11
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.166
Grandma wouldn't let that woman in the door

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.400
Don't worry, as long as grandma has a breath

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.266
It's my grandma's place and it will always be me

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.666
This remnant body can't make face for the Gu family at all

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.466
Purple grandma is so nice to me

16
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.600
I can't be selfish anymore.

17
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.333
grandma

18
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.000
In fact, my divorce from Lu Jinsheng is quite good

19
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.900
It can fulfill Lu Jinsheng

20
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.966
It can also make Xia Yun let out the child in his belly

21
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.433
Have a complete home

22
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.333
Are you worried about your father?

23
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.633
Don't be afraid.

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.433
I'll talk to the police myself later

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.000
As for the children?

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.900
Grandma didn't do that

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.400
Even if you can't have children

28
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.566
Grandma won't blame you

29
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.366
grandma

30
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.033
That doesn't show money

31
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.066
What age is this?

32
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.300
Those old things that carry on the family line?

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.166
It's way out of date.

34
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.100
Xiaoyan as long as you want

35
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.766
After Xia Yunchu gave birth to the child

36
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.700
You have the mental intention to raise mom, isn't that good?

37
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.900
The child still needs to be brought by his mother

38
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.200
Besides, our daughter-in-law

39
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.766
She's a broken woman who can't have children

40
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.400
If outsiders find out

41
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.766
How can we still establish a foothold in the Lu family?

42
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.100
You shut up

43
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.133
How am I doing?

44
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.433
Leave that alone.

45
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.033
Jingshan, follow me to the kitchen

46
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.200
I have something to say
