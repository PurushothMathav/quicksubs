00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.500
Gentle now

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.066
Already knew the cancer story was fake

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.466
Now it's ruining the only good days left

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.500
The next thing will be difficult

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:14.066
It's all your fault for letting you get killed in a car accident

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.866
Can't even kill a woman

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.000
It's not that your caution is out of the emperor

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.566
Laugh carefully and blame the cleaning

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.666
You were targeting this man just now

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.700
I can warn you

11
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.966
Don't forget our original agreement

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.533
I pursue warmth

13
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.666
To sow discord in front of Lu Jingsheng

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.400
You seduced Lu Jingshan to replace Wen Yan's position

15
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.900
Get the shares of the Lu family and before and after

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.666
How do our people fly?

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.233
Of course I'm not.

18
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.200
It's not that I didn't find a girl. What should I do now?

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.266
I used to doubt me now

20
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.066
People who wake up for the rest of their lives are also looking for me

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.833
I've been inconvenient recently.

22
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.266
Aerospace

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.000
I know you've been inconvenient lately

24
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.366
But

25
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:02.466
As long as you can get me some abortion pills

26
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.200
The rest.

27
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.100
Just leave it to me

28
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:10.833
Baozi

29
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.866
Hey, I hate it, take it with you

30
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.766
Isn't it a fake pregnancy without you?

31
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.800
Then I'll go get him a real one

32
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.166
Where did you go last night?

33
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.400
My friend asked me for something yesterday.

34
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.066
Why did you start talking to me too?

35
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.300
Didn't I quarrel with Wenyan yesterday?

36
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.700
I was thinking about math school

37
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.233
The heart is in the back ready to live

38
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.866
That's right.

39
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.500
Be careful, I know you care about me

40
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.566
You can't take care of me, but you're fine

41
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:58.866
I still have things to do

42
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.066
cautious

43
00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.100
Hey check it out
