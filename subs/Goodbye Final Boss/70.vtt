00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.166
Promise against you

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.066
Mom, please show some respect.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.733
Am I wrong?

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.800
Your mother died saving your life

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.533
The old lady is also because you fell on a rock

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.466
No one mom

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.066
How did you know grandma hit the rock?

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.900
Isn't that place also based on kindness?

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.766
Butler Lu told me

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.300
He wasn't there.

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.466
Mom, what have you done?

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.500
What nonsense are you talking about?

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.566
I think you're crazy!

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.933
I'm going to tell the depth of field

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.166
I'm going to ask him to check

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.100
You shut up

17
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100
You killed Yunzuo's child

18
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.566
Feel guilty

19
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.900
Saying this on purpose to confuse the public

20
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.533
If you have no evidence

21
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.166
I will accuse you of framing

22
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.700
Mom, when you bite me a murderer

23
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.800
Have you ever thought that would be a false accusation for me as well?

24
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.666
Ok, the depth of field is not there.

25
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.100
You're yelling at me now

26
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.400
You are going to the hospital with me now

27
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.166
I want Jing Shen to see your wicked face

28
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.700
Okay, I'll hum with you.

29
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.133
cautious

30
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.700
You must avenge our children

31
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.200
Never let go of nonsense

32
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.000
This bowl of soup has 5 buddies

33
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.066
Why are you protecting him?

34
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.666
That night he was just him and the bastard

35
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.733
Fear only him

36
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:24.766
You calm down first

37
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.300
Tell me about it.

38
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:29.700
I promise you I will find out about this.

39
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.833
But before that

40
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.433
Let me ask you something.

41
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.833
That child is mine
