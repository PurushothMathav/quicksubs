00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.466
Aren't you happy?

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.833
I am not happy that you are qualified with me

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.300
Tired, I'll push you to rest.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.266
Then I'll go clean up the guest room

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.166
WenYuan

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:12.866
Wait a minute.

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.733
What's wrong? I get scared when I sleep alone.

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.500
What are you afraid of? I'm here.

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.966
Since the last time I was pushed from upstairs

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.466
So I did it every night.

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.766
500 people in the room

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.266
What are you still doing here?

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.533
bitch

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.100
You should have died with my mother

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.666
What are you saying?

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.033
You got your wish

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.900
And Yunchu

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.733
Just wanted to see me one last time before going abroad

19
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.266
Why don't you let him go?

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.900
I don't have you to shut up

21
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.833
If grandma hadn't forced me

22
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.600
I press

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.933
I will never marry a woman with a venomous heart like you

24
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.666
I heard that if anything goes wrong

25
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.200
You're just waiting to go to hell

26
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.433
Nonsense, it's you who's sorry for Wenyan

27
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.466
I didn't mean that.

28
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.266
or

29
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.233
I'm leaving. Where are you going?

30
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.266
It's the culprit who should go

31
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.700
I don't think I can use the guest room.

32
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.266
You live with me

33
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.566
No matter how much I love

34
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.766
You are also in your heart only next time

35
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.700
You never look at me

36
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.100
6 things you hate about me so much
