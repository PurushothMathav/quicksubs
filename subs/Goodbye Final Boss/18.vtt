00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.400
Master Wei, what are you talking about?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.166
Because I'm dying

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.166
Continue to rely on you

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.966
It will only slow you down

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.166
We are not suitable

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.366
Why do you feel inappropriate now?

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.133
You married me two years ago

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.566
Why are you not allowed to swallow the killer on Yun Chu?

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.866
I have explained it to you many times.

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.466
It was the cloud that rolled down by itself

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.100
I didn't push it down.

12
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.000
How could you not believe me?

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.966
Then why are we still together?

14
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.033
What about torture?

15
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.466
Being with me is torture

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.200
OK, then let me continue to torture you.

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.400
Did I tell you the truth?

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.200
Last night?

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.800
I took the initiative to seduce Mr. Chen

20
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.200
Who made him rich?

21
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.566
Pardon me?

22
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.566
And I said, "Okay.

23
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.866
I do not love you

24
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.566
From start to finish

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.800
I only want your money.

26
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.633
Then your dad asked me for money

27
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.366
Yes, yes!

28
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.033
I penetrated it with my dad

29
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.966
I still haven't

30
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:20.633
Anything will do.

31
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.100
I should never have let the transporter give you blood

32
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.200
You should be left to die on the operating table

33
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.300
You you

34
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.433
I'm sick of not knowing his blood

35
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.700
Me too, don't push your luck

36
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.533
I pass out my stomach and your bleeding

37
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.033
He's still in bed.

38
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.633
If you don't understand, don't repay your kindness

39
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.400
How would I tell you to hold him slowly?

40
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:50.100
He can forget the infinity of the sea

41
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:51.833
If you still can't find it

42
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.300
Then don't blame me for being infatuated with him
