00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.600
This life is really hard

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.266
Let's go up and let him speak first

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.766
I'd like to see it

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.866
What other disaster can he throw at him?

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.766
After all, you still can't do it.

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.466
Count stop

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.966
This is the nutritious meal ordered by the doctor

8
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.200
Do it now.

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.700
Marketing needs to be supplemented

10
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.400
Not his nanny

11
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.466
Mo Yan

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.066
Your current words and deeds

13
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.666
It's about your father's wealth

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.300
Be yourself or not

15
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.066
You stay with me all day

16
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.833
Will it be bad if I go to the company?

17
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.166
There is nothing more important than your body now

18
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.066
Then can you always be with me?

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.300
I've been getting more and more bachelors lately

20
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.566
Don't worry, I promise.

21
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.500
No one here dares to hurt you again

22
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.433
Thank you warmly

23
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.666
As Mrs. Lu

24
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.433
Also serve me

25
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.000
Will you be unhappy?

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.900
He grabbed the spot where you missed the tire

27
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.633
Let him do something for you

28
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.100
I'm not unhappy.

29
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.233
Why are your hands so careless?

30
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.166
Not in the way, a little burn

31
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.766
This is pumpkin porridge according to your recipe

32
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.900
That's right. What are you doing?
