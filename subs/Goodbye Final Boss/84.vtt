00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.233
How can you follow the president's itinerary at will?

9
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.800
But don't you think our president is a good match?

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.500
Mr. Chen, do we want to talk about cooperation in another place?

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.200
I don't want cooperation anymore.

15
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.866
No, please ask Mr. Chen.

16
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.200
What are your thoughts on our company's projects?

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.066
Let's forget about the past.
