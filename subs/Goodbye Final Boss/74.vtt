00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.433
Of course I'm here to see you one last time

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.000
In fact, when I think of you

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.666
Then you don't belong to me anymore

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.266
I'm very uncomfortable

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.700
I cried and begged him for a long time

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.433
He wouldn't. He pushed me off.

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.066
It's true. It's true.

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.466
What I explained is

9
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.300
The young master has found the servant that night

10
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.400
He said Miss Xia was looking for 10 million

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.066
It seems to be a breakup fee

12
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.666
Young grandma is afraid that you will be sad

13
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.600
Just take it and don't let him see it

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.400
you

15
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.500
Lying makes people lie

16
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.500
Continue to scold the young lady if Miss Xia can't get the money

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.166
When I saw you coming, I deliberately biked downstairs

18
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.466
No, yes.

19
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.300
What good things do you have now?

20
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.966
What do you mean, you must be this traditional person?

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.800
Otherwise, you wouldn't have known I was investigating this.

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.833
Sorry for the police

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.733
I just love you so much

24
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.500
I'm so afraid of losing you

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.266
I've been misunderstanding

26
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.066
Speaking to ask for leave

27
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.766
You are the one who will do anything for your love

28
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.033
No.

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.500
This Life

30
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.100
I admit it.

31
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.166
At the beginning

32
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.033
I did it for the money.

33
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.233
But get along slowly

34
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.900
I found that I really fell in love with you

35
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.066
actually

36
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.566
Give me another chance.

37
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.600
You almost killed my child

38
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.100
How can I give you a chance?

39
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.700
From today onwards

40
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.166
I don't want to see you again.

41
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:34.566
True God

42
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.066
Dare to calculate the money of my Lu family and get out of here with my son

43
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.833
Auntie, don't forget

44
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.100
We are on the same path now

45
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.700
If you dare to cross the river and tear down the bridge

46
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.900
We'll shake all grandma's hands out

47
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.466
you
