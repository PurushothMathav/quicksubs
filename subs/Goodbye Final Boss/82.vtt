1
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.300
Wei, hold on, Wei

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.700
Doctor, you must cut him

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.133
Does someone else have a voice?

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.500
We'll meet him first

5
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.866
Sands Sands

6
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.733
This is all done by Zhou Yuheng

7
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.866
It has nothing to do with me.

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.866
Zhou Yuhengzi and Lao Li have confessed

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.500
Grandma's death

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.633
That woman's car is your arm

11
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.066
Xiang Yucheng

12
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.366
You are terrible

13
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.466
No, grandma's death has nothing to do with me

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.666
I thought it was my eyes that killed my grandmother.

15
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.400
At this time, you still come to quibble with me

16
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.366
Xiaocheng, you have disappointed me so much

17
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.266
The woman I protect with all my heart

18
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.966
It turned out to be the murderer who hurt my man

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.966
I hate myself when I think about it

20
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:53.866
cautious

21
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.666
I do all this

22
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
I just want to be with you

23
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.266
I just want us to live a good life

24
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.033
It's them

25
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.300
They got in the way. I had to

26
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.200
Are you going to kill me if I have to?

27
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.700
Right

28
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.066
You don't deserve it.

29
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.000
My eyes are also hahahaha

30
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.200
I give him leadership today

31
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.100
Did it kill him? Is he dead?

32
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.000
Jinshan

33
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.133
If my grandpa dies

34
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.666
We can be together

35
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.000
Forever together

36
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.100
I really want to go ashore in the next car

37
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.600
The door of the generation

38
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.366
Don't get your hands dirty

39
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.066
The days that follow

40
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.100
Reflect on yourself in prison

41
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.100
police

42
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:07.166
Hello, Mr. Du, Miss Wei is awake

43
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.400
I'll be right back
