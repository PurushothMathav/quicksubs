00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.200
Du Jingsheng, are you crazy?

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.833
Do you know Xiaoyan's body?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.633
I only know that Yunzuo needs Shu Qi

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.200
As for him, I think he is in good health

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:11.866
a little

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.800
The editor came to the hospital in a small pain and pretended to be hospitalized

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.166
But that's just right

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.033
It is more convenient and timely to feed comfortably in the hospital

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.966
Stop it and go

10
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.900
He's your wife.

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.500
You are so cruel to him

12
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.800
It turned out that only the doctor did not know that he was a farmer

13
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.200
They are the same blood

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.566
You can't get in.

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.633
Remember to prioritize the safety of the distribution

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:38.733
tired

17
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.000
It doesn't matter.

18
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.233
If it is your cruel heart

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.166
Husband and wife for two years

20
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.500
I'm at your place.

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.566
Still unworthy of a name

22
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.400
My broken body

23
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.266
Won't last long

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.466
Soon as you wish

25
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.066
I hope you don't hold this unhappy one in the future.

26
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.366
Young grandma, you only had two counts of blood yesterday

27
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.833
The body is very weak

28
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.900
Let's eat something first

29
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.766
You come back

30
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.266
Ming Zhe, if you don't like being hospitalized, we won't live there

31
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.233
But I don't worry if you live alone

32
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.733
You will live here from now on

33
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.300
Thanks to my eyes this time

34
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.700
If it weren't for him

35
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:35.400
I might die

36
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.366
This is your home after all

37
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.500
Would it be bad if I lived here?

38
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.000
This house was originally designed to marry you

39
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.166
Who saves the dowry?

40
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:49.233
Forget it, don't mention the unpleasant things

41
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.400
You will live in the future

42
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.600
Make yourself at home

43
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.000
I am happy.

44
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.433
Speechless

45
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
He won't be happy.

46
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.566
You are not happy
