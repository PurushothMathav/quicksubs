00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.133
Oh, son.

2
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.033
What are you doing here without sleeping at night?

3
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
Looking for something? What?

4
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.866
So important

5
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.333
Oops, mom is sleepy, mom is going to sleep

6
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.900
Why don't you rest early?

7
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.000
Too hard to serve

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.533
Let me send him the ring I received.

9
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.200
He thought I was cheap and soiled his ring

10
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.333
He actually hit me and rummaged through the young lady's things

11
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.700
That arrogant look

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.833
Just like the two people at the party

13
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.033
Why are you here?

14
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.066
This is me and the tight bedroom

15
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.866
What will be wrong with me in the future?

16
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:02.300
If you can see more, you can see more.

17
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.666
Maybe.

18
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.433
I can't even get in the door

19
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.366
Why are you touching my stuff?

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.066
These things

21
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.566
It's Lu Taiping

22
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.366
Not your eyes

23
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.233
Did you see it?

24
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.233
Jingshen put your wedding ring

25
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.866
Brought it to me

26
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.400
It won't be long

27
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.633
I am the justifiable Mrs. Lu

28
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.700
Why are you still relying on him?

29
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.200
No way. It must be a fake

30
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.100
You are the fake

31
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.866
The war has been going on for so long and I'm still not satisfied.

32
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.366
How can I be cautious with my wedding ring?

33
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:43.766
You're not divorcing me?

34
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.600
As long as I am Mrs. Lu for one day

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.766
You will always be the little three who can't see the light

36
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.566
But

37
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.333
perfunctory
