00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.066
This is pumpkin porridge according to your recipe

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.233
That's right. What are you doing?

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.100
I don't know.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.200
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.600
Live ok ok

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.766
I thought of that day, Chen Jingjing, I said you could understand

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.833
I'm sorry, I'll clean it up for you.

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.700
I didn't think about him.

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.666
You were hurt by him

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.900
There should be no physical contact for a short period of time

11
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.500
Or how do I do it?

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.766
I won't let the lady pay the bill.

13
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.600
Don't blame him for giving birth to you

14
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.466
He is your wife after all

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.366
How is it possible to be willing to take care of

16
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.066
It's okay if he doesn't want to.

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.566
As long as you want

18
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.366
I have to take care of it for the rest of my life

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.766
How deep is the field of breastfeeding?

20
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.966
You and Xiao Yang haven't returned to the old house for a long time

21
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.933
I miss grandma

22
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.966
No, I asked your father to throw a seder

23
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.800
Will you bring my granddaughter-in-law back early tomorrow?

24
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.066
Got it, bye.

25
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.400
Young lady, dress up

26
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.366
Prettier than a star on TV

27
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.633
This is to go back to the Lu family with the young master

28
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.600
I heard from the people over there in the old house

29
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.100
This family dinner was fooled

30
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.666
It's not just the Lu family

31
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.300
What else is there in business?

32
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.633
And a lot of people in politics

33
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.466
What do you mean in this life?

34
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:34.866
In my heart

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.033
There is only one granddaughter-in-law of the Lu family

36
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.266
That is Yunchu

37
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.600
So what's the problem with me taking her there?

38
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.566
Go back to grandma and wipe it

39
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.900
You know where you are

40
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.566
Don't always waste your appearance

41
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:53.066
OK, I'll take you up there now.
