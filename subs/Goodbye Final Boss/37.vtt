00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.800
I know it's not convenient for you to go to my place.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.066
Nobody lives there.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.000
You are here

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.200
No one will disturb you.

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.466
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.133
It's so late to help me find a house to live in

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.166
Oh yes, I'll come to you tomorrow morning.

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.733
The number of the expert who studied the koan case

9
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.466
Very difficult to make an appointment

10
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.366
Come to our hospital tomorrow for exchange and study.

11
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.300
We must seize this opportunity

12
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.500
OK

13
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.700
Ono

14
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.500
I'm glad you moved out

15
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.033
This means you have given up on him

16
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:27.966
So

17
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.000
Can you consider me?

18
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.233
Yuhang, I have always regarded you as a friend.

19
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.000
No such feelings

20
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.366
Sorry, feelings can be cultivated

21
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.766
My body may not fall one day

22
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.166
I don't want to delay you.

23
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.100
Xiaoyan, I'm not afraid to delay you.

24
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.800
Give me a chance.

25
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.866
I must do better than Lu Jinsheng, right?

26
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.966
Aerospace I'm tired

27
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.233
You go back first

28
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.266
I said why are you in such a hurry?

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.700
It turned out that he moved out to live with him
