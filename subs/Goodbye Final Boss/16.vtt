00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.900
Feed depth of field

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.466
Are you still coming?

3
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.833
Is it gentle that he disagrees?

4
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.766
Doctor, how is he?

5
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.000
The activity of the patient jewelry needs to be entered.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.200
But now the hospital blood bank is advanced

7
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.500
You have to find someone bloody identical right away

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.500
Come and give it to him

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.200
Hey, tell me

10
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.100
Others have a poor sense of survival

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.766
Can you hear my aunt say

12
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.400
You have to be mentally prepared for this

13
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.033
What happened to Tiesheng?

14
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:48.233
Wen Yan is a cheap learner

15
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.600
Suicide

16
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.400
OK

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.266
We'll see.

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.300
Let's see who gets the qi first

19
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.500
What's the use of me raising you guys?

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.633
You can't find a bloody match

21
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.066
Yes, if you ask me again if I bring it or not

22
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.366
Sometimes all the leftovers get the hell out of me

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.800
cautious

24
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.833
What's your trouble?

25
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.133
Does the property need to bleed?

26
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.300
Get the doctor out of here

27
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.666
Just be a security guard and look at the past

28
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.033
You live, I heard it on the phone

29
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.466
Don't worry, the hospital will be fine.

30
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.200
I'll do whatever you want

31
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.266
Ok

32
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.200
Your body is still weak

33
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.433
Can't smoke these

34
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.366
The patient is in urgent condition and needs to go out immediately

35
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.400
The doctor smoked me

36
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.633
I'm an adventurer.
