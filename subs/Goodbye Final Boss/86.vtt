00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.700
You bastard

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.300
What did you do to me last night?

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.166
Last night, you held me in your arms

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.833
I was drunk on you last night.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.166
Won't you refuse?

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.233
I wish you could hold me, why should I refuse you?

7
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.000
You are shameless

8
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.666
I'm not shameless.

9
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.400
Why is that my wife?

10
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.666
I'll pretend I slept with a free duck

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.700
What's wrong? I'm angry.

12
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.633
Not angry

13
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.366
You must have enjoyed it last night

14
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.166
Remember to come back and help me celebrate my birthday.

15
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.566
Young Master and Young Grandma, breakfast is ready

16
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.500
Thank you Wang Ma

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.666
But I have to go first

18
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.800
Let's go after breakfast

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.333
Master Lu, I'm not as big as you

20
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.900
The company has a lot of things waiting for me to deal with.

21
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.566
My money is not all yours

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.500
Lu Jingsheng, you are you

23
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.466
I am I

24
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.333
If you delay my meeting with the new shareholders any longer

25
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.600
I'm the new shareholder who brought the greenhouse back to life

26
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.400
Someone 100 times more important than you

27
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000
Sister Wu, go call and ask the new shareholder

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.300
Is there something delayed?

29
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.466
Ok Mr. Wen

30
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.966
Sorry, I see.
