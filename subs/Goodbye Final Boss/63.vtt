00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.466
What nonsense are you talking about?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.400
Kensei

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.200
Wei Yan wants me to live in the master room

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.066
He wanted to kick me out and I wouldn't

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.500
And he tried to kill me?

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.400
Sword God, I'm so scared

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.566
I'm so scared.

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.700
I know you won't believe me.

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.100
I won't explain it anymore

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.666
In this life, you have to believe me

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.966
I'm not stupid, grandma.

12
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.766
How could I be stupid grandma?

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
What?

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.200
He's jealous that I'm pregnant

15
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.400
He tried to throw me out.

16
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.800
He said that again

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.200
You

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.466
Since you want to force a cautious divorce

19
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.233
Then why are you targeting me everywhere?

20
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.600
If you want to play hard to get

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.733
Then I beg you to change someone

22
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.900
I don't have time to play with you

23
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.000
I divorced just for peace

24
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.200
I'm done.

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.666
I will no longer force the love that does not belong to me

26
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.266
But I will never let go of the mud in summer

27
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.333
I let you pay for grandma's life

28
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.200
You must be a fool.

29
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.433
You are still in the bloody mouth

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.300
Gotta give me a place to live

31
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.500
Before there is any substantive evidence

32
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.600
I wouldn't trust any company

33
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.200
I don't want this to happen again.

34
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.500
Li Yunchu apologized

35
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.433
He doesn't deserve my apology.

36
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.966
And if you don't divorce me

37
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.800
And let me stay here

38
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.966
I don't guarantee there will be a next time.

39
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:20.966
Member

40
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.566
Don't challenge my patience again and again

41
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.600
If I don't

42
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.166
You can only use my dad for love now
