00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.566
Speechless, wake up, where is this?

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.433
I'm going to give grandma the last ride

3
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.766
speechless

4
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.500
You are too weak now

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.600
Not easy to move too much

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.400
You won't even let me go to the last side of grandma

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.033
And now you pretend to care about me

8
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.433
Mr. Liu, what are you going to do?

9
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.566
Put it here.

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.033
I beg you not to go

11
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.700
No one in the world loves me

12
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.566
You go I don't want to see you again

13
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.600
Pardon me?

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.200
Xi Shi said

15
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.200
You are already a month pregnant

16
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.600
I have been to the mainland house together

17
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.066
That's why I found it impossible.

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.766
Impossible I will be responsible

19
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.400
I don't want you to be responsible.

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.966
Du Jingjing, you go, you go

21
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.566
Where are you going?

22
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.466
I'm going to find Zhou Yinhe

23
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.966
I have something to ask him

24
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.233
What do you need him for?

25
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.300
China

26
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.166
You still doubt me

27
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.366
You still don't believe me?

28
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.166
Then I won't continue.

29
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.966
That being the case

30
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.466
What you say is what you say

31
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.766
The child is not yours

32
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.766
You can let me go now

33
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.366
If the child is really his

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Then I can't let me bleed

35
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.900
You can stop me for a while

36
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.566
Can you stop me for the rest of my life?

37
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:50.666
Tell me the truth

38
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.833
Zhou Yupeng disappeared after being stopped by the hospital

39
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.633
Mine for you to find
