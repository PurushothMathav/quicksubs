00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.266
Why are you back?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.666
I'm sorry I shouldn't have replied to you.

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:06.866
used to it

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.366
positional false abortion

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.633
And I know all about wedding matching

6
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:17.800
It's been so long

7
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.733
I didn't even pay him off.

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.266
It's useless to know

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.600
Our marriage has come to an end

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.400
That is.

11
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.033
The problem between us is not just the distance below

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200
The most important thing is that you don't trust

13
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.100
Then I ask you

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.666
About grandma?

15
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:37.900
You until now

16
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.066
Do you still think I'm the murderer of grandma?

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.200
I will go

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.033
You until now

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.266
I can't say for sure that it's not you.

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.400
To put it bluntly, you don't believe it.

21
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.366
Do you want to see

22
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.066
Greenhouse when you were a child

23
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.900
It's my business.

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.633
Your father will never fail to come to the company

25
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.166
What's causing the greenhouse is death

26
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.266
But

27
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.833
But what?

28
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.600
As long as a big company buys greenhouses

29
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.700
Greenhouses can still come back to life

30
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.166
Where can I find a big company?

31
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.833
Clean up the mess in the greenhouse

32
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.833
You are married to the president of the Lu Group

33
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.200
You can continue to play if necessary

34
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.266
Lu Jinshan, I will figure it out myself

35
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.300
You go
