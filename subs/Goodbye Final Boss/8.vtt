1
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.400
Me too.

2
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:11.166
I'll divorce him when the time is right

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.300
cautious

4
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.066
When you read this letter

5
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.500
Maybe I'm gone.

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.966
Late Afterlife

7
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.833
Unclog my love for you

8
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.433
There is no cure.

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.300
I'm dead.

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.200
Maybe it can also fulfill you and the next place

11
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.666
It's not hard and wrong to know

12
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.000
What are you doing?

13
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.033
What are you playing?

14
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.066
speak

15
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.900
I'm just looking for someone to teach me a lesson

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.766
The doctor who doesn't know the sky and the earth?

17
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.966
You are distressed to the point of death

18
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.666
Do you not believe anything I say?

19
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.233
Can you replace it with something new and mature?

20
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.266
Come for a while

21
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.266
Just ask yourself

22
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.800
Then you treat me as a mustang

23
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.800
I don't care if you die

24
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.700
I wish you would suffer my grief

25
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.800
Eat the consequences

26
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.700
If you don't care at all

27
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.066
Why are you still coming to me?

28
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.700
Why don't you remember?

29
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.866
Obligation to travel with you, Mrs. Lu

30
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:54.900
Charge forward isn't it him?

31
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.300
Shut up. Your body is stronger than your mouth
