00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.900
In fact, it is okay not to clarify.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.466
I don't mind spreading rumors about you.

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.266
Just forget it.

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.500
I don't want to spread rumors with an ordinary friend

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.500
It's like I'm flirty

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.733
Isn't it?

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.066
If you don't want to worry, you can go first.

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.200
Well, let me clarify.

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.800
Do you really not consider me?

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.166
Forget it.

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.233
Let's be friends.

12
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.833
Then I'll ask next time

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.566
The host, Fu Yunxi, is downstairs

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.366
Master Su has allowed Fu to be downstairs for more than an hour

15
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.600
Master Su has allowed Fu to be downstairs for more than an hour

16
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.400
You are so eventful

17
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.666
I just said it casually

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.066
Is this person sick?

19
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.566
Standing downstairs without calling

20
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.966
Are you waiting for a tour?

21
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.900
Why didn't you call me?

22
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.466
I understand that you are going abroad tomorrow

23
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.033
I'm afraid to disturb your rest.

24
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.366
Come on. Why?

25
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.600
About you saying goodbye

26
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.700
I don't agree with that.

27
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.766
And?

28
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.800
Continue to be your little lover

29
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.900
Yes, you say it with your conscience

30
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.866
I really only consider you as family

31
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.133
What top gifter have you seen?

32
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.633
Take it as an ancestor

33
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.166
But even so

34
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.766
It still doesn't change the fact that I'm just your ex

35
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:51.200
No? Then you can tell me.

36
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.500
I have never been in love

37
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.200
I know I'm emotionally flawed. I

38
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.600
I don't want you to worry.

39
00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:10.900
I said and then what?

40
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.766
Lover succeeds

41
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.100
Even if we are together in the future

42
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.600
I'm still a lover, aren't I?

43
00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:23.466
Then I'll pursue you again, okay?

44
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.833
you

45
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.066
Please give me another chance.

46
00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.000
I'll think about it.
