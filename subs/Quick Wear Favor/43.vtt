00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.300
Mr. Qing

2
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.966
This is looking at Nuannuan

3
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.066
Oh my cousin

4
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.433
Hey, I don't know if it's a book or not.

5
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.833
He's fine with everything.

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.400
I just don't love myself

7
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.766
Last time we met

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.200
He actually drives a Rolls Royce

9
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.466
You said he was an assistant to a young actor

10
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.600
How can I afford to drive a car like this?

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.466
Dressed up for this occasion again today

12
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.300
I'm afraid it's not a big money, right?

13
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.400
Mr. Qing

14
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.366
I do wish him well.

15
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.300
But I have to be fair

16
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.233
He doesn't deserve you.

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.900
You really want him to be well, of course.

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.566
Forgot to tell you

19
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.166
The last car he drove

20
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.400
It's mine.

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.500
Long time no see.

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.966
The Normans. I've been following them

23
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.800
I heard there was a little girl in their family

24
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.433
As soon as he returned to China, he became a grassroots company leader

25
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.800
I knew it was you.

26
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.733
Then when my dad asked you to settle the bill

27
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.033
Why are you admitting defeat?

28
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.700
Are you acting? Of course I'll pay for your eye rights

29
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.400
I just returned to China these two days.

30
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.600
You have been in the country

31
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.066
If it is convenient, can you?
