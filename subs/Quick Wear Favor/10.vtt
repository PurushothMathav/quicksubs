00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.566
The side is obviously not good at

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.766
He is the magician of this world

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.066
Because the charm just happened to fall on him

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.300
So even if the teenager is a false white lotus

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.633
She is still the daughter of charm in this world

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.166
So the original owner is used as cannon fodder

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.066
Even if there was a good hand

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.600
Eventually, it will also go to a dead end for various reasons

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.100
Girl of luck vs. villain girl two, right?

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.833
Hmm, that's interesting

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.066
Friendly reminder

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.333
If the mission fails

13
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.866
You can never be resurrected again

14
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.466
Host business is difficult

15
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.633
What's the matter with you?

16
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.066
You can't do this right.

17
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.600
In the original plot

18
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.666
The original owner is also deliberately doing bad things here.

19
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.233
Let the boss quarrel at night

20
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.666
This is also the beginning of the dark night

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.400
Do you know how much these drinks cost?

22
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, what's the use?

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.800
The purchase price of this case of wine is 888, so hurry up and lose money.

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.100
The salary of goods and goods for one day is only 200.

25
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.266
I still have to take my mom to the doctor to help

26
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.366
Manager, I really don't give a damn

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.000
Stop

28
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
Just some money

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.633
Don't be dirty

30
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.666
give

31
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.400
Count your life

32
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.200
come

33
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.266
why

34
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:24.000
Are you okay? I just saved you.

35
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is how you treat your benefactor

36
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.966
Tell me what you want me to do this time

37
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:32.066
You are like this, what else can you do for me?

38
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:36.900
Well, you can work for me in the future

39
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.500
So you're mine

40
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.066
Okay, this is what I pay you

41
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.266
You just have to listen to me from now on, understand

42
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:53.333
Congratulations to the host

43
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.600
Vietnam and blackened values reduced by 5%

44
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.666
Real-time blackening value 75%

45
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.166
Oh, I see.

46
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.566
What do you need me to do now?

47
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:03.400
OK

48
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.100
I'll give you a few days off because you're sick.

49
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.800
Go back and rest
