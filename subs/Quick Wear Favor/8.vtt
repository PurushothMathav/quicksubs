00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:04.066
Obviously you will return the necklace to that little bastard tomorrow

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.700
Mom, you went to see your aunt today

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.133
Your aunt is also swollen and fat

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.666
I thought I was really married to a rich man

5
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.600
Mom

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.300
How about we return this high-quality imitation to him?

7
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.500
Yes, give this back to him

8
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.800
The old lady worked hard to take care of his parents for him

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.500
In the end, I was reluctant to give even a necklace

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.666
I wouldn't give it to him.

11
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.800
This is what he owes me

12
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:45.900
warm

13
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.600
Some people say you are pretending to be rich and beautiful

14
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.700
He also said that you live in the old dawn

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.166
The drivers who connect you are all monthly rental cars.

16
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.566
true or false?

17
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.233
Oh sleep, this rumor is so fast

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.066
host

19
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.600
Quickly show your balance and light up their dog eyes

20
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.066
No hurry I'm guilty of my idea

21
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.800
Who is talking nonsense?

22
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.566
Are the rumors true?

23
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.333
What are you pretending to be, poor man?

24
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.600
I don't want to play with him anymore, neither do I

25
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.833
Go and finally take the opportunity to get rid of them

26
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.866
The ears will be close in the future
