00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.900
Vice President Agreement Hello, please take a look.

2
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.500
Let him rest at night

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.966
It's a little lover after all

4
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.066
Many things are still

5
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.866
It's better to make it clear at the outset

6
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.566
To avoid future disputes

7
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:25.966
OK

8
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.466
husband

9
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.400
I'm going home tonight.

10
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.533
It's my birthday today.

11
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.000
He's leaving

12
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.866
But I'm definitely going back to the old house for my birthday today

13
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.966
It's impossible to bring him to my mother

14
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.700
Kohler

15
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.866
Brother wishes you a birthday

16
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.766
Happy birthday to you.

17
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.833
Well, congratulations, you're another year older.

18
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.066
Shut up if you don't know how to speak.

19
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.400
Hey brother this

20
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:45.233
Hey brother, I have said all these auspicious words

21
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.700
Do you have to give me some?

22
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.800
You ask me for money for my birthday

23
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.766
What about the face?

24
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.133
Brother, aren't you richer than me?

25
00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.966
I don't care if you don't give it to me

26
00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:01.466
I'll tell Sister Nuan how stingy you are

27
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:07.600
brother

28
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.333
Will it be alright in the future?

29
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.466
Don't come to me

30
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:17.366
Asi, this is the cake your mother made for you by hand

31
00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:18.900
Do you like it?

32
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.300
I like it, thank you mom.

33
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.866
Do less of these things in the future

34
00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:29.166
Just let him buy it.

35
00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:32.500
You don't want the cake I made for you

36
00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:34.500
It's not me, it's just Axi.

37
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.500
So many years

38
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.700
Can't you forgive mom?

39
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.500
No, it's long gone.

40
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.366
Help! Help!

41
00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:50.800
Let me out!

42
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.700
How dare you kidnap me?

43
00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:53.733
After I go out

44
00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:57.200
I must make you die

45
00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.200
Help! Help!

46
00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:06.900
Mom, wait a minute.

47
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.666
I'll go out and call someone for you.
