1
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.966
Thank you for buying me a closet full of new clothes

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.300
Pretty, huh?

3
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.433
It just broke up.

4
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.433
Isn't this canary too clingy?

5
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.466
Except for money and body

6
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.666
Others are not dangerous

7
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.766
Sheng Nuan's homework was sent to me and sorted out uniformly.

8
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.666
I don't understand why because someone reported it.

9
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.200
He has to do it all over again

10
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.333
The whistleblower said that Shengnuan

11
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.800
You did the homework this time.

12
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.866
It was Yao Shanshan who reported you

13
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.400
teacher

14
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.233
Did you do the homework yourself this time?

15
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.933
Of course, I heard that someone reported me.

16
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.066
I don't know if there is any evidence provided?

17
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.066
I'll take care of the whistleblower.

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.566
But the teacher wants you to understand

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.833
with

20
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.466
False excellence

21
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.800
Teachers prefer to see your true level

22
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.100
Only in this way, it doesn't matter, teacher.

23
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.666
I can adapt the last assignment live.

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.866
on-site adaptation

25
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.900
OK
