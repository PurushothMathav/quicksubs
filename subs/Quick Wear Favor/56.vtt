00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.000
The villain is ugly

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.166
The music we made

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.033
That's the theme song of the movie.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.266
Who is Zhu Yue?

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.766
He was a beautiful man.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.433
You see what actor you already know this is

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.566
Isn't it just a supporting role?

8
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.366
Isn't that just a supporting role?

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.366
Supporting actors also determine the quality of the show

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.100
Hurry up and find it again

11
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.433
Can you act?

12
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.600
Will not

13
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.533
Isn't the host acting all the time?

14
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.233
Do you want to act? No

15
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.500
So let me tell you a scene.

16
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.300
You go first

17
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.700
Student Sheng, why don't you play it?

18
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.266
Also let the director give up

19
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.033
humble

20
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.566
So I want you to play a state

21
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.966
The surface is cloudy and windy

22
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.666
It's actually a peak star

23
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.400
That is, you dare to do anything

24
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.700
But you have to try your best to pretend that you are usually

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.933
It's normal.

26
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.733
OK

27
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.966
Ah pay attention

28
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.700
It's a mantle, not a mental illness

29
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.233
It's not bipolar.

30
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.300
Is that so?

31
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:37.600
That's right, that's right.

32
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:41.700
Look, this is the master I want, that's him
