00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:08.033
Hmph, it's really cheap for him to break that leg

2
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.700
Aren't you scared?

3
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.533
What am I afraid of?

4
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.266
I have a gun, he doesn't.

5
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.166
Do I dare to shoot them?

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.866
If they dare to shoot, I will directly BB

7
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.800
You are too

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.100
A person running to that kind of place makes trouble for me

9
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.833
Is life so worthless?

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.400
Is it valuable? It's valuable to me

11
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.066
Do you think I'm unreliable now?

12
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.000
Or do I want to dump me after using it up?

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.266
I don't want anything to do with me anymore, no

14
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.233
you

15
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.133
Did something happen at home?

16
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.366
Oh, I went to your place.

17
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.666
You've been empty

18
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.466
You're not sick.

19
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.566
He's been calling in sick.

20
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.566
I'm fine, it's none of your business

21
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.800
Anyway, don't worry, I still have money.

22
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.966
Yan Nan and her mother's surgery should have cost a lot of money

23
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.100
Buying a necklace should be enough, right?

24
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.366
Sure enough, second-hand is worthless

25
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.000
But the surgery fee should be enough

26
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.300
No.

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.566
Are you waiting there? What are you doing here?

28
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.433
This is what you call money

29
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.066
Isn't surgery money?

30
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.600
That's more valuable than money, and I

31
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.200
Oh, don't worry.

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.000
Enough money, I still have a lot

33
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.033
No. That's all.

34
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.100
Let's go somewhere else tonight.

35
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.433
It's not safe anymore.

36
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.266
Host please note

37
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.766
Shangyue's brother, Baron Feld

38
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.300
They also sent people to hunt down Shang Yue

39
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.333
What's the matter? The person staring at you is coming too.

40
00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.566
Two groups of killers are expected to arrive in half an hour

41
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:04.433
What a double suicide

42
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.166
Am I still alive?

43
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.000
I have an idea.
