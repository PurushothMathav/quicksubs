00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.466
Very warm

2
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.233
How do you think about it?

3
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.400
Fu allows

4
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.800
Actually, I'm not as good as you think.

5
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.366
I am selfish

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.266
I often put my own preferences and interests first

7
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.000
Such me

8
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.600
Can you accept it? I can.

9
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.300
I will not accommodate your mother because of you

10
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.100
If he doesn't respect me

11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.433
I will fight back

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.700
reasonable

13
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.100
I promise.

14
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.833
I won't let you suffer any more

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.166
You just now

16
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.766
Saying so much about yourself is not good

17
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.166
I want to send me a good person card.

18
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:58.833
Right?

19
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.966
You said you would consider being with me

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.500
actually

21
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.200
You didn't even think about it, did you?

22
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.266
The reason why you have this meal with me

23
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.566
Rather than with that person

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.266
I want to send me away early

25
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.600
Right?

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.266
Really?

27
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.166
You are a liar

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.400
No.

29
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.233
I just feel the need to make it clear to you in advance

30
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.600
In case of time or wrong version

31
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.166
You regret it again

32
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.600
I won't regret it.

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.800
you

34
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.233
What did that mean?

35
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.833
What do you mean by worrying that I will regret it?

36
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.400
i

37
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.500
I won't do it.

38
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.400
I'm the moment to worry

39
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm afraid you will suddenly regret it one day

40
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.233
Don't want me

41
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.833
Falling in love is definitely different from taking care of it.

42
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:09.566
I don't want to take care of it.

43
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.300
We can end it anytime.

44
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.200
After all, I don't owe you anything.

45
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:15.366
If you are in love

46
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:18.700
We need to be responsible for each other, right?

47
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.400
That's it.

48
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.466
We start over.

49
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.300
This time it's love.

50
00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:27.233
No one is allowed to go back

51
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.400
OK
