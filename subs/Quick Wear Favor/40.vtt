00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.633
What happened back then was my fault

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.033
I will not.

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.133
I was wrong about what happened back then

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.566
It's all over

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.166
The past.

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.666
Let's forget about it.

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.700
It's all over

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.700
Did he forget about me too?

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.700
Why isn't he talking?

10
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.800
He's still so good-looking.

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.166
No, it looks more manly now

12
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.700
Oh no no no

13
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.633
If you look any further, it will fall again.

14
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.900
that

15
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.833
If it's okay

16
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.633
I'll go first

17
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.466
Leave a WeChat message

18
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.466
Contact often in the future

19
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.400
hot

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.033
Is the economy tight?

21
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.266
No, I'm an intern at my family's computing company.

22
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.366
Have to keep a low profile

23
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.166
Take your time

24
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.333
See you.

25
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.066
Hey

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.666
overcome

27
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.500
I think it's really good to be in love with him

28
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
He didn't seem to hate me at all.

29
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.766
Host

30
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.433
You seem to have some thieves' hearts towards him.

31
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.966
What did you say?

32
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
But

33
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.700
If only I could talk to him again

34
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.200
Yeah, but...

35
00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:08.466
It doesn't seem realistic

36
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.900
He doesn't look like the kind of guy who just steals grass

37
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.800
If he is still the one who had nothing

38
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.266
Just be poor.

39
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.500
Yeah, he's the boss now

40
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.400
It's a tough thing to do.

41
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:24.400
Nuannuan, where did you get this car from?

42
00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:27.300
Oops, rented

43
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.966
We can't lose the momentum when we come out to audition

44
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.366
Oh, but it's warm

45
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.200
I just saw the news today.

46
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.466
It is said that there are many first-line female celebrities in the country

47
00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.500
Come and try the role of Ah Cha

48
00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.166
You said I was a newcomer.

49
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.633
Oh, don't think so.

50
00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.600
As long as you have confidence in yourself

51
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.433
This role must be yours

52
00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.800
But

53
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.766
Oh, I'm here to accompany you for an interview

54
00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:54.200
You have to have confidence in yourself.

55
00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:01.233
Leave Me
