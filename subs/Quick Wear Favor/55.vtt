00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.700
So clingy

2
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.166
Little lover, no matter how hard my life is

3
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.900
I will tolerate this little problem

4
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.666
Teacher, this is your music

5
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.266
An old friend is looking for me

6
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.066
Give me a chance

7
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.033
Too bad it's still a little worse

8
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.100
You might want to try it.

9
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.633
Change the place where the deputy master connects slightly

10
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.166
Come on, come on, come and change it.

11
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.566
Students are afraid to learn from others

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.966
Music is about talent

13
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.666
No seniority restrictions

14
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.033
If you want to change it, you can change it.

15
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.500
teacher

16
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.500
Please listen to it.

17
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.700
Why haven't I seen you compose well before?

18
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.533
Because the quality was not turned on before

19
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:47.800
I'm hanging up

20
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.700
Learning is a process of accumulation

21
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.900
So it was all about learning.

22
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.200
Mainly because the teacher teaches well

23
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.666
Don't give me a top hat

24
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.300
You free up tomorrow and I'll take you somewhere
