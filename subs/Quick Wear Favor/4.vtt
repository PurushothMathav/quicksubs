00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Nice move.

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.133
This dress is the illegitimate child of an overseas wealthy family

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.966
Shang Yue got it right

4
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.166
This is what caused the original

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.966
The man behind the death of the Lord's father

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.900
Quality careful

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.166
This is a murderer without blinking an eye

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.633
Mainly not that he killed the original owner's father

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.566
The original owner will not get money from the rich family

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.400
Reduced to the city to sell himself for a living

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.800
Don't call the police

12
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.100
I'm not a bad person.

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.900
No one has the word bad written on their face

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.433
I am a school Xiao Yi

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.466
My father's illegitimate son

16
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.366
I hid from them to kill me

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.733
I can really tell, this guy

18
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.266
Obviously he is an illegitimate child

19
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.600
This is the key to the school hospital

20
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.600
Can you help me get my clothes?

21
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.700
Master Xuan has not offended last month at this time

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.600
Why don't you sell him a favor?

23
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:49.766
Wait a minute.

24
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.266
Here's what you want.

25
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.866
Okay, if there's nothing else, I'll go first.

26
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:56.966
What happened today

27
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.333
It's okay, I'll pretend I haven't seen you

28
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.266
Just pretend you haven't seen me

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.666
No wonder it looks familiar

30
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.866
It was the Normans

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.766
From the outback where Norman was ostensibly courting me

32
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.033
If I could hold his daughter in my hand

33
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.966
Then he has something to do with most of my idiots

34
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.766
I'll still be somewhat reliable
