00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.833
Nuannuan, you are here, I was looking for you

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.166
My mom asked me to give you the necklace.

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.500
Please pass it on to your aunt.

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.433
Not this one

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.966
Nuannuan, what do you mean?

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.800
If you want to pay it back, pay back the borrowed one

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.600
Nuannuan, this is obviously the one that borrowed from my aunt.

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.100
What are you doing?

9
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:29.866
Does it hurt?

10
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:30.666
warm

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.766
Why are you doing this?

12
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.200
Don't you want to pretend to be as weak as a fall?

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.333
I will fulfill you

14
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.266
Take a look.

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.566
Now everyone thinks you're innocent and weak

16
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.966
You don't thank me

17
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.433
What are you doing?

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.833
Apologize

19
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.766
warm

20
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.533
This is the necklace my mother borrowed from my aunt.

21
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.300
You're saying it's not this one now

22
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400
Where do you want me to find it for you?

23
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.300
Let me apologize to him

24
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.866
How old are you?

25
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:07.266
In fact, whether it is things or people

26
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.066
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

27
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.566
I will be poverty alleviation

28
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.966
Hasn't this woman always liked me?

29
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.433
Are you alright?

30
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.333
What does Shengnuan mean?

31
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.700
He doesn't like school grass

32
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.333
It should be, have you forgotten?

33
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.100
Last time he said Gu

34
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.433
Big school grass is like a waste when playing basketball

35
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.066
I guess he looks too useless.

36
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.800
So I don't like him anymore.
