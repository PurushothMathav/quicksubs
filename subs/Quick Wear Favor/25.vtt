00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.166
Old trouble

2
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.033
People haven't left yet

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.633
Handsome guy go to me

4
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.166
I don't come back often

5
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.166
It's safe.

6
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.266
You can rest assured.

7
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.700
Take a seat

8
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.366
Les Norman is in a coma

9
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.533
The legal heir is better than the daily return

10
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.033
Why is Stephen still chasing you?

11
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.800
Maybe his situation is more difficult

12
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.233
I only offer the help I can.

13
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.433
Also, if your uncle's people come to the door

14
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.066
I will not confront them head-on

15
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.100
Never do unreasonable things

16
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.866
That's because you can't take care of yourself, right?

17
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.800
Nice brain

18
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.000
In light of you

19
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.100
Don't go to class recently

20
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.466
Okay?

21
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.466
Fortunately, I was prepared

22
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:44.700
There were tens of thousands of penguins and tens of thousands of penguins.

23
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.366
Customer Service Customer Service

24
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.066
Are the guys staring at me still there?

25
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.833
They couldn't find you for days on end and pulled out

26
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.966
Auntie
