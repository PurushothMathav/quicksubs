1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.800
No, he's already here.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.666
Miss Mu

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.800
Why are you here? I'm Zhao Yuntian, Mr. Zhao

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.166
We've met before.

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.366
I didn't expect to see you here again

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.766
I thought you were here to find me

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.233
But it doesn't matter.

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.133
I find you the same

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.966
Why was Miss Mu so proactive towards him?

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.300
Zhao Gongzi, don't you know?

11
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.200
This is his employment number.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.866
What? How is that possible?

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.000
Miss Mu is the first name in the Shangjing family

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
Heir to the next family

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.500
There's nobody in Kyoto like that.

16
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.300
Stick with this big talker

17
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.666
Zhao Yuntian, you are happy

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:38.300
When will it be your turn to intervene in my business?

19
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.800
Miss Huo, I didn't mean that

20
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.366
Just another time

21
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.200
There is no need for the Zhao family to exist anymore

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.200
Just in time for you to come

23
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.800
Help me check the oxidation of this sheet.

24
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.200
Where did this come from?

25
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.100
Miss Wu

26
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.000
This is a birthday present for me in the early morning.

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.366
Is there a problem?

28
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.300
This order name is the previous yuan order.

29
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.900
Not only no problem

30
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.833
It is a female ordinary leading edge single.

31
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.100
What Miss Fu

32
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.266
This is real money from Dan

33
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.566
Are you kidding me?

34
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.700
Well, it's rejecting me

35
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.566
If you still don't believe

36
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.166
Encountered a drug testing agency

37
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.433
No, wow.

38
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.200
Why did you eat it, spit it out

39
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.166
If it's fake, it's in trouble

40
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.033
I believe that silver deposits will not harm me
