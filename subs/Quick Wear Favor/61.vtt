2
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.366
It's been over a year

3
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.300
Why did you suddenly take the initiative to contact me?

4
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.100
Let's get married.

5
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.833
Why did you choose me?

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.833
My mom likes you better

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.433
And your family is very scholarly.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.100
You have a good family style and a docile personality

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.466
It's easy to get along with

10
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.433
Suitable for marriage

11
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.000
You'd better find someone else

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.766
Which sentence is wrong?

13
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.100
How are you doing?

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.066
I'm doing well, better than ever

15
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.800
What's your business?

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.800
husband

17
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.466
I'm going to the cast tomorrow

18
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.466
How did you learn to cut first and then play

19
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.000
No, I don't agree.

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.866
No

21
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.766
I can't tell you to go, can't you hear me? Get out

22
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.500
Someone else's golden silk is always on call

23
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.133
This is to learn to film and work besides going to bed

24
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.066
lazier than me

25
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.333
No, I can't.

26
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.733
If you go filming

27
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.600
Then don't I go home alone every day?

28
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.300
Are you not weaned yet?

29
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.966
Just talk

30
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.266
Who are you scolding?

31
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.833
I'll just go for a few days and I won't stop

32
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.433
Oh, you said it earlier

33
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.000
What scene are you going to test this time?

34
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:52.033
I can invest in you and add some drama

35
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:54.733
Hello

36
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:56.700
Hello

37
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.233
Can't sleep

38
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.566
Push me for what?

39
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.466
I'm going to push it again.
