1
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.633
Dr. Lauren's surgery fee is all settled

2
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.300
Perfect

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.700
Hey, by the way, customer service.

4
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.966
What happened to Harajuku's father?

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.133
report host

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:14.666
Leslie

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.866
Norman will be at a banquet in three days

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.266
Drink poisoned wine

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.266
sudden death

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.666
What happened to this man

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.000
Determine my place in this world

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.300
No, I have to stop this

13
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.766
warm

14
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.433
What's wrong with Nuannuan?

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.466
Mom, I had a nightmare.

16
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.366
I'm so scared.

17
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.666
Don't be afraid

18
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.166
What were you dreaming about?

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.766
I dreamed that my father was at a night party

20
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.433
Drank a glass of poisoned wine

21
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.800
He fell to the ground and turned yellow

22
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.066
He is wearing a blue dress

23
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.866
Then covered in blood

24
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.633
I'm really scared

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.433
I just picked out the blue dress for Leslie

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.566
Is it a dream of jade?

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Baby is not afraid

28
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.666
This is just a dream

29
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.300
Your brother will be fine

30
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.866
No, I have to tell Lao Jin ASAP

31
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.466
report host

32
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.733
Leslie has received the message

33
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.900
Concerned about the poisoned wine incident

34
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.600
That's fine.

35
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.466
As long as he can avoid this poisoning incident

36
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.900
Maybe my ending will also be reversed

37
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:38.866
Hey

38
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.166
Sorry, I haven't found you yet.

39
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:44.866
Thanks.

40
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.266
I heard that you saved the scene by asking your cousin to go to the filming

41
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.800
That day at the top of the stairs

42
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.133
Pretending to be bullied by you with bitter meat

43
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.066
You see it.

44
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.500
I not only see

45
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.500
Also photographed

46
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.200
Want it?

47
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.633
But

48
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.000
You promise me something

49
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.700
What's wrong?

50
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.600
I owe it first

51
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.700
No, nothing else.

52
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.966
I don't care what other people think of me.

53
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.900
I will not change the way others see me

54
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.466
Law at an unknown cost

55
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.666
I can't tell you're excited

56
00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.833
If there's nothing else, I'll go first

57
00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:30.200
This little girl seems to like that little girl with the surname Cool

58
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.633
young

59
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.000
I didn't get any better.
