It was you

2
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.366
I also heard Miss Shen recording the song in it just now.

3
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.666
Of the three songs, I like you better

4
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:52.100
Thank you, it is also fate to meet in a foreign country.

5
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.800
Miss Shen, can you treat me to a meal?

6
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.866
I happen to know some good restaurants

7
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.833
OK.

8
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.700
Wow, men are talented and women look.

9
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.700
Oh no male appearance female talent

10
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:10.800
Not right either

11
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.866
It should be a match made in heaven, really?

12
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.700
I beg that person to kill me

13
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.333
Let's help everyone

14
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.900
So happy, bah face

15
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
Where are you?

16
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.200
I am in a country

17
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.133
The theme song written for the League of Assassins final was selected

18
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.833
Came temporarily to record

19
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.800
Since you don't fight me

20
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.000
Please explain this photo to me.

21
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.566
Now I have something to come back and chat in person

22
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.366

23
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.966
