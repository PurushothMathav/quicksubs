1
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.866
They wouldn't let me live

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.166
Can't live

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.466
Classmate, don't be impulsive

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.100
Customer service, what's the situation with him?

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.566
Zhao Yingzi fell into online lending

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.500
The interest is owed 100,000 not paid

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.700
Then the person who was loaned online sent the nude photos to the school sticker.

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.066
I don't want to commit suicide

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.366
Swallow, don't be impulsive

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.333
I can help you.

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.966
You can't help me.

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.300
I borrowed 8,000.

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.800
Just 8,000

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.633
It's 100,000 now

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.400
My parents don't know about it yet.

16
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.833
I have no face to see them

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.166
Ah, ah, ah.

18
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.500
Don't move, I can't hold it anymore

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.966
Let go

20
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.400
I'm not in debt anyway

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.933
I don't want to live anymore.

22
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.400
Isn't it just 100,000 dollars?

23
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.300
I'll pay it back for you.

24
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.900
Don't lie.

25
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.233
You are a cat brand white rich beauty

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.366
You trust me.

27
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.866
I'll pass it on to you when you come up

28
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.433
Are you all right?

29
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.800
Scared me to death

30
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.266
How big is it?

31
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.633
You really transferred money to me.

32
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.700
How did you get this injury?

33
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:29.900
A fool

34
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.966
That sesame lady jumped off the building at 12

35
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.266
I'm going to be brave

36
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.300
I think he's stupid and want to save him

37
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.800
Do you have any anti-social personality?

38
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.266
People are just stupid and don't deserve to die

39
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.133
Okay, I haven't touched the water in the past two days

40
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.266
You should also pay attention

41
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.233
Got it.

42
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.166
Here we go.

43
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.500
The Norman family has always been cold-blooded

44
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.666
I didn't expect this Miss Norman

45
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:02.900
There is still this tender intestine

46
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.966
Is the information different from mine?
