00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.933
Ouch.

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.300
If there is money on the computer to treat his mother

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.866
It won't be blackened.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.800
How am I supposed to give him the money?

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.466
It seems that when a rich woman can't spend money, she is also very distressed

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.200
Oops, shut up

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.000
Yes.

8
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.366
change your life against the sky

9
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.166
When will the name be changed?

10
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.833
Is the big brother game linking? Signal

11
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.400
I want to reach level 85 as soon as possible

12
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.366
Check out 3,000 first.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.566
Well, except for boosting

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.266
I also need to play with you sometimes

15
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.700
The fee for accompanying the game is paid in advance, and you will make up for it if it is not enough in the future.

16
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.666
At least I have the money now to take my mom to the hospital

17
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.800
I heard that the cast and crew will shoot the stars when they have time.

18
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.966
Go and see

19
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.833
I remember now.

20
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.166
In the original plot

21
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.600
The citizens were discovered by the film director on this day

22
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.466
Enter the entertainment industry

23
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:28.066
I remember that the original owner also went to join in the fun at that time

24
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.100
Forget it, classmate

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.500
I am the assistant director of the Wind Blows Crew Korean Fang

26
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.100
We happen to be missing a supporting role for a character right now

27
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.166
Are you interested in coming and trying it out?

28
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.633
Insomnia should be auditioning now, right?

29
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:41.566
overcome

30
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.333
Do I really want cannon fodder girls now?

31
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.466
Call me system
