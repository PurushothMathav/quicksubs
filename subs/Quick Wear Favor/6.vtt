00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.366
How come?

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.933
Ah, he was drugged!

3
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.200
Please drive faster

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.100
Young people really know how to play

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.200
How dare he bite me!

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.966
Who are you?

7
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.466
It's over, Fanfan, this is going to hold a grudge

8
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.400
Do good deeds without leaving a name

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.500
Go to sleep

10
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.500
So this elementary school is quite handsome

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.800
Boy, saving lives is manual labor.

12
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.133
Customer service, if only you could help me move people

13
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.100
I said my name is the system.

14
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.066
Didn't I just borrow you two sets to save trouble?

15
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.900
Who are you showing your face to?

16
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.366
The jewelry my aunt borrowed last time hasn't been returned yet

17
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.700
Why don't you return the last one first?

18
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.100
How about borrowing a new one?

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.066
And I'm none of your business

20
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.766
Little bastard, you are his holy year mother

21
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.333
After falling down in the original owner's house

22
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.866
Steal the original owner gesture jewelry

23
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.466
Shameless bullying orphan girl

24
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.100
I am close to your brother

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800
Filial piety for you every night

26
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.966
That's how you repay us.

27
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.766
Come and comment

28
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.166
Absent when supporting the elderly

29
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.766
Now I'm back and I'm back and I'm taking the house

30
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:25.100
You are so cold-blooded to your sister-in-law

31
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.500
This guy?

32
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:30.800
If you climb a high branch, you will look down on your family

33
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.733
Oh, you can't forget your roots

34
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.566
It's just my own family searching like this

35
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:40.266
Hmph, you two still want to fight me

36
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.466
Play house fight with me

37
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.233
It's really a tiger

38
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.633
Take me as hello Kitty
