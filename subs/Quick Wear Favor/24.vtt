00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.900
Last time

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.400
Did you take me to the hospital?

3
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.600
It was you who moved first

4
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.533
It's not that you bit me first before I moved my hand

5
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.666
That was him?

6
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.600
Those previous words were said when my brain was spinning

7
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.100
I know now that I was wrong, really.

8
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.100
You can't just because I've been stupid before

9
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.633
I'm sentenced to death, right?

10
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.433
What I said last time

11
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.266
Are you sincere?

12
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.400
It's all true.

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.200
If I'm lying, I gain 5kg

14
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.766
Hey

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.566
Ye Nanheng, I find you so nice

16
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800
I like you more and more

17
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.000
Can you be serious?

18
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.166
I'm saying it from the bottom of my heart

19
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.166
Last time

20
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.200
Why do you want to live in my house?

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.700
Ah!

22
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.366
My mom is away on a business trip and I'm scared alone

23
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.166
I'm just saying it casually, don't take it seriously.

24
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.866
If no one is home

25
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.600
Would you like to come over for dinner?

26
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.966
I can go if I want.

27
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.433
I would love it.

28
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.066
Wow

29
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.833
What a considerate man

30
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.500
If you are really afraid and don't dislike my family

31
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.000
Can you stay at my house?

32
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.366
Forget it. Forget it.

33
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.766
I was kidding.

34
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.633
How awkward it is to live in someone else's house

35
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.000
Thanks.

36
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:08.700
Host, how many people are there in your house?

37
00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:09.700
Friendly reminder

38
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.700
The driver of the car you are sitting in now

39
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.933
With those people

40
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.466
What did you just say?

41
00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.666
Next time, when I get tired of it, I'll pack it up.

42
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.866
Does it take time to load data?

43
00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:25.766
OK

44
00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:27.266
master

45
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.800
Why don't you stop for a second? I want to get some roasted chestnuts.

46
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.366
Thank you.

47
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.666
Everyone wants you to come out
