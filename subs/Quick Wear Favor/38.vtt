00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.533
Master, didn't you say you wanted to see it?

2
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.366
Is there a technical exchange meeting for the branch?

3
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.600
And here they go.

4
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.200
Come on.

5
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.033
Miss Ivy's report was excellent

6
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.466
Let's be honest

7
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.966
The price of your company's intelligent products is too expensive.

8
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.433
What's the use of more functions?

9
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.766
It's not very cost-effective.

10
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.066
Mr. Tang

11
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.566
In our industry, it's always been about sex.

12
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.900
They don't care about value for money.

13
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.100
After all

14
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.366
The cost of even one power outage maintenance is very high.

15
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.133
And our products

16
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.800
It can greatly reduce the probability of power failure maintenance

17
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.633
Miss Ivy

18
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.166
young

19
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.900
If this meal is done

20
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.066
It's got to be amazing.

21
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.600
It doesn't matter if it works or not.

22
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.900
I didn't think about it that much.

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.766
How can you not want to?

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.800
In the workplace, some people lack that wind

25
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.466
Seized the opportunity

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.200
It was shaken to the top

27
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.833
And what about me?

28
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.633
Willing to give young people a chance

29
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.400
It seems that Miss Ivy

30
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.466
Not paying much attention to this project

31
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.766
Is Mr. Tang sober?

32
00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.000
Miss Ivy

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.033
Please respect yourself.

34
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:01.600
What's wrong with Mr. Tan?

35
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.833
What's wrong?

36
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.100
This is a good employee of your company

37
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900
He even introduced me to the products he made for me

38
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.800
Due to suggestion

39
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.400
After I rejected him, I hummed

40
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.033
He was so angry

41
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.466
Say what's going to ruin my fertility

42
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.033
Who is right and who is wrong

43
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.866
We can adjust the monitoring.

44
00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:25.666
Really can't

45
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.366
We'll call the police

46
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:28.533
This little thing

47
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:29.400
What monitoring to report?

48
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.966
Is Mr. Qing always there?
