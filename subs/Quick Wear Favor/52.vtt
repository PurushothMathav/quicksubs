00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.166
Why do you slander people?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.566
I slander you

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.300
Hey, what are you doing?

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.066
Slander you?

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.466
Go and report it!

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.100
Anyway, I tell you to take a picture and keep it at will.

7
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.366
Nuannuan, you're not hot yet

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.200
It's better to be nice as a person

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.300
Su Zhuo is the makeup artist this woman paid off

10
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:26.833
Yes

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.766
You wouldn't dare talk to me like that if I was on fire

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.600
Sheng Nuan, I am kind

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.800
Because there is no one who is too angry, right?

14
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.600
Domineering hum

15
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.266
You got that right.

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.066
Hey what are you doing

17
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.233
What are you doing?

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.466
Sheng Nuan

19
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:57.766
Wow

20
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.233
This is too hot

21
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.400
I should let those online simps

22
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.766
Look at him

23
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.900
Also little feral cat

24
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.700
I think he is a reed chicken

25
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.666
You don't know how domineering he looks backstage

26
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.666
Also bully me

27
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.133
This is too arrogant

28
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.066
This ugly look still looks good on the ceiling

29
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.500
Play me blind

30
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.366
Sister Nuan looks better than you in this way

31
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.066
How dare you be jealous?

32
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Sister Fu Yun, what do you mean? Are you calling me ugly?

33
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.066
That's right!

34
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.300
Sister Yun, don't be angry

35
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.700
They meant no harm.

36
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.266
Fake kindness, does my brother really like this one?

37
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:02.566
Hey, that's it for three days and two ends

38
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.566
But no one will tell me why
