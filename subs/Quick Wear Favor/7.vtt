00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.966
Mom, our family already has that money

2
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.500
It's not enough to maintain our own lives

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.800
Last time my aunt said that grandma was sick and needed money in the hospital

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.100
I borrowed money.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.966
But aren't we responsible for the medical expenses?

6
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.266
Now they want us to pay them back.

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.633
How can we have money?

8
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.266
Yes, sister-in-law

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.566
We get money for parents' sick pensions

10
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.366
There's no 600,000 here

11
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.133
How much do you want?

12
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.466
It's my aunt.

13
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.133
My mom didn't have many sets of jewelry

14
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.766
You borrow it every time.

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.200
Borrowed and not returned

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.200
Can't you leave him two sets?

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.400
You little bastard

18
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.566
Who said no?

19
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.166
This woman is too much

20
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.600
Forget about cheating money

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.200
And said my niece was a little bastard

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.900
Yeah, it's not a fuel-efficient lamp at first glance

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.133
Well, I'll give you this shit back tomorrow

24
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.166
It's like someone cares

25
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.400
My daughter is amazing

26
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.433
Really? You and I

27
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.366
Why did you hang up the bottle? What are you doing?

28
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.900
May I ask who sent me here?

29
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.133
A little girl

30
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.266
About your age.

31
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.500
I remember it was indeed a girl who saved me

32
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.300
That

33
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.866
How much is the medical bill?

34
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.100
Let me see.

35
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.300
987 That little girl has finished it for you.

36
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.200
Is it a name?

37
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.666
What happened today

38
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.000
Thank you. You're welcome.

39
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.300
Are you all right?

40
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.766
It's okay, I'll pass on the medical bills.

41
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.133
Someone saved Ye Nanheng

42
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.700
Also paid for medical expenses in advance

43
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.433
Ye Nanheng thought it was me
