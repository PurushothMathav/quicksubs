00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.166
Sir, what happened?

2
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.000
How long has it been since your stuff was moved?

3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.566
Two days ago

4
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.566
Miss Sheng said that those computers are to be used at school

5
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.000
Let someone move

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.566
What else did he say?

7
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.433
Didn't say anything.

8
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.366
moger

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.900
Vice President

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.400
Is the card for Mr. Sheng useful?

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.766
The deputy vice president newly put away the money he has not used the card

12
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.766
Brother, what happened?

13
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.666
Before Brother Shengnuan

14
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.000
Do you think you are in love with you?

15
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.633
It turned out that

16
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.066
He is just a little lover maintained by you

17
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.166
Or someone else's stand-in?

18
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.066
Also warned by mom

19
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.700
And Su Nian

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.666
So cruel what a stand-in

21
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.466
What on earth are you talking about?

22
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.966
Su Nian picked Suo Ma to find Shengnuan's

23
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.500
Yeah, why can't he get in?

24
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.200
Saint Nuan is just his stand-in

25
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.633
Who said that? Everyone says that.

26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.400
Said that your pursuit of Su Nian was rejected

27
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.000
I found a substitute who was somewhat similar to Su Nian

28
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.800
I come to place my love on Acacia

29
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.366
Isn't it?

30
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.900
Shen Short, listen to me

31
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:50.366
I denied my relationship

32
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.066
Fear of affecting your career

33
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.666
There's no double.

34
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.666
I didn't know my mom went to find you

35
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.200
I don't know how to send those Weibo.

36
00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:58.800
I'll place an order and apologize to you.

37
00:01:58.866 --> 00:01:59.666
Sorry.

38
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:01.700
You don't have to apologize.

39
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.233
I wanted to talk to you about the separation before

40
00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.000
Why is that?

41
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.900
The two of us weren't that kind in the first place

42
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.066
You must have an emotionally accountable relationship

43
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.400
You want to keep a canary?

44
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.566
I'm also looking for a temporary lover

45
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.433
Together at the right time

46
00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:22.800
If you want it to be over, you can get together and break up, right?

47
00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.866
Since it is a relationship between two people

48
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:27.433
It doesn't count if one person says it.

49
00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:29.000
I don't agree to separate
