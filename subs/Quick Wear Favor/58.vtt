00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.866
If you really have nothing to do

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.500
You can go downstairs in the garden

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.166
I'm your twenty-five boy now

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.300
You are saved, why don't I want to go inside?

5
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.066
Play it.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.733
The vice president has too much time to accompany me

7
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.133
I won't let anyone play with me

8
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.800
Didn't I reply to your message?

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.200
Just one

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.633
Who are you perfunctory to?

11
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.966
He's actually mad at me

12
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.566
That's how a lover should treat a top gifter

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.600
Am I too used to him?

14
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.433
Do you want to take the initiative later?

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.266
This disobedient little lover will be changed later

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.866
Why are you still angry?

17
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.800
I can't get used to ignoring him

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.166
people

19
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:05.300
It is true that men with thin mouths are the most ruthless

20
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.466
Humph and be angry

21
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.700
I'm still pissed

22
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.900
Not angry anymore

23
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.066
Who asked you to only reply to me one word every time you reply to a message?

24
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.666
Of course I'm not happy.

25
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.466
Is this explaining to me?

26
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.700
Count him sensible

27
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.700
In the future, you can't just reply to a girl's message with one word.

28
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.833
You know what?

29
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.633
Then you can't slap me in the face in the future

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.433
Don't be so stingy

31
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.100
That's only fair
