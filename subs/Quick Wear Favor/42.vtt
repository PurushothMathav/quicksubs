00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.800
That

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.700
I just stopped by.

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.566
Ah!

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.033
Ah, I ran out of that car and just gave it back to you.

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.633
Keep it in the car and drive first

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.066
I still have a lot in my garage

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.633
Hey, I'm just going to help my friend make a scene today.

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.266
Usually I just drive my little broken car

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.666
What kind of car do I have?

10
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.566
Next time, I can find a tourist to invite him to dinner

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.366
What a great opportunity.

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.400
Then I'll go first.

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.700
See you.

14
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:37.066
What was I unrealistically expecting?

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.366
Uh, OK, how are you?

16
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.166
Do you want to go up and rest for a while?

17
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.233
Hey, hey.

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.066
I was finally able to take him home justifiably

19
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.433
Come on.

20
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.466
What's wrong with you?

21
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.900
You've never been this weak before

22
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.066
Is it because of the headpoison last time?

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.966
But it doesn't matter anymore.

24
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.000
It's just that sometimes my stomach hurts a little bit.

25
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.266
Yeah.

26
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.966
You manage such a big stall alone

27
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.066
I definitely don't have time to rest well

28
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.566
Sorry.

29
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.166
Then hurry up

30
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.033
Not because I hate you

31
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:54.066
It's just that I didn't have the ability to protect you at that time

32
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
I'm afraid those who want to deal with me will hurt you

33
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.366
I thought you hated me

34
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:03.800
Hate me

35
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:05.866
It's all my fault

36
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.400
If it's okay

37
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.800
Well, it's a little late today.

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.400
Why don't you sleep here?

39
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.766
Go tomorrow

40
00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:16.233
Then

41
00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:18.033
Excuse me.

42
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.433
I have a party tomorrow

43
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.033
I'm going to sleep first

44
00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:23.500
Bye. Bye.

45
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.166
As long as I keep an eye on it

46
00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.400
Then he won't disappear again, will he?
