00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.200
No, why would I call him?

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.600
Whose little lover still needs to control the bandits?

3
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:14.966
Hello

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.000
I can't come back today, let's talk about it tomorrow

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.733
Why didn't you say three days?

6
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.766
It's afternoon after shooting, I'm too tired to drive

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.966
Then I'll send someone to pick you up.

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.766
No, I don't like riding in dirty cars

9
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.700
My car is fine, why is it dirty?

10
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.066
PR cannot

11
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.366
Vice President, wait a minute, I'll call

12
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.633
Mr. Gu, you are looking for me.

13
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.566
I want to know.

14
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.433
When did I have something to do with Rossini?

15
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.233
It's our job to apologize, Mr. Gu

16
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.000
It's just that you didn't say it before.

17
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.400
There are rumors of this kind of whimsy

18
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.366
The response is to flatter them

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
So are we going to respond positively this time?

20
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.900
Who made you respond?

21
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.700
Don't you know how to send a lawyer?

22
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.666
Oh, I understand.

23
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.400
I will contact the legal department to deal with it.

24
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.500
Wang Jie

25
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.633
Go get the information on the car from last night, Vice President

26
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:29.866
Never mind.

27
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.666
Did you change that car?

28
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.833
Oh, OK, OK.

29
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.900
hung up several times

30
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.866
The handsome past is so humiliating

31
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.600
I stopped by work yesterday and came back.

32
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.466
No more than three sentences along the way

33
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.033
Legal review

34
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.233
The car changed to the lower part, I'll have someone pick it up

35
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.500
this

36
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.633
It's so fierce in the end

37
00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.166
Hello, Miss Sun.

38
00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:25.200
Don't want to pay attention to me and run so far

39
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.600
Why are you here?

40
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.300
It's okay to walk by the way to get some air
