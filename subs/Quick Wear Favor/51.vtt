00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.933
Good teachers also want to see your real scene

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.000
Change level

3
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.500
Okay, so soon.

4
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.466
Where is this adaptation?

5
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.500
Is it a complete re-composition?

6
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.966
Good. You've made great progress recently.

7
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.000
The teacher is happy for you.

8
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.933
You discuss

9
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.400
The teacher left first

10
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.866
Finally got there

11
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.600
I don't know which wicked ghost owes so much

12
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.633
I don't know.

13
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.366
Yao Shanshan, what do you think?

14
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.266
I don't know.

15
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.366
Which inferiority complex may be the mouth?

16
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.833
Someone with a twisted heart

17
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.700
Hey ok

18
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.233
Anyway, we are warm and talented

19
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.433
By the way, are you almost 25kg 40?

20
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.400
How about having confidence?

21
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.766
Of course, the momentum cannot be lost

22
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.966
Haha, the makeup artist painted him as a hair salon girl.

23
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.466
I'm dying of laughter

24
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:58.200
Haha, are you going to sing QQ Love on stage?

25
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.533
miss

26
00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:01.466
Come and see how deeply Su Yunxi was hurt by you

27
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:03.233
To grow so individual

28
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.900
Stop making trouble

29
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.400
Peach eyeshadow with thick, dark eyeliner

30
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.400
And the red lips of Death Barbie powder

31
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.600
I'm not drunk

32
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.733
I've been working at the Lemon Table for so long

33
00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:19.633
The first time I saw someone, I started to play big before I was popular

34
00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:21.200
Everyone has a unified stage outfit.

35
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.566
Why are you so special?

36
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.233
Is this unified?

37
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.400
I didn't know Teacher Zhou drew me like this.

38
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.700
How much did you charge?
