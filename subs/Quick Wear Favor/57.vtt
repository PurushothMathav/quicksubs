00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.166
Uh, that little girl

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.900
You play Zhu Yue

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.100
I promise you'll make an impact.

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.900
Ah sorry director

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.200
That's not my goal.

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.066
I'm still more focused on the musical side

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.033
It's not that I said you are a little girl movie

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.633
What music do you know?

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.166
Director Hou

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.433
Why don't we listen to the theme song first?

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.766
This song.

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.800
It was this little girl who participated in the production of the film

13
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:40.733
Old horse

14
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.500
Why do you think it's so hard for me?

15
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.700
Um, sorry, I want to ask

16
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.400
Are there many scenes in the hospital?

17
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.400
Not much, but important enough.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.100
Well, if you can accept that I don't stop

19
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.066
maybe

20
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.066
I can think about it. OK.

21
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.400
I'll send it up right away to arrange your role

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.766
You don't have to stop.

23
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.600
Is this still you, old man?

24
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.233
Go away

25
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.133
Hey, okay, I'll ask him to play a game with you

26
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.433
You take me on the card for a week

27
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.433
No problem yes

28
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.600
I can finally meet Muse

29
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.300
Sister Nan, Sister Nan, come quickly

30
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.433
Why are you sick?

31
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.766
Sister Nan

32
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.566
My stomach hurts a little, please help me stay overnight

33
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.766
I can't hang up now, please

34
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.166
Hey, how does this work?

35
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.300
Sister Shengnuan, it doesn't matter.

36
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.600
You follow me and I will protect you.

37
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.300
This is the first time I know that blind monks can use this

38
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.900
Hiding behind and waiting for more teammates?

39
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.533
Yeah, are you yelling at me?

40
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.200
No no no no

41
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.666
Boss, can you please stop talking nonsense?

42
00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.900
I'm teaching my Muse to play games

43
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.433
God K is a famous viper

44
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.900
He's not going to mock Christmas night himself

45
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm not arguing right

46
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.100
Just mocking me

47
00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:19.466
I don't play anymore

48
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.466
I'm not ahead of you.

49
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.966
I'm telling you what to leave alone

50
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:25.933
Just hide behind me and how can you surpass the enemy?

51
00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.766
It's not the super teammate I clearly heard you say just now.

52
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:32.200
I mean if I die, please move on

53
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.200
I was hallucinating.

54
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.033
God K actually took Sheng Nuan to play games like a nanny

55
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.466
Really play?

56
00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:45.500
What are you doing?

57
00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.366
I am teaching Sister Nuan to play games
