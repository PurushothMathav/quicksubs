00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.833
Are you Mr. Sheng?

2
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:12.366
Host

3
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.600
He's here to trick you into meeting those second-generation ancestors

4
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.300
I am Fu Yunqin.

5
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.200
What do you mean?

6
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.266
Shouldn't he greet me with a smile?

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.066
I just haven't had breakfast yet

8
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.633
What else is there to eat?

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.366
Sorry, no.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.600
Then you go and do it for me

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.966
It's so beautiful what you think

12
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.200
My brother has been very busy recently.

13
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.166
Let me take you out to play

14
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.600
Go see the world, okay?

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.933
Just wait, those people will educate you well

16
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.900
This carried away canary

17
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.066
Ajie

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.033
here

19
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.300
Oh, this is Shengnuan, right?

20
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.066
My name is Zhao Meijia

21
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.500
Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.633
Su Nian does not appear in person

23
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.766
Instead, they sent a few shrimp soldiers and crab generals to hum

24
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.666
Pretty good

25
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:22.733
warm

26
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.900
I just watched your show two days ago

27
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.366
You real person

28
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.466
Why is there a big gap with what's on TV?

29
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.066
Oh, I'm a straight talker.

30
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.200
I say that because I treat you as a friend

31
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.166
Don't you mind?

32
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.400
No, I also like to talk straight

33
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.166
Oops, you cut your eyelids

34
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.266
It doesn't seem to be a match, it's a bit big and small

35
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.666
Hey, your name is Yajun, right?

36
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.966
Actually I just said so

37
00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.000
Your necklace doesn't match this dress.

38
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.600
Appears to have a very short neck

39
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.866
I'm outspoken, don't you mind?

40
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.700
No, that's fine.

41
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:13.100
How about we play shooting?

42
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:14.633
OK.

43
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.266
Add that limited edition bag to the bet.

44
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.300
How did it go?

45
00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:20.900
That's really good, Nuannuan

46
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.700
Can you shoot?

47
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.366
Do you want us to teach you?

48
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.833
Barely a little

49
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.833
Then you also participate

50
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.766
But that bag costs more than 1 million yuan.

51
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.366
Not allowed

52
00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:37.800
Are you allowed to play like this?

53
00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:40.300
It has nothing to do with him

54
00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:43.200
It's just that we're playing our own game.

55
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.466
Bet so much

56
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.300
What are you afraid of?

57
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.500
No, we always play like this

58
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.266
Let's go together. Okay?
