00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.500
I went to Mr. Ba and personally sent a Weibo response.

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.966
Miss Sheng and I are very important people

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.100
So is it a confession to His Majesty?

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.433
Why?

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.800
Ah!

6
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.400
Something Fu Yunxi

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.966
You actually did it for that woman

8
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.666
Don't save any face for your mother

9
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.366
Mom

10
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:31.933
It's not just your face.

11
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.600
It's face that you smear him like that

12
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.066
Have you thought about his face?

13
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.266
So you help him deal with your mother

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.800
Mom

15
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.266
You insulted him first

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.633
Right?

17
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.566
Am I wrong?

18
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.866
He is a mercenary woman

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.233
He is my favorite.

20
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.400
Can you?

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.466
Don't always have everything

22
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.400
Things are found in others

23
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.566
Sometimes you should also reflect on yourself

24
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.800
Not everyone is obligated to tolerate you

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.500
You are still holding grudges about what happened back then

26
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.766
You help others deal with me

27
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.300
In fact, it's because you still hate me

28
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.266
Right?

29
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.166
Can you?

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:16.466
No.

31
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.333
Everything is always connected to the events of the year

32
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.166
Together?

33
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:19.966
Mom

34
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.200
Can you let me go?

35
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.666
Let go of yourself

36
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.133
Did I refuse to let it go?

37
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.733
You dare to say

38
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:29.166
You just

39
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.766
Have you never forgotten what happened back then?

40
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.000
How do you know I'm tired?

41
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.266
How do you know I don't want to forget?

42
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.200
And you know what?

43
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.466
I've had countless nightmares

44
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:47.233
Every time I dream, a voice is telling me

45
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.033
Even your own mother

46
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.033
I don't love you

47
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:55.766
You know

48
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.266
One caused him to be scolded online

49
00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.666
How did you get this photo?

50
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.166
That's why he came from home on purpose

51
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.833
Come and celebrate my birthday with me

52
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.833
That was 15 years.

53
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.833
The first truly happy birthday

54
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.966
Don't force a smile

55
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500
Don't be afraid of arguments that may happen at any time

56
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.300
I don't have to answer you again and again.

57
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.266
Do I still remember hating you?

58
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.200
I am your mother

59
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:26.833
You can go back.

60
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.266
I will move out of the old house

61
00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:33.300
Don't come to me if you have nothing to do in the future.

62
00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:34.966
I'll see you when I have time.
