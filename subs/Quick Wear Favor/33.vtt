00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.466
Shouldn't it be busy recently?

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.766
Haven't you always wanted to know about Leslie?

3
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.333
How long have I been trying to keep him away?

4
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.033
But he still fell into a coma

5
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.833
Oh, it's a tough situation over there now.

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.900
Do you want to save him?

7
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.633
What do you mean?

8
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.466
Break up with your little boyfriend

9
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.833
Stay With Me

10
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.266
I help your father

11
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.266
Ah, what does that mean?

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.666
Didn't I get a female script?

13
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.200
This kind of bloody gun has a lot of tricks

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.100
Why did it appear to me?

15
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.233
OK

16
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.066
But if Leslie is finished this time

17
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.400
Can my mission still be accomplished?

18
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.500
Until I was young

19
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.233
Are you some kind of pervert?

20
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.666
I won't touch you until I'm 20

21
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.433
That's after the age of 20

22
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.033
Shameless

23
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.866
Think about it without me

24
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.766
He will be dead within a month

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.400
OK, deal.

26
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.400
I can only temporarily apologize to you, boss night.

27
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.000
brother

28
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.100
Is something wrong?

29
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.033
Let's break up.

30
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700
Why is that?

31
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.900
Did I do something wrong?

32
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.900
If so, at least tell me. No

33
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.500
It's not your problem.

34
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.166
I just feel like

35
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.766
We are not suitable

36
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.600
It doesn't fit.

37
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.766
Didn't we have to be fine before?

38
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.200
Drenched
