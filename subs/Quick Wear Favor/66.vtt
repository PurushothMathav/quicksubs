00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.800
Are you angry?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.800
Hang up if you want

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.566
If you want me to take care of you, take care of you

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.600
What about my dignity as a top gifter?

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.433
Ouch, your behavior of hanging up the phone yesterday was not very good.

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.100
Then I didn't mean to, I was wrong.

7
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.900
There's nothing to be angry about.

8
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.666
It's all about catching the wind

9
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.766
Think if you argue with other women about me

10
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.366
But I don't care at all

11
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.666
Are you happy?

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.766
That seems to be the case.

13
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.600
Nature means care

14
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.300
Apologize now

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.766
Prove that my status in his heart is still high

16
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.266
You tomorrow

17
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.300
Are you going to record a 30-to-20 game?

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.400
How do you know?

19
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.833
I'll take you there tomorrow. Okay.

20
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.966
This song hits the soul, I love it so much

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.733
It is said that he composed the music himself

22
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.833
What a beautiful and talented treasure girl

23
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.866
Sister Yang is stabilizing

24
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.400
They're going to trick you into going to the jewelry store

25
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.033
So that you can be stopped by security at the door and make a fool of yourself

26
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.500
It's really not there

27
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.633
You help me tell them I'm going

28
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:46.900
Brother Zhao Meijia

29
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.066
They took Sister Nuan to the jewelry fair

30
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.866
But Sister Nuan didn't have an invitation by then

31
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:56.433
It's time for these second masters to beat

32
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.000
Mao Jie

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.800
Vice President

34
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:01.766
Go see the bluetooth building

35
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.900
Is it the SK president meeting tonight?

36
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:05.133
Yes, Vice President

37
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.600
The organizers sent an invitation

38
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.100
But you refused
