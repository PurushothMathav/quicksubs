00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.700
Hey, I think my husband is serious.

2
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.433
You didn't see the way he stared at Sheng Nuan

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.066
Hey

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.633
You said that he already knew why today was the beginning

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.700
I used to chase him all day for Christmas

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.300
He doesn't even look at her.

7
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.100
Hey, what is this called?

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.266
It's called a wife-chasing crematorium

9
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.566
Have you had enough breakfast?

10
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.666
Didn't eat breakfast

11
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.433
Then stop.

12
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.066
Leave some energy for the brain

13
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.700
Have lunch together

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.766
I made an appointment with the little sister to eat casserole

15
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.866
Tonight.

16
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.200
I go part-time after school in the afternoon

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.966
Send me the address and I'll find you.

18
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.166
The hawthorn plums in that store are really delicious.

19
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.000
You come and I'll make it for you to taste

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.900
Boss is so sweet

21
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.233
Customer Service Customer Service

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.000
How much is Yan Nanheng blackened now?

23
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.866
The target of the host task, Yan Nanheng, is the blackening value of 10.

24
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.900
That's fine.

25
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.566
Now I hope Brother Leslie will give me some strength

26
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.633
Don't say it again

27
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:32.633
Look at that tall guy, No. 34, he's so handsome.

28
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.266
What vision?

29
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:35.800
Is he handsome?

30
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.400
That's not cool.

31
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.600
It's a long way off

32
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.066
What, am I wrong?

33
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.300
Who looked down on them in the first place?

34
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.500
Say people shut up like homeless people

35
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.666
It's nothing, I'm leaving first, what are you doing?

36
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.433
Pick up the boss after get off work money money
