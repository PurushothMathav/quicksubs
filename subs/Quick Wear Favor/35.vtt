00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.266
Hello, Mom.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.733
You finally contacted me.

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.266
The good news is that your father is okay.

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.733
We're all safe now.

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.000
Really? That's great.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.766
But the arrangement of the vocal music has obviously not started yet.

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.166
Of course, did you also hear about your father?

8
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.566
Coma news

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.366
That was actually to confuse Stephen and the others

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.500
Fake news released to the outside world

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.400
Your father completely defeated Stephen this time

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.500
We've sent someone to pick you up.

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.866
Ok mom I'm waiting for you

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.200
Let's let our deal end

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.466
You know I don't have a career

16
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.033
Stop trying to help your father

17
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.600
I don't need your help now.

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.833
You can turn your face and not recognize people if you don't need it, right?

19
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.200
Not busy, right?

20
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.200
There's something wrong with you

21
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.166
Maybe a little

22
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.966
What I want

23
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.166
Must get

24
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.233
You better mind your stinky problems

25
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.600
Laugh heartless

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.166
I can finally find my beloved little wolf dog.

27
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.533
customer service

28
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.300
Help me ask what Yan Nanheng is doing now?

29
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.266
Yan Nanheng has already recognized Master Qing

30
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.300
Back to in-laws

31
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.166
Going back so soon

32
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.500
He probably doesn't want to see me now

33
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.600
After all, in his heart

34
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm a person who plays with his feelings

35
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.000
According to system monitoring

36
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.233
He returned to his in-laws and was poisoned the next day

37
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.200
Just got out of the hospital today.

38
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.633
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

39
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.966
The in-laws are now holding a banquet at the villa

40
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.833
You should be able to see him now.

41
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.300
Remember to wear a dress

42
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.366
Thank you for your kindness.
