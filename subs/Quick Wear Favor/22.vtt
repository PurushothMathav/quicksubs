1
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.333
warm

2
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.800
Is your mom out?

3
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.300
He's not on business anymore.

4
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.633
This kid

5
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:23.166
You keep your aunt out and let her in

6
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.066
I'll trick this little bastard into opening the door first

7
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.633
Take away their gestures

8
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.033
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

9
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.600
Hey you little bastard

10
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.566
Well, let's put the jewelry first

11
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.466
It's better to have a safe place

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.800
Here we go.

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600
Find a more upscale hotel to stay in

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.400
So late

15
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.200
I sent you a message, did you see it?

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.766
About prom partners

17
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.033
I want to invite you.

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.966
Did not go in and did not participate

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.100
Host please note

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.666
Detected that the blackening value of the mission target Ye Nanheng has increased

21
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.633
Instant blackening value 50

22
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.866
Hey navigation

23
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll teach you why you don't speak

24
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.400
Can I come and stay at your house for a while?

25
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.700
Are we familiar?

26
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.800
Ah! What's wrong with you?

27
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.000
Like a stray dog every day

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It is also comparable to Lonely Blue Peak

29
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.166
Why don't you speak?

30
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.466
Let you down

31
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.633
Never have a chance to tease me again

32
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.300
Why am I so sad?
