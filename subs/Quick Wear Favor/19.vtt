00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.333
Hey!

2
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.666
OK

3
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.266
Yeah.

4
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.433
OK

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.300
How is Auntie doing recently?

6
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.433
Recovering well

7
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.466
Thanks.

8
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:30.200
I heard you passed up your chance to compete in the national math competition

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.766
No time.

10
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.266
It's okay, are you worried that you can't help it?

11
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.633
Take good care of Auntie

12
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.766
Can I help you?

13
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.466
Although I don't take care of people either

14
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.700
But I can hire a nurse

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.666
So he can take good care of Auntie

16
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.333
Because when you win the prize in the future

17
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.100
You can have a good future

18
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.500
This way you don't have to listen to me anymore

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.266
He really hurts you

20
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.766
Then

21
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.400
Please help me take good care of your mother, no problem

22
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.633
Thanks.

23
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.666
Oops, just remember that if you become prosperous in the future

24
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.866
Just cover me

25
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600
It's okay to be kicked back by the crew

26
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
I actually fell out of the top ten on the school flower list

27
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.800
Shengnuan you bitch

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.800
You did it on purpose. Now are you satisfied?

29
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.100
Nuannuan, please ignore him.

30
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.033
Otherwise, what if he lies here again?

31
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.766
So it's money school flower?

32
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:28.766
It's real

33
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.300
The most we can do is to pretend to be rich

34
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.933
You can pretend to be you

35
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:37.466
Aren't you going to buy milk tea? Let's go

36
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.566
Peng, we're here to pick you up.

37
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:52.700
It's the first time I've come to school to see me in so many years

38
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.100
Congratulations to the host

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.766
The blackening value of the task object Yannanhuang has been reduced again

40
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.033
The real value is 40%.

41
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:00.766
Golden girl
