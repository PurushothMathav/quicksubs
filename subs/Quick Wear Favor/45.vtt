1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.700
what

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.666
I actually took advantage of the drunkenness to give Yannanhang to Huohuo

3
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.100
Ah!

4
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.166
Sorry.

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.266
I drank too much last night I know

6
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.466
You don't have to feel the psychological burden.

7
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.300
I'm fine.

8
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:34.366
Well, even though I'm a traditional person

9
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.166
But I don't want to force you

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.100
It's okay, I'll be responsible for you.

11
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.766
Then we now

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.266
What's the relationship?

13
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.833
object

14
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.400
But

15
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.000
In my family tradition

16
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.500
Love without the purpose of marriage

17
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.900
All hooligans

18
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.333
NANA

19
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.433
or

20
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.600
Let's get a license to get married

21
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:09.966
As long as you are married

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.666
Everything I have is yours

23
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.900
Get the certificate?

24
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.566
Didn't you say you were responsible for me?

25
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.633
It won't be a fight.

26
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.300
It doesn't matter.

27
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.233
If you don't want to

28
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.633
I listen to you

29
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.800
Get the certificate, as long as you want

30
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.600
We will receive

31
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.366
Really?

32
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.300
Wife, you are so kind

33
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.466
Then let's go first

34
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.900
Wait, how did you become a wife?

35
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:55.966
warm

36
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:58.666
Wait for me.

37
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.566
I'll take you away first

38
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.566
Find you again

39
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:08.600
Congratulations to the host for successfully completing the task

40
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.166
Task rating

41
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.400
What task did you do?

42
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.033
Why am I crying?

43
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.800
Due to the protective mechanism

44
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.400
We'll still clear your first task.

45
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.800
90% of the world's memory

46
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.000
Who is that guy?

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.633
Host, we are about to start the second mission.

48
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.000
Wow, I'm not a superstar, am I?

49
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:43.333
No no no the original host this time

50
00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:44.966
Was abandoned by the villain

51
00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:47.966
A stuntman who suffered humiliation and died young

52
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.100
This is so useless
