00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.200
What do you want me to do here?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.366
Mrs. Chen

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.566
Did you know that your son announced to the public

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.933
He has a fiancÃ©e

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.300
Even if it is announced

6
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.466
That's Li Na too

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.466
Mrs. Chen, don't kid yourself

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.100
Who doesn't know

9
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.433
The fiancÃ©e he announced to the public is the eye

10
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.300
Li Xue's daughter-in-law Li Na

11
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.900
Can't get into his eyes at all

12
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.533
Muzhizhi

13
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.800
Much better than your scorpion woman

14
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.900
I scorpion I scorpion

15
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.666
I took out 10 billion to play with your son

16
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.233
If I were a scorpion

17
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.900
I should have been there when you didn't allow it.

18
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.500
When I was dating your son

19
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.366
Kill instead of now what ah ah ah

20
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.800
Why is it so quiet here?

21
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.333
No one has a master

22
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.033
I have a bad feeling

23
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.200
Let's not go in

24
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.800
But it's all here

25
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.200
Is everything okay?

26
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.166
Why is there no one?

27
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.866
Master, my sixth sense tells me not to go in

28
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.800
Let's go back first. It's alright.

29
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.266
Let's wait

30
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.266
Why are you here?

31
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.233
Program Nan

32
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm here to deliver

33
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.500
Why are you here?

34
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.066
I can't get in touch with my mom

35
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.600
The last time I called him

36
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.666
He said he was here.

37
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.633
Ah, what's that?

38
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.000
Isn't this aunt's necklace?

39
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.200
aunt
