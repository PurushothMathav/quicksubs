00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.500
Get out of the way, did you spread rumors?

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Don't put gold on your face

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.466
I don't have time to spend with a lady like you

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.566
I make money by my ability

5
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.700
Not like you.

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.400
Find any man and you will have money to spend

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.566
I advise you

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.066
Get out of here

9
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:19.900
Or else?

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.666
I have countless ways to get you out of here

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.633
Why?

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.066
Wu Junjun, Mr. Chen calls you to his office

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.366
Mr. Chen, are you looking for me? What's the matter with your home recently?

14
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.100
No, why do you ask that?

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.900
Well, let me ask you where you were last night

16
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.700
I went home last night.

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.566
lie

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.600
Take a good look at yourself. What is this?

19
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.100
I see.

20
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.366
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation.

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.766
No, what does this have to do with you?

22
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.966
Why does Mr. Chen interfere in my private life?

23
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.400
So what they say is true

24
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.400
I'd rather think so

25
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.900
I don't know why.

26
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.566
A picture of me and my brother will be posted like this

27
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.566
Your brother, I was kicked out of my comfort zone

28
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.900
I had nowhere to go.

29
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.100
So my brother took me to open a hotel

30
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.900
I don't know why.

31
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.233
This is how it's going to go.

32
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.266
Okay, here's the rest.

33
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.233
Leave it to me.
