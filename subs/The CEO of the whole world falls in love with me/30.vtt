00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.933
I drank too much last night

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.200
Don't argue with a drunk man

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.766
Drunk truth

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.866
My ancestors can't afford me

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.233
So how should I punish you?

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:13.900
Mr. Chen

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.166
You don't care about a little yellow-haired girl

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.000
Right? Sorry.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.866
I'm so stingy.

10
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.833
It tastes good.

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.000
But I really didn't expect it.

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.766
I'm so worthless in your heart

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.133
You really don't understand, don't you understand?

14
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.866
Know what don't you know

15
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.700
Why are you in my company?

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.366
Why is it in my house?

17
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.333
Every time you are in danger

18
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.966
Why am I by your side?

19
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.300
You honestly have no idea?

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.266
Well, wasn't it because of a chance encounter?

21
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.266
You are really stupid

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.133
Oh master, are you stupid?

23
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.666
He's following you.

24
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.100
Think about it. They can look at other people's stocks.

25
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
And Chen Xunnan, he is a businessperson

26
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.166
Merchant Gravity, he is afraid that you will run away

27
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.100
Is that really the case?

28
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.800
Did he really see it?

29
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.266
I have a lucky cat in my body

30
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.600
Want to imprison me

31
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.900
You got someone to follow me?

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.000
Mr. Chen, what you are doing is wrong.

33
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.700
I have signed a 5-year contract with you

34
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.166
Are you still afraid that I will run away?

35
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.766
I thought you were really nice to me

36
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.366
I didn't expect it to be for the money

37
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.200
For money? What for money?

38
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.333
You get someone to follow me and leave me

39
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.600
Isn't it for the money?

40
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.400
I will keep you for the money

41
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.466
See for yourself

42
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.533
Where do you look like you're rich?

43
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.233
Uh, I, uh

44
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.466
Hey, I wanted to forget you

45
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600
Who knew you had to hit the gun

46
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.266
Then I'll show you what kind of person I am
