3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.600
Get out of here obediently

4
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.033

Sorry Mr. Chen

7
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.300
If it weren't for me

8
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.466
It's all my fault

9
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.533
I said it's none of your business

10
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.900
What are you sorry for?

11
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.666

Shut up, dog

13
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.033
Mr. Chen, don't misunderstand

14
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.800
I'm not talking about you and me

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.100
I don't know what to say.

16
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.766
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.800
It's nothing. I just say the wrong thing when I'm in a hurry.

18
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.500
In a hurry

19
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.133
Are you anxious for me? Are you hurt?

20
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.233
I'm worried

21
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.266
Just be anxious, you are anxious for me.

22
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.900
Do you like me?

23
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.700
I don't have it. Then you don't like me.

24
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.366
No.

25
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.166
No, so do you like it or not?

26
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.466
Mr. Chen, I didn't mean that

27
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.266
