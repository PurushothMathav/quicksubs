00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.233
What's your trouble?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.600
No.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.366
Nothing mom

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.566
You go back first

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.000
Only my niece takes care of me

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.400
I'll be going back then.

7
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.666
Take good care of yourself, don't worry.

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.866
In fact, I've been following you all the time just now.

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.200
What did you see?

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.766
Chen Xuenan, in fact, your mother loves you very much

11
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.300
You mustn't cheat on him because of him

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.866
You are the only one who cheated, don't blame your mother.

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.366
Please communicate with Auntie Chen.

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.533
He may have some last resort

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.466
That man is my biological father. Um?

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.466
Is it funny? He abandoned his wife and children

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.300
I didn't expect to be dead yet

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.300
I didn't expect it.

19
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.966
He used to have such a terrible past

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.966
Don't be sad.

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.900
Immortal, he loves you very much, right?

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.233
Wan Group was founded by my grandfather

23
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.633
Facing bankruptcy that year

24
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.300
He was afraid of taking responsibility and left me and my mother behind

25
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.166
It made me what I am today

26
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.666
I thought my family environment was poor

27
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.300
I didn't expect his family environment to be worse

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.766
Supreme brother

29
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.500
Why was I released so quickly?

30
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.066
Did he force you to do something?

31
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.133
Brother, he didn't leave.

32
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.166
Come home with me. He can't come with you

33
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.366
Chen Xunan, don't go too far

34
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.000
Brother, what are you doing?

35
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.566
He didn't push me.

36
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.866
Are you all right?

37
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.466
Go away
