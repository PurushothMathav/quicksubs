00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.766
Professor, you are so chic

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.833
Much better than Chen Xunana

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.366
Chen Xunan again

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.233
Why did you blurt it out?

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.466
Yes professor

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.966
What job do you want me to do?

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.300
I'll do anything.

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.600
Come and sit first

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.066
How about before work?

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.400
I'll do one thing first

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.433
What's the matter?

12
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.466
Let me see if it hurts today.

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.233
No need to cut your hands

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.866
It's alright, this will swell if you don't rub it open.

15
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.633
You say you're always reckless

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.400
The professor is so gentle

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.600
Not as bad-tempered as Chen Xunan

18
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.466
Why is it Chen Xu Nan again?

19
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.166
Why is he so haunted?

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.033
Yeah. Does it still hurt?

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.400
That's better. You?

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.600
Walk carefully in the future

23
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.666
At least you won't hurt yourself

24
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.600
Hmm, got it.

25
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.266
Zhizhi

26
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.400
For my financial and economic modeling these days

27
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.600
Are you exhausted?

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.600
I'm not tired professor, you will definitely win an award

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.000
You are the youngest professor in the world of finance

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.400
If it weren't for your financial literacy

31
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.633
Have a special feeling

32
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.966
My financial and economic model

33
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.433
It won't be built so soon.

34
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.600
Let's talk about it.

35
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.433
You seem to have a very good sixth sense for financial data

36
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.966
No, the professor taught you well.

37
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.700
That's my sixth sense, okay?

38
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.000
Stupid handsome guy

39
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.033
Professor, let me take another look

40
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.566
Don't be stressed. Hmm.

41
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.000
The judges are invited to enter now

42
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.266
Ring Master ready

43
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.533
only

44
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.433
Looking for so long

45
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.900
Finally found you
