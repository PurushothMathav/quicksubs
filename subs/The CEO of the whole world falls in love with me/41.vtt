00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to veto Professor Song Yangchuan's nomination now

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Mr. Chen, why did you reject my nomination?

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.166
No reason.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.800
Because I don't like it.

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.800
Chen Junnan Residence

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.233
Forget it, how can you forget it?

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.400
The professor doesn't sleep that long either.

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.866
Now it's all gone to waste

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.466
He doesn't even have a reason

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:21.966
Residence

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.866
Wait a minute.

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.033
Send him over.

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.966
Why would you do that?

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.800
Do you know

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.066
How much did the supermarket pay for this sword demon?

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.300
How can you say a few words?

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.100
Just deny the efforts of others?

18
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.466
Do you feel bad? What?

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.900
Do you know

20
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.800
You left without saying a word.

21
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.766
I've been looking for you for so long, I didn't listen to you question me

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.033
Chen Xunan, let him go

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.500
Chen Xunan

24
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.900
You haven't changed a bit

25
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.200
Still so post-secondary

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.700
What right do you have to say that after college?

27
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.333
I've been looking for you for so long.

28
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.200
You are playing with others here

29
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.800
Don't think I don't know why you're looking for me.

30
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.233
Isn't it because of my lucky physique?

31
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.300
Chen Jun, you are the most selfish person I have ever met

32
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.800
It turns out that I am such a person in your heart

33
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.966
Yes, I'm looking for you because of your lucky physique.

34
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.300
Do you think if you don't have your lucky physique

35
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.866
Will I take another look at you?

36
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.366
People like me

37
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.833
Just say a few words to reject others

38
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.700
Isn't it normal?

39
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.666
Ji Zhi, are you alright?

40
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.033
I'm fine, sorry.

41
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.133
It's all because of me

42
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.266
So you teach

43
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.733
This has nothing to do with you

44
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.033
Let's go back then.

45
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:50.466
OK
