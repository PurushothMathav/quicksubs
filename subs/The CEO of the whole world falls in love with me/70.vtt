00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.900
I don't want to talk to you

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.166
It doesn't matter anymore

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.166
Mo Zhizhi

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.266
Did you ever like me?

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.633
Why now?

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.066
You still do this

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.166
Because I don't know in your heart

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.600
You cut

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.000
Cut lamb lip

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.800
And Me

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Who is more important?

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.466
It was like wishful thinking from the beginning

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.433
Forcing you to be with me

14
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.666
Forcing you to marry me

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.833
I have lost a lot since I was a child

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.566
So I want to put

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.833
The person you like is held tightly in your hand

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.466
I liked you from the beginning

19
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.400
But you and your brother were childhood sweethearts

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.566
Two little guesses

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.800
Professor is your type again

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.866
It's like I've always been stalking you

23
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.466
You never said thank you

24
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.066
I liked it.

25
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.633
What about now?

26
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.266
If you like it, you can't become it.

27
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.800
Besides, I just liked it

28
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.900
What are you still doing with me?

29
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.900
We have nothing left to talk about

30
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.833
Don't come to me again

31
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.600
Don't you want to know about your sister?

32
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.400
I don't bother you about my sister

33
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.100
My brother will take care of her

34
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.500
Do you really know that as a brother?

35
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.900
Don't you see?

36
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.500
Your sister is weird sometimes

37
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.700
It seems you still don't know

38
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.833
I'll ask about my sister myself

39
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.433
You didn't realize that your sister wasn't yours at all

40
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.433
What do you mean?

41
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.066
There's an evil spirit in your sister's body

42
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:44.800
That's a cat!

43
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:49.433
Miss Su, have you read too many fantasy novels?

44
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.266
Do you believe it or not?

45
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
Didn't you notice that one of your sister's cats was lost?

46
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.666
Didn't you notice that your sister watches stocks?

47
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.100
Look at the economic trend chart

48
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.166
Has reached a place of prophecy

49
00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:01.800
It's actually the cat

50
00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.300
That's a lucky cat.

51
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:05.633
Whenever your sister sneezes

52
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:07.633
He will enter your sister's body

53
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.466
Maybe one day in the future

54
00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:12.966
This cat has completely taken over your sister's body

55
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.900
Then the epitaph will really be dead
