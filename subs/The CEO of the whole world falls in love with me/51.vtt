00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.266
Go ahead.

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.966
You are the wooden donkey.

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.233
You are, let's talk

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.500
It seems that you like your sister very much

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.800
What do you want?

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.133
Don't want to do anything

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.033
I just want to help you win your sister's heart

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.800
So what if it's his brother?

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.533
You are not related by blood

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.000
Why can't we be together?

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.300
Do you think he is happy with Chen Xunan?

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.466
Every day is either hurt or shed tears

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.800
He's not happy at all.

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.166
Why is it not you who can make him happy?

15
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.000
Yes!

16
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.566
Why can't I be the one who can make him happy?

17
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.800
Near the water, the platform gets the moon first

18
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.533
You don't give up.

19
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.333
Such a good wine

20
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.133
Why are you telling me this?

21
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.600
Because I like Mr. Chen

22
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.700
I've been obsessed with you since the first time I met him

23
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.466
I have loved Lee since I was a child

24
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.100
I can see it in your eyes

25
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.500
Why can outsiders see that I like him?

26
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.300
He himself never knew

27
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.400
You don't need to worry about our business

28
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.600
Zhizhi, let's have some snacks

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.533
What are you doing so busy as a customer service?

30
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.433
What customer service?

31
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.900
Brother, I put your words online

32
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.100
Many people are willing to pay a high price for you

33
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.866
Everyone loves your work

34
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.966
Brother, are you angry?

35
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.866
I just want more people to see your work

36
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.166
How come?

37
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.566
Do what you want

38
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.100
Brother, I will never be angry with you.

39
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.200
But speaking of

40
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.766
You see, I was so ugly when I was a kid

41
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:23.700
How come?

42
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.300
In my heart, you have always been the most beautiful
