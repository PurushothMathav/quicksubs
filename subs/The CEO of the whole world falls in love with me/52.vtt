00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.433
Is that woman really so poor that she can only sell flowers?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.566
Why are you still thinking about a stupid woman?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.466
Does being poor have anything to do with me?

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.166
Zhizhi, you are not sleepy so late

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.266
Brother, I'm not sleepy.

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.900
If there is someone else willing to pay a high price for you

7
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.000
You go to sleep first

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.966
You haven't rested well to take care of me these days, okay?

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.633
Then you go to bed early. Hmm.

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.600
This is when Konoshi was a child

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.900
So stupid

12
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.900
You can't even see my trumpet.

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.633
So stupid

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.166
It's all about me

15
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.900
There are also many landscape painters with good culture

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.300
Don't you look at something else?

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.266
Yo, the tone is so domineering

18
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.900
It looks like Chen Xunan.

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.800
Maybe being overbearing is a common problem with people who don't have money

20
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.233
Well, you sold three paintings in the past.

21
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.066
I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed.

22
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.566
Mr. Shen still cares about Miss Mu, right?

23
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.033
If you're so elusive again

24
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.700
I'll make you disappear without a trace, okay?

25
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.533
Don't believe it

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.133
I just wanted to tell you about tomorrow's schedule

27
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.300
And there is only one important document

28
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.700
These are wooden boys, aren't they cute?

29
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.666
If you mention this woman to me again

30
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.300
Get the hell out of here

31
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.766
Obviously you can't let go of what you said

32
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.633
I said I swear

33
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.566
I will

34
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.566
I will never mention anything about Miss Mu again

35
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.366
include

36
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.133
He has been downstairs in the company for several mornings

37
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.000
Waiting for you

38
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.633
I will never tell you
