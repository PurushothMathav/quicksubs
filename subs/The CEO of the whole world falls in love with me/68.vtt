00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.166
Mrs. Chen's seat, even if it's not my turn to sit

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.100
Won't fall on you

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.166
Do you know how pitiful you are?

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:07.966
What!

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.500
Mrs. Chen, is it your fault?

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.333
You see that Chen Xunan is about to marry another woman

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.566
You can't help it.

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.200
So I had to hurt Mrs. Chen

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.933
Then blame others

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.633
Poor Mrs. Chen is so kind to you

11
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.400
If Chen Xunan knew the truth

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.200
Do you think he will ever forgive you?

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.333
You are talking nonsense, Auntie Chen is your fault.

14
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.833
Do you know what is the most pitiful thing about human beings?

15
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.500
Is stupid like you

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.400
Did so many bad things

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.133
In the end, it was just for Chen Xu

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.900
Come to this broken bar and meet

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.966
I didn't do it.

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.266
It's all you, it's all you

21
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.333
wicked

22
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.700
You've done all the ungrateful things

23
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400
In the end, he was just a villain in vain

24
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.800
Women take care of themselves

25
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.866
What's the matter with this bitch today?

26
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.066
He must have meant it

27
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.000
Trying to ruin my date with Sunan

28
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.900
Muzhizhi, stop

29
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.800
I'm warning you, why don't you leave?

30
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.633
I'll make you pay. What?

31
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.900
You are afraid

32
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.066
Why didn't I see you afraid when I did bad things?

33
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.366
Tell you today I'm here for you

34
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.100
Only you are not satisfied

35
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.466
My master will be happy

36
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.066
Ah!

37
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.700
How dare you hit me?

38
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.500
Mo Zhizhi

39
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.266
Oh, dear.

40
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.966
I have to go to the play myself

41
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.366
Are you all right?

42
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.500
It's okay, I'm glad you came in time.

43
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.966
I just know you don't need to explain?

44
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:46.633
What can I explain?

45
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.166
Would you believe me?

46
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.166
Xu Xu?

47
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:53.700
Well, I'll tell you.

48
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.766
He fell on purpose.

49
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:59.900
It has nothing to do with me. He wants to injure me and

50
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.033
Ah don't eat it

51
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.333
I have always been open and honest

52
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.966
Never brush any small tricks

53
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.666
If I were to push someone

54
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.066
Play football upright

55
00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.300
And things I haven't done

56
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:17.900
I will never admit it

57
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
Include anything
