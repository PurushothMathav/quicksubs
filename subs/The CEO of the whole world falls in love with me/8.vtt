1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.300
Mr. Chen's shares rose sharply

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.200
We bought enough to trade

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.866
And he didn't disappoint.

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.700
Once tested, it came out

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.800
I always feel

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.766
He has a special sensitivity to stock numbers

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.900
Mr. Chen, you have spent so much effort

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.300
Just to test him

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.500
Or else?

10
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.866
I didn't want to be the behind-the-scenes trader

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.100
What? Did you read that right?

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.833
Is it a big red palm?

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.933
It's the eldest, but Sister Na, this may be a fluke

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:27.933
Let's not just meet him

15
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.966
But the rainbow has clearly fallen through the sky

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.366
How is that possible?

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.733
It's normal to be quiet

18
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.200
Sister Na, don't worry about it.

19
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.733
The position of planning director

20
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.300
It's for you, Sister Na

21
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.833
No one can compete with me for the position of director of the planning department

22
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.000
Humph

23
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.166
What, I deducted a month's salary as soon as I started work?

24
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.266
Sorry, I didn't expect the boss to do that either.

25
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.500
It's alright, this

26
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.633
Brother is rich

27
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.300
Son, keep the money you earn and spend it yourself.

28
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.366
Oops mom what did you say

29
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.200
We are family after all

30
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.000
Muzi fish, go out

31
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.933
Be obedient

32
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.133
Listen to mom

33
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.900
You go out first, brother

34
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.900
You go out first

35
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.300
Muzi fish is the brother brought in by the stepmother

36
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.866
Although not related to me by blood

37
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.866
But he took good care of me

38
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.466
I think

39
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.566
He is the world

40
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.666
The best brother
