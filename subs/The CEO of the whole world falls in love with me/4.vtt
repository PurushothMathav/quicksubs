00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
Daughter, eat more

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.166
Okay, hurry up!

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.466
Eat, eat

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.333
Our family is about to be eaten poor by you

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.600
Say less

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.733
The child is still in the hospital bed

7
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.866
Am I wrong?

8
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.100
Your daughter is injured like this

9
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.700
If there are any problems in the future

10
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.600
Are we going to support her for the rest of her life?

11
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.166
Don't worry daughter

12
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.000
It will get better soon.

13
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.433
Dad will support you for the rest of your life.

14
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.000
OK

15
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.433
Mr. Chen, are you really going to lie to Miss Muzhizhi?

16
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.366
I looked into him.

17
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.900
There was nothing special about him.

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.400
This is the compensation you gave me.

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.366
Miss Mu, it stands to reason that with your emotional intelligence

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.033
You won't get any compensation.

21
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000
We Chen always see you without a job

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.100
For the sake of lack of money

23
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.366
Gave you the job

24
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.466
But why is my contract so strange?

25
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.833
What can't you leave the Wan Group within 5 years?

26
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.033
Otherwise, even if I date

27
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.500
Given the particularity of your data analytics profession

28
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.166
And there were data clerks before

29
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.766
Take away company data

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.333
Therefore, our company has newly developed

31
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.433
So cruel, when was it reformulated?

32
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.333
You belong to the overlord clause

33
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.666
New this morning

34
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.900
I always feel like you're targeting me

35
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.433
Miss Mu Zhizhi, you can not sign

36
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:20.366
If the personal injury you caused me before

37
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.366
Diehard capitalist Miss Mu Zhezhe

38
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.600
You have no choice.

39
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:26.733
All right.

40
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.500
I see your injury is almost healed

41
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.033
Come to work tomorrow
