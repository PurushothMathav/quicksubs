00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.133
Then I'll treat you.

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.000
No, come on.

3
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.333
OK

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.866
Song cry where are you

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.666
I'm at the Phoenix Bar.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.500
Pink Bar

7
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.800
I don't know why I went to a place like this

8
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.166
girl girl

9
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.633
Girl, are you alright?

10
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.700
What are you doing?

11
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.333
car

12
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.366
car

13
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.366
Wake up the car

14
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.666
Hey go go

15
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.000
Mr. Chen, let him go

16
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.400
Why aren't you unhappy to see him?

17
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.800
So what?

18
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.400
He just doesn't want to talk to you

19
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.733
So I came to the bar

20
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:18.866
He would rather come to the bar

21
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.366
I don't want to come back to you

22
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.300
Is that so?

23
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.133
Mr. Chen, let him go

24
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.600
Let him find the right person

25
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.833
Don't tell me it's you who's right for him

26
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.700
No, me, and certainly not you.

27
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.300
But at least we have a common language

28
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.000
common language

29
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.800
Any kind of shit

30
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.200
Professor Trouble, take him to the police station

31
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800
Thanks.
