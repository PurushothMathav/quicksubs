00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.166
Professor Muzhizhi

2
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.466
Are you also coming to this party?

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.566
Yeah you are special today

4
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.366
Thank you, isn't that Muzhi Zhi?

5
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.866
Why is he with Teacher Gao?

6
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.833
Why didn't you come to class this afternoon?

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.266
It's not because of the boss of my company

8
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.433
He left me with absolutely no time

9
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.766
Is that Mr. Chen?

10
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.966
Well, I'll save you a spot in my next class.

11
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.266
Come on, come on, take a quick video.

12
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.100
Please, please come!

13
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.166
Ok, next time.

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.533
Mr. Chen, this Muzhizhi is an employee of our company

15
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.500
But being so close to our financial advisor

16
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.166
That's probably not very appropriate.

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.000
Mr. Chen, it's so late, you haven't slept yet?

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.633
Didn't you sleep so late?

19
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.566
If you're okay

20
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.866
I'm going to rest first

21
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.633
You have a nice dress on.

22
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.033
It's perfect for a date.

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.833
That doesn't feel good.

24
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.800
What do you mean by that?

25
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.500
He buys you clothes to go to the party

26
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.966
You didn't even say thank you

27
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.500
You have to say thank you for liking it

28
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.933
Thank you, the clothes are beautiful, I like them very much, thank you.

29
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.900
No need to come

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.466
What's up?

31
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.333
OK
