1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.466
Then let's renegotiate the terms of compensation

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.800
But you weren't hurt either?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.666
Do I have to break my head to be hurt?

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.900
That's not what I meant.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.300
Who is the victim of this accident?

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.566
Miss Mu, my heart is not very good

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.366
Maybe you just did that

8
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.166
It's already punched me

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.166
Excuse me.

10
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.466
Take a call

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.566
I don't care about squeaks

12
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.000
What shall we buy next time?

13
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.166
What stocks did he move in?

14
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.433
It's all our family's fortune

15
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.800
Lucky, come out and take a look at the stocks

16
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.966
Hmph, who let you take that stinky man?

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.500
I can't get rich either, please help me.

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.933
I'll buy you Lucy's new album then.

19
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.000
Luxi deal

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.100
Buying Fulla Properties

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.300
I will definitely buy Fulla Properties tomorrow

22
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.066
You also trade stocks

23
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.900
The stock you're talking about has fallen below sky-high prices

24
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.566
The company is going bankrupt, are you sure?

25
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.233
Hahaha maybe

26
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.666
Fra Properties stock falls below the limit

27
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.900
Was facing bankruptcy

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.633
But I don't want to come back overnight

29
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.966
The stock price rose sharply

30
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.633
Go check the girl in the hospital for me
