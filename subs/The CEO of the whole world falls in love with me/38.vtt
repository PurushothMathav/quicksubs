00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.966
It's over. It's over.

2
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.033
I'm late.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.666
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry, don't worry.

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.400
Professor Ke

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.733
I have something important to do, so I'll go first

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:17.233
I'll invite you to dinner another day and apologize.

7
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.466
Are you all right?

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.600
Ah it's alright

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.966
You have already graduated, why are you still rash?

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.066
Professor Ke is still so gentle

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.666
Ah professor

12
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.466
I'm going to be late, so I'll go in first.

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.966
See you next time.

14
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.766
Hello, this is my resume.

15
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.266
Your resume doesn't meet our requirements.

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.866
But I really need this job

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.566
Please take another look.

18
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.100
I said it doesn't meet the requirements

19
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.633
Can't you understand human language?

20
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.066
Who says it doesn't fit?

21
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.633
Ouch professor

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.466
I happen to be missing an assistant

23
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.666
It's him, professor

24
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.400
What's the problem?

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
No problem no problem no problem

26
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.000
Ji Zhi, come with me, okay?

27
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.733
Don't professors want assistants?

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.466
Why do you suddenly need an assistant?

29
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.300
Professor, what are you doing here?

30
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.166
I am the headquarters of this financial club

31
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.500
It turns out that professor, you also took a private job

32
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800
I thought what did you think

33
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.333
Finance is my job

34
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.900
Teaching is just a sideline.

35
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.700
I see
