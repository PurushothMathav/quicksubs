00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.366
Go investigate

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.300
See if there really is such a thing

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.533
And the accident

4
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.366
Is there really a cat missing?

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.166
Yes wait a minute

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.833
What else does Mr. Chen order?

7
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.866
Squeak can't know about this.

8
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.866
And if this is true

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.166
Go check the method.

10
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.566
Is there any way to make only

11
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.066
Fully occupy this artifact

12
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.400
You mean to kill the cat?

13
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.566
This cat cannot die

14
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.166
Otherwise, you will only be sad

15
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.800
I want them all to understand

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.566
Human and cat integrated lucky attribute

17
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.466
Interesting

18
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.066
Ah, Mr. Chen, long time no see

19
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.166
Convenient, do you mind not talking?

20
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.700
Go ahead and leave me alone.

21
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.766
Then you can just walk around

22
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.000
I'll be right back.

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.366
Hmm please

24
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.400
Hello Miss Mu

25
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.066
Hello, you know me?

26
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.100
Miss Mu, leave Chen Xunnan

27
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.066
What? Miss Mu looks smart

28
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.600
Why can't I understand human language?

29
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.866
I said leave Chen Xunnan

30
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.566
Why? You are so stupid!

31
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.400
Don't you know that Chen Xunnan keeps you by his side

32
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.566
Just to take advantage of

33
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.900
How is that possible?

34
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.333
Take a look.

35
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.400
What do you have to let him keep you by your side?

36
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.966
Oh, he just took a fancy to your lucky attributes.

37
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100
How do you know?

38
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.566
Don't you know that since you joined the Wan Group

39
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.266
Group project investment profits rose by 4 rounds

40
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.900
That's a terrible statistic.
