00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.233
I'm not someone who doesn't know right and wrong

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.433
I hope you don't keep targeting him.

3
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.700
Muzhizhi

4
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.600
I won't make you feel better

5
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.300
I'll go first, you can follow up on this data, eh?

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.366
Okay. Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

7
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.800
I have to catch a bus, our school is remote

8
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.266
Only one car goes directly

9
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.666
I can't go back after 7 o'clock. New model.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.400
you

11
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.166
Why are you?

12
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.700
Have you handed in the financial statements?

13
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.400
No, don't you want it tomorrow afternoon?

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.166
Oh, I forgot.

15
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:43.300
But colleagues should love each other

16
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.866
Or you can stay

17
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.600
Wait for our other colleagues.

18
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.366
Well you did it on purpose

19
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.066
Right.

20
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.300
I just did it on purpose, what can you do to me?

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.100
No and it's 18:58 now

22
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.666
What about your car?

23
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.466
We're leaving in two minutes

24
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.833
Guess if you can make it?

25
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.666
Good luck.

26
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.333
What do you do?

27
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.066
If you can't go back to school tonight, there's nowhere to go

28
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.566
Otherwise go home

29
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.966
No, my aunt will definitely eat me when I go back

30
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.933
But if you go to a hotel

31
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.166
I have no living expenses this month

32
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.600
Mr. Chen, get in the car!

33
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.833
I don't want to say the same thing again. Hmm.
