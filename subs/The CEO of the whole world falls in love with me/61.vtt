1
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.900
Although Auntie Mu Zhizhi opposed the marriage

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.900
But you can't kill people, can you?

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.100
No, I didn't.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.733
Sunan, trust me.

5
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.700
Because my aunt was against the marriage

6
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.600
It's really not me.

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.500
I didn't. No. Why did you go there?

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.266
When I called my aunt today

9
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.700
Auntie told me you asked him there alone today

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.866
There is a person on the Internet who asked me to buy a painting at a high price

11
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.166
He asked me to send the words there, and you dare to quibble

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.433
Asahi, look

13
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.066
This is Auntie's nail polish

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.466
It must have been when he was pushing his throat with his aunt

15
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.400
Rub it on

16
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.266
Didn't you say that someone asked you to buy something?

17
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.866
Who is that guy?
