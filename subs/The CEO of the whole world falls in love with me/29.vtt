00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:04.400
I went to that bar and

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.900
Could it be that I was given by that bar?

3
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.033
Miss Mu, what's wrong with you, Mr. Chen?

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.800
How did I get back last night?

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.900
Mr. Chen brought you back last night.

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.000
You are drunk

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.366
Mr. Chen asked me to take a bath for the clothes you changed.

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.566
So are my clothes torn or something?

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.600
No, I just threw up a lot last night

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.500
Okay, you can go down first.

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.766
How are you feeling better?

12
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.733
Much better, thank you Mr. Chen for sending me back

13
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.500
Why does it always feel weird?

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.733
I don't think you really want to thank me, do you?

15
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.266
I mean it.

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.800
Then don't you think I'm self-righteous?

17
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.600
How could Mr. Chen be self-righteous?

18
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.600
That domineering and unreasonable

19
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.966
How could it be that in addition to being handsome and rich

20
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.600
What else?

21
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.866
Of course there is.

22
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.366
I can't even count.

23
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.166
Okay, then tell me a few paragraphs

24
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.700
Otherwise you know better

25
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.733
Chen Xuenan has no advantages at all.

26
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.533
Why can't I say it?

27
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:11.066
I think Mr. Chen, you are very nice.

28
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.800
Very good very good

29
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.166
Really? Well, you don't think I'm selfish

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.766
Are you domineering and unreasonable?

31
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.500
Mr. Chen, how could you be such a person?

32
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.566
People who dare to say that to you

33
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.900
I'm afraid I've already been beaten to death by you

34
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.600
But that's not what you said last night
