00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.466
Although I know he is not a mother of shame

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.400
But he only said these words to me

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.200
Why let me go

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.766
Let go of me!

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.700
Mu Zhineng

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.600
He was angry.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.700
Hide? What are you doing?

8
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.433
Apology or blame?

9
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.166
No need to apologize

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.566
Get away with accusations

11
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.200
What do you want a squeaky body for?

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.100
In my master's body, of course

13
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.500
Here to hook up with a man

14
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.866
Don't you dare

15
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.400
handsome guy

16
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.366
you

17
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.166
Look at me. Do you like me?

18
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.400
What's that smell?

19
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.066
Let's go

20
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.033
Your branch of solid wood

21
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.666
Let go of me!

22
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.966
I want to hear about the day my mom had an accident

23
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.300
So what happened?

24
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.200
I should say

25
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.700
Do you love it?

26
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.566
I forgot that I shouldn't be in front of you again

27
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.033
I'm leaving now.

28
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.266
I'm going to stop now

29
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.766
Why do you want to stop, I have to say it

30
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.233
Who do you think you are?

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.866
let go

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Chen Xunan

33
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.366
I used to be stupid

34
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.100
Being bullied by you every day

35
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.000
Why do you have to listen to me?

36
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.966
Even if you listened carefully to me before

37
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.666
Won't do that to me

38
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.766
These men

39
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.366
You have someone by your side who is sincere and sincere to you

40
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.466
Is anyone willing to tell you the truth?

41
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.866
You are a poor man

42
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.900
From now on

43
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.100
I silently support

44
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.166
It has nothing to do with you anymore
