00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.800
I've asked Mrs. Chen to tidy up your room

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.200
You will live with me from now on

3
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.366
Lucy

4
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.833
It's really my Lucy

5
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.300
You really like Lucy

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.866
I have liked him for many, many years

7
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.566
I have never seen such a handsome man

8
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.566
OK

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.400
Well, don't bother me, Lucy.

10
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.866
cut

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.633
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300
Mr. Chen Mr. Chen

13
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.066
Now I know my name is Mr. Chen

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.766
I'm about to be killed by you

15
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.466
I see you have no place to live

16
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.800
Kindly take you home

17
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.300
You come in and scratch me

18
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:01.100
How should I punish you? I'm sorry.

19
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:05.966
OK

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.066
What are you doing?

21
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.166
Feel unfair

22
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.433
Can kiss back

23
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.733
I'm not targeting you either.

24
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:18.966
I'm targeting Lucy

25
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.666
I don't particularly like these two words

26
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.000
If you ever hold two words in front of me again

27
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.066
I see you and kiss you once

28
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.900
Do you want to kiss so many fans who like Lucy?

29
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100
I'm only targeting you.

30
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.233
Why does it feel like a confession?

31
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.266
Mr. Chen is so late

32
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.933
You should be sleepy.

33
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.166
Let you rest well

34
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.800
Why does Mr. Chen want me to stay with you?

35
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.600
Nope.

36
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.966
Can you play Mr. Chen? Give me your phone.

37
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.700
Who are you looking at my picture tonight?

38
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.500
Have a good rest.

39
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.800
I will take you to the rhythm of Professor Yangchuan tomorrow

40
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.066
Professor Yangchuan is not allowed to delete my photos

41
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.833
God, why is there such a person in this world?
