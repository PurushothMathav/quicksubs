1
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.666
Mr. Chen

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.600
sick

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
Uh, no more slaps.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.600
No, Mr. Chen

5
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.233
Did you hear it wrong?

6
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:17.466
Who just said they were going to shave my eyebrows?

7
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.666
And make me kneel down and apologize

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.000
Do you still want next month's salary?

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.766
Mr. Shen, I was wrong

10
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.200
Please forgive me.

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.900
Muzhizhi

12
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.866
Your first project

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Go well

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.866
Muzhizhi is a good way

15
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.333
I seduced the president on my first day at work

16
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.566
Don't talk nonsense

17
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.733
I'm talking nonsense, didn't everyone see it?

18
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.733
So you don't have to work hard.

19
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.166
Ling Peixi sees the upper position

20
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.366
I said I didn't

21
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.066
Why did the president give you the project without anything?

22
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.100
Don't think you can rise to power by seducing the boss

23
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.000
Mr. Chen is not as good as you think

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.600
Get it together, everyone, work hard

25
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.700
After all, we don't want to play tricks

26
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.766
I said I'm not okay.

27
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.266
Then you can talk to me about your grades.

28
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.800
The stocks are all analyzed

29
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.200
So, what do you guys think?

30
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.366
Rainbow Enterprises stock will rise sharply tomorrow

31
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.366
The line of the rainbow is very low.

32
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.000
I think they will go up tomorrow.

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.766
It is recommended to buy a machine before 6 o'clock today.

34
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.666
Good for tomorrow morning's trading

35
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.866
OK, buy a rainbow.

36
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:32.766
adjourn

37
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.200
Rainbow, this will be obviously sluggish.

38
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.100
People who play stocks usually don't buy them.

39
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.066
You actually suggested that Mr. Chen buy this stock

40
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.500
See how you will be favored tomorrow

41
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.700
Who is afraid of whom
