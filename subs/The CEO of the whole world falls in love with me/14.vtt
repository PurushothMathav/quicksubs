00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.766
Mr. Chen's report for this week

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.966
Where are you going dressed like that?

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm going to make up class

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm about to hand in the paper, where can I make up for it?

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.800
Passport week

6
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.333
Is it inappropriate for you to dress like this?

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.233
What's wrong with that?

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.100
I don't think it's appropriate for you to dress like this.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.566
One student, one professor.

10
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.700
Being seen by others dressed like this to make up lessons

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.100
I thought there was something wrong with our company's corporate culture

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.300
Change it.

13
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.133
What are you doing? Which student are you meeting?

14
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.533
See the teacher go out dressed like this?

15
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.400
Why do you keep interfering in my life?

16
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.800
Just because I'm your boss

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.966
I don't want it, right?

18
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.300
Then you can stay in the company and work overtime all night today

19
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.400
I'm not going anywhere.

20
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.033
You and I didn't dress like this to go to class

21
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.866
There is a class reunion tonight

22
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.200
class reunion

23
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.400
School party

24
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.766
Everyone dresses like this

25
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.866
I was going to rush over after class

26
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.866
But I'm running out of time, wait a minute.

27
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.066
Help me get 20 sets of one-size-fits-all women's clothing. Yes.

28
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.500
Be conservative
