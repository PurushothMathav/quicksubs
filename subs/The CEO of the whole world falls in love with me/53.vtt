00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.866
You won't go to his company to wait for him today.

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.866
Not going.

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.966
I'm so tired and I can't wait for anyone every time I go.

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.433
How dare the damn assistant lie to me

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.100
Konoshi understands

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:11.966
Mr. Chen

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.166
You've been waiting for a long time. What's the matter?

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.666
Ah, it's nothing, I'll come out and get some air

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.200
You should be busy first, okay?

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.366
Go, Mr. Chen, go, that's right

11
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.266
The uncle who cleaned the toilet didn't come today

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.600
Go and cover for him

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.566
Why don't you go?

14
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:30.866
I'm on my way.

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.866
also right

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.400
That big pig hoof wasted your kindness

17
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.600
But it doesn't matter.

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.733
Wan Group is about to have a problem

19
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.466
When Chen Junnan goes bankrupt, I'll see how he bullies you

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.366
What do you mean?

21
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.666
Very relieved, right?

22
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.600
Chen Xunan is about to go bankrupt

23
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.566
Are you very relieved? What did you say?

24
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.466
According to my lucky physique

25
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.933
Chen Xunan's company invested in an overseas project

26
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.900
The project immediately encountered a sliding iron furnace

27
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.966
Then what? Are you going to help him?

28
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.333
Can't you just watch death?

29
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.533
Nothing.

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.033
I just want him to get all the funds back quickly

31
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.066
Otherwise, the Wan Group will usher in the history of history

32
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.400
The greatest financial crisis

33
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.633
No entry without an appointment

34
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.266
Please help me inform

35
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.900
I'm looking for Chen Xunan in a hurry

36
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.800
Do you think any cat or dog can meet?

37
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.766
Asahi's?

38
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.500
Sunan doesn't mind if you stay for so long

39
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.800
He will never see again

40
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.400
But I'm looking for him urgently

41
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.800
Boom out, Xu Nan doesn't want to see this woman

42
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.966
Please leave.
