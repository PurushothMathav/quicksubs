00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.066
brother

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.366
Zhizhi is my mom, she talks like that

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.500
Don't take it to heart.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.900
I'm fine, brother, go in first

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.133
Lest aunt worry

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.500
Help me take care of my dad

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.766
You're all right, I'm all right

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.566
Just laugh

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.500
Haha brother

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.333
Why are you still acting like a child?

11
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.500
Then you should treat children like children, right?

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.100
I am not a child

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.333
It's getting late.

14
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.700
Don't go back to school today

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.700
Find a hotel nearby, but

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.366
Don't fit

17
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.800
Eat and live, brother, all-inclusive, let's go!

18
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.633
Please ask for a room

19
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.666
Yeah, he lives alone.

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.666
Isn't it true haha

21
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.866
What's going on today?

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.266
Why are people looking at me like that?

23
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.600
What did Mr. Chen say?

24
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.633
I just wanted to ask how much you know about epitaphs

25
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.700
What do you mean?

26
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.400
I recently heard some rumors about him

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.200
This appears in our company.

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.100
Photos from the internal forum this morning

29
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.833
Please see if this is ink paper.

30
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.466
Are you free?

31
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.366
Ah, I'm not idle

32
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.566
I have a job boss

33
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.066
Did you hear?

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.266
Companies know

35
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.266
Well, looking at him, I think he's short of money

36
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.366
I didn't expect to sell my body

37
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:31.400
I heard that you are not a lady outside?
