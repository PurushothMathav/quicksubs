00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.133
What about me? I'm a cat.

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.600
I'm not Muzhizhi

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.533
I'm not afraid of you, aren't you going to be quiet as ever?

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.266
I won't let you go.

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.700
Let go of me! I'm going!

6
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.166
ACHOO

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.466
Mr. Chen Mr. Chen

8
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.300
Didn't you bite me well just now?

9
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.000
It wasn't me just now

10
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.666
It's my cat.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.766
Muzhi Zhi

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.466
I didn't even know you could classify personalities

13
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.566
Acting so well

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.866
Now it's Muzhizhi

15
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.700
Are you going to play the cat again in a while?

16
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.833
Gerushi's

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.033
Well, I know you don't like me in your heart

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.600
It doesn't matter, as long as you know me.

19
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.033
You let me go

20
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.300
I thought you would believe me.

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.666
It's not that I don't believe it.

22
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.866
It's just that you just told me

23
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.200
There is a cat living in your body

24
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.400
It's incredible.

25
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.600
After I got hit by you last time

26
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.800
The Soul of My Cat

27
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.666
It was knocked into my body

28
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.100
Since then, he has had two souls in one body

29
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.033
Why can't you always believe what I say?

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.066
Okay, okay.

31
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.466
I believe you can't

32
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.600
It's true. It's true.

33
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.800
Go and put on your makeup

34
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.300
I'll wait for you. Hello.
