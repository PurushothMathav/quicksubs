00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.500
Master, please rest early.

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.333
Sister Chen, do you also think I am selfish and narcissistic?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.200
How can the young master be a selfish person?

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.100
If the young master hadn't saved our family

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.366
My son has long been ill and died

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.800
But some people think so

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.100
Otherwise he won't go

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.866
Are you talking about Miss Mu?

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.066
Did the young master find him?

10
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.500
I found it, but he seems to hate me

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.166
Sister Chen, tell me the truth

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.400
I really have nothing but money

13
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.700
Isn't there any advantage?

14
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.100
The young master is sometimes a bit selfish and domineering

15
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.100
You said so, that's it, but it's okay

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.033
I decided to bring him back.

17
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.200
Hey, young master, where are you going so late?

18
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.533
today

19
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.466
The assistant gave me the address of their home

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.466
I'll go find him.

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.533
Mr. Chen, maybe they are just good friends

22
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.400
What a good friend

23
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.033
Close to midnight ashes

24
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.666
Mr. Chen, if you want to recover Miss Mu

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.433
You have to learn to be gentle

26
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.400
Now girls like to be gentle

27
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.566
How gentle

28
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.433
You learn songs, Professor Yang Chuan

29
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.866
Professors, thank you for sending me back. It's cold

30
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.566
I caught a cold when I went back tonight.

31
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.766
I know it's cold.

32
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.633
And let Squeak stand here for so long

33
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.166
I remember.

34
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.100
How did you know I was on a business trip?

35
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.166
You got someone to follow me again?

36
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.266
Why can he know that I can't?

37
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.233
But he never interfered with me.

38
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.000
Professor Ke, I'm going back first

39
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.666
What on earth am I not doing well enough?

40
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.833
Chen Junnan, what are you doing?

41
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.233
Dare to bully my sister

42
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.366
Mr. Chen, what are you doing?
