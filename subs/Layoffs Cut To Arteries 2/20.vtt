00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.460
Starting from today

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.440
Until the end of the project.

3
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.460
You're here.

4
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.060
Sit for a few more days.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.840
I'm your boss.

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.240
Is it reasonable to supervise this work?

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.700
It's reasonable.

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.000
Umm.

9
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.860
Then I'll pay that money.

10
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.540
I only have one bedroom.

11
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.420
Of course you're next door.

12
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.820
But hey, this is good.

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.980
Teasing you, looking makes you nervous.

14
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.400
Sorry, Mr. Guo.

15
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.320
The load-bearing structure of this photo taken by Hui Cong is really too complicated.

16
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.760
We want it to take at least another month to eat.

17
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.420
Where am I going to give you a month?

18
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.100
It's a cold lily month.

19
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.440
And you?

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.580
Why isn't there a bridge project yet?

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.600
General Manager Guo gave us a little more time.

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.740
When we investigate the problem, immediately conduct a public inspection of the fart.

23
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.540
Do you feel Lao Tzu's design drawings are problematic?

24
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.820
I said no problem, no problem.

25
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.800
Three days, finally giving you three days.

26
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.760
After three days, start working for me anyway.

27
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.300
But there's always a problem with this warehouse, I don't care.

28
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.420
If you can't do it, get out.

29
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.680
How is the river crossing project?

30
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.800
Don't worry.

31
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.920
The design problems have been solved.

32
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.860
Within 3 days

33
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.500
I know this is for you with absolutely no problem.

34
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.260
Hey, new moon.

35
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.740
How's the river crossing?

36
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.240
Don't worry, I've solved the problem.

37
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.140
Ready to work now.

38
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.820
I'm about to rest, too.

39
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.340
It's time to go back to the company.
