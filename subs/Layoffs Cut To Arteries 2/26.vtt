00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.100
The New Moon

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.260
I've been looking for you for a long time in the new moon, husband, I've said in public to call me "ministry."

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.060
What happened to the new moon? Did I make you unhappy?

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.340
Let me tell you something.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.200
You can be much better than Jiang Tam Duyet s daughters, so throw him away?

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.420
Am I not good enough?

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.360
Don't worry, honey.

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.700
Although the girls of Jiang Tam Duyet came out

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.580
But people's houses are big.

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.460
You wait for your brother to catch him.

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.520
They won't feed you anymore.

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.920
Hahaha, it's waiting for you.

13
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.200
You shit, you don't have a problem.

14
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.000
Go before the project is over or don't have these question marks.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.180
I just can't believe you're such a scum.

16
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.120
No.

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.860
It's none of your business.

18
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Isn't this General Director Ha and Hui Cong?

19
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.240
What are you doing here?

20
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.980
General Director Jiang, whatever you come to do, we come to do.

21
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.080
It's funny, the construction of the river crossing bridge and our Giang Vinh Group's new landmark project have been completed.

22
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.120
You're here to eat our leftovers?

23
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.140
Coincidentally, our Hengtai's new landmark project has also come to an end.

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600
Probably overtime.

25
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.440
How can those defective products made by your temporary stuffing be compared to our extremes?

26
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.760
Whose product is faulty?

27
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.400
I think you'll find out soon enough.

28
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.940
But compared to bidding

29
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.520
I advise you to pray.

30
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.460
River crossing bridge

31
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.140
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.600
The river crossing was designed by me.

33
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.640
Strong.

34
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.420
How could there be a problem?

35
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.200
You're welcome.

36
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.180
Something happened at the river crossing.
