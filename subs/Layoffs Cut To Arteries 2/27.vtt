00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.160
What did you say?

2
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.360
Praise, praise, what happened to Big Joe?

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.620
It's a small thing.

4
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.880
I'll go deal with it.

5
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.220
What is this, a cracked bridge?

6
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.820
Do as I say.

7
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.620
How about you do this before?

8
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.360
Strangely, didn't I tell Moon Moon this emergency method?

9
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.520
How did he know?

10
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.880
General Director Jiang looks like something has happened to your company again.

11
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.560
Assessment of Kwak Bridge Project

12
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.900
Do you still think your company s drawings are reliable?

13
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.320
Have you solved it?

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.580
It's solved.

15
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.180
All right, I'm going.

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.940
I'm just saying a little thing.

17
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.020
Can be solved

18
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.320
You call the whole bridge about to collapse a small thing?

19
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.060
When is it your turn to insult this rubbish?

20
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.020
The method you just proposed can only be used in an emergency.

21
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.640
Then improper handling will lead to the load-bearing structure of the entire bridge continuously deforming.

22
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.280
Eventually, the bridge collapsed.

23
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.900
Only fools continue to deal with problems this way.

24
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.360
If you don't understand, don't say dangerous words.

25
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.260
I don't understand what kind of method he just proposed, it's what I proposed, what do you say?
