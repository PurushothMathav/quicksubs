00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.400
I said the kind of emergency method he just proposed was me.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.140
Tell me Wang still works at the company, you fart.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.680
General Director Khuong, Hengtai Group is our captain.

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.820
We can't believe a word they say.

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.680
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

6
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.620
Kindness is like a donkey's liver.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.880
Honey, let's go.

8
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.600
Dear, is there anything wrong with him?

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.760
At that time I remember when I recruited Xu Thien saying I had no conditions.

10
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.860
I'm not a friend married in Giang Bay.

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.260
Cross the river, dismantle the bridge, use you to save your friend.

12
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.540
General Director Ha, I suggest you polish your eyes well.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.020
After all, men have no one to trust.

14
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.620
Tell me, men can't be trusted.

15
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.560
It's about dividing people.

16
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.840
This is next to me.

17
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.180
I'm very confident.

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.180
It s always time to talk about investing, I know.

19
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.380
You don't have to remind me.

20
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.940
So does the sum mean that I don't despise the Constant?

21
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.240
Mainly, Giang Vinh Group is stronger.

22
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.340
Lower risk.

23
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.600
So you're still looking for someone else.

24
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.040
Director General, think again.

25
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.800
Or you can take a look at my blueprints.

26
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.660
Surely you will change.

27
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200
What's always really hard work

28
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.280
Isn't this General Director Jiang?

29
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.680
Mr. Ha and I just talked about the cooperation of the relevant groups.

30
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.800
I'm not going to put it down.

31
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.820
General Director Ha, if you are here to invest

32
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.200
Then I suggest you return quickly.

33
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.600
I promise.

34
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.220
As long as we cool down and skyrocket here

35
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.180
There'll never be a little harvest.
