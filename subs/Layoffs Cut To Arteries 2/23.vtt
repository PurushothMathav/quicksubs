00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.880
July

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.600
What do you mean?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.400
Me...

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.140
Are you suspicious of me, don t you like me?

5
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.980
I'm just jealous of being rushed by the committee.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.660
A little worried.

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.580
That's good.

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.660
I wish there was something you had to tell me later.

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.540
Fortunately, I left an extra eye in the process of cutting messages under that phone.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.220
If not really discovered by him.

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.880
If there's nothing, I'll go first.

12
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.540
Then you pay attention to rest.

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.660
Looks like I'm left with Dori.

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.380
Mr. Parrot, I'm sure you'll like this surprise I've prepared for you.

15
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.400
General Director Ha, we have just received the news.

16
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.060
The Giang Vinh Group's river crossing has landed and opened to traffic.

17
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.980
The design document for the new landmark project has also been completed.

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.620
They're moving so fast.

19
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.940
Yeah, I heard they're going to make a blockbuster movie at a business gala in the next few days.

20
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.100
Taking the opportunity to pull out some investments to scale up

21
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.140
How new is this?

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.140
It's really technology.

23
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.000
If their plan is successful.

24
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.160
Of course I know.

25
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.380
But don't panic.

26
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.100
Our project has just been completed.
