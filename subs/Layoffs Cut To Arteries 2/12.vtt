1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.980
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.840
Out of the way!

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.720
Xu Thien is a person of our Hengtai Group.

4
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.980
You are the chairman of Hengtai Group.

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.620
What's the news?

6
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.140
Ha Thi Di, why are you here?

7
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.260
Is there a problem?

8
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.100
Don't forget, you sent me a letter in college.

9
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.420
But here I am.

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.980
Don't worry.

11
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.380
Giang is always so early in the morning.

12
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.420
Dealing with a laid-off employee

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.520
Giang Vinh Group is really a great prestige.

14
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.560
General Director Xiao we are talking at a high level.

15
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.800
Have your talk job.

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.600
The head's idea is mine.

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.680
What can't be said

18
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.980
Moreover, it is this Promise that deliberately undermines your project.

19
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.940
Caused the current accident of our company.

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.040
I handled it like that no problem.

21
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.180
Giang's friendship

22
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.720
Did you ask your father?

23
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.920
What is the reason for the promise?

24
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.900
I asked.

25
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.900
So what?

26
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.920
A thief steals someone else's work and becomes his own achievement.

27
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.500
Stealing someone else's work.

28
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.520
That's what the thief Giang said.

29
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.640
That's what my father said.

30
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.020
Is there a problem?

31
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.880
All right.

32
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.500
Then I have nothing to say.

33
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.940
God, they'll ask you.

34
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.720
Kick you out now.

35
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.860
Hengtai Group we absolutely will not

36
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.060
Do you want to join our Hengtai Group?

37
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.540
Hengtai Group uses 20% stake

38
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.920
And 10 million annual salary to hire you.

39
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.420
20% of staff

40
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.820
Annual salary

41
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.020
When's the right time? Do you know what you're talking about?

42
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.940
It's not about money.

43
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.980
What's going on?
