00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.540
Now I really suspect that you are maliciously undermining my own project.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.060
What the hell are you talking about?

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.080
From Heaven, stop pretending.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.620
The whole department knows you went to the construction site by yourself.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.160
Coincidentally, after you left, there was a problem with the construction site.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.620
And you said you didn't.

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.460
Crazy, who are you scolding?

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.580
Let me go, security?

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.280
What are you doing?

10
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.200
From Heaven, what are you here for, I'll tell you.

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.240
Bankrupt

12
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.380
Lao Tzu is an official

13
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.480
Truth. What do you want?

14
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.500
Do people like you only think what matches your expectations is called the truth?

15
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.620
Forget it, talking too much is useless.

16
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.280
Look what caught.

17
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.380
We have to see who will cry in the end.

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.000
You don't owe the coffin no tears, do you?

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.840
You bully us Giang is a girl who doesn t dare to touch you, right?

20
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.820
General Manager Zhang, we should show this guy some color.

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Xu Thien, I don't want to do too great because you are a former employee of Jiang Vinh.

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.300
You forced me.

23
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.600
It can't be divided.

24
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.300
Starting today, any building materials that renew will not give me the face of the Giang Vinh Group.

25
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.460
As you wish.

26
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.140
Now you can have.

27
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400
Get out of this business.

28
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.140
I'm really curious right now.

29
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.940
This decision is yours.

30
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.760
General Director Jiang knows you. General Director Jiang said it.

31
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.660
You don t have to go through the eyes of the president...

32
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.700
What are you?

33
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.880
General Director Jiang, what do you say?

34
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.900
That's enough.

35
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.820
Call the police and take this person to the police station.

36
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.900
Wait a minute.
