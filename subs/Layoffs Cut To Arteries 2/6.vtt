00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.100
What?

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.320
Dad.

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.880
Isn't he a landlord?

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.820
Project Manager

5
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.540
Why are you asking me?

6
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.880
You don't know anything.

7
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.640
He's, so with the gold medal of the design award

8
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.860
The creative cycle comes from exploring creativity.

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.820
It's not.

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.800
Well, anyway.

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.560
Take care of him for me.

12
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.180
He's the lifeblood of our company.

13
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.400
Chairman, it seems like you really care about Mr. Hui.

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.400
At first to take him to the company.

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.020
How much work I've put in, it's not that you don't know.

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.820
Jiang Bay Group can have glory today

17
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.420
He made it by hand.

18
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.540
Maybe God cares about me.

19
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.940
If it wasn't for that little Guo Cheng who stole Xu Thien's blueprints.

20
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.780
I really can't invite him.

21
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.060
Ha ha ha ha

22
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.440
Have you found the information of the Lord?

23
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.680
HR still has no information.

24
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.620
General Director Jiang, isn't that a big boss?

25
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.720
Did I really remember wrong?

26
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.100
The Reproductive Life Project is not Quach Thanh's.

27
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.200
It's Guo City, that's right.

28
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.400
Oh, I know.

29
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.080
It must be that Hui Thien faked a resume to trick us president through the back door to the company.

30
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.740
So the new employee doesn't have his information.

31
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.920
It's shameless.

32
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.880
I guess so.

33
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.060
Or are you smart?

34
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.520
But now I'm recovering.

35
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.860
It's better not to tell him first.

36
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.520
Does General Director Jiang want me to call you for that process?

37
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.820
Let's talk.

38
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.400
Very handsome, high level of education.

39
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.460
No, I have a friend.

40
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.000
Better than him.

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.940
It turns out that our Master Giang already has the heart to belong.

42
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.420
Are you a classmate or a friend?

43
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.680
General Director Zhang is no good.

44
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.360
There's a problem with the river crossing.

45
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.240
What's going on?

46
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.680
People at the construction site said there was a problem with a classmate.

47
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.060
They're just looking for fictional connections.
