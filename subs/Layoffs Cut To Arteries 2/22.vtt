1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.720
Next is our most important phase.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.200
Heavy duty.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
Everybody, please.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.040
Rest assured.

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.700
From today, double your pay.

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.880
It's not just that.

7
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.300
There are additional bonuses after completing the project.

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.600
Dividend for each project

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
Don't worry.

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.260
Our Hengtai Group will definitely not abuse every project.

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.040
Don't worry.

12
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.320
We will definitely complete the project on time.

13
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.720
That's right, why is the general manager waiting for our good news, not Jiang Bay?

14
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.880
There's a word here.

15
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.900
Let's get together.

16
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.100
There's a problem, if we do this.

17
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.600
Waste products

18
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.700
A pile of shit.

19
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.300
Injustice does not speak.

20
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.680
You have to talk properly.

21
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.020
A little broken arm.

22
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.540
What am I raising you for?

23
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.740
50% marry me.

24
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.040
Just come here.

25
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.540
If it can't be completed by the deadline, stop.

26
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.600
You guys have one thing.

27
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.860
Get out!

28
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.740
What's going on?

29
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.620
This is not like my previous scene.

30
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.940
Why did Imuko turn out like this?

31
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.340
brother

32
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.720
There are no outsiders here.

33
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.980
You can use everyday life.

34
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.100
The New Moon

35
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.120
Don't you all call people Moon Moon on the Internet?

36
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.060
Oh.

37
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.140
I'm just not used to it.

38
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.660
Not familiar.

39
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.540
Is that right?

40
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.540
Mr. Sakura, you.

41
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.340
Is it really a process?
