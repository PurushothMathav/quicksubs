00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.160
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.780
I mean...

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.740
From Heaven

4
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.100
That's my brother.

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.300
You're waiting for someone.

6
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.320
After you deliver the company, won t you even have to pay for it?

7
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.880
If you don't understand, don't talk about this danger.

8
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.640
I don't understand the kind of method he just proposed that I proposed.

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.680
What did I say? I said that the kind of emergency method that he just proposed was me.

10
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.460
Tell me Wang still works at the company, you fart.

11
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.260
General, they danced with him.

12
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.420
They don't know how to write a single word about what they're saying.

13
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.380
Right?

14
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.940
So...

15
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.540
Jinmug, he's not scum.

16
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.020
So...

17
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.920
I've personally fired people I like for three years.

18
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.260
No, no, I still have a chance.

19
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.180
There's not always a chance.

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.460
Because I'm better, General Director Chen.

21
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.540
You all show me him well.

22
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.940
These are the seven thieves.

23
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.220
I'll find you myself to solve the account.

24
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.100
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

25
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.500
Haha.

26
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.480
That's great, Promise No where do you rely this time?

27
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.480
The reason this time may be so favorable is thanks to your joint efforts.

28
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.620
Without you

29
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.880
Director Li, you've really spent money.

30
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
I told you, make friends.

31
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.060
I don't know the dividend that Hengtai gave me.

32
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.240
I have a betting contract.

33
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.300
It says clearly that your money is provided for free.

34
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.820
There may be further payments.

35
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.540
I'll report to you penny by penny.

36
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.740
Please continue to be generous, that's all I am, goodbye.

37
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.460
Go home and reward you.

38
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.780
Then I have nothing to visit you.

39
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.440
From ants

40
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.180
From Ants, you are Sakura Root, right?
