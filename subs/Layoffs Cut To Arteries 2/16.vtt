00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.440
I just took you on a tour of the project department.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.360
How do you feel?

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.460
Not bad, but you really lack a few powerful technologies to compete for the new landmark project.

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.460
That's right, so this doesn't bother you much, surround your economy.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.140
I heard that Jiang Tam Duyet's other girl fired your entire department.

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.940
So you've thought about it.

7
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.580
General Director Jiang, Mr. Sakura.

8
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.900
There are no outsiders here.

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.180
You can use everyday life.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.300
The New Moon

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.300
Don't you all call people Moon Moon on the Internet?

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.220
Oh.

13
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.580
I'm just not used to it.

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.980
Not used to this.

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.640
By the way, tell you quietly.

16
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.020
Jiangcheng's new landmark project, my father completely dropped it for me.

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.540
Brother, you're so good.

18
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.720
But you must help me.

19
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.180
The chairman authorized.

20
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.860
Jiang Xiaotian brought such a large piece of fatty meat and his daughter brought it to me.

21
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.400
There's no reason for ignorance.

22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.640
Don't worry, I'm not helping you. Who can I help?

23
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.800
Thank you, Ichiki.

24
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.720
By the way, do we want to recruit some more people?

25
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.840
Anyway, we're driving so many people today.

26
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.540
No need, just have me here.

27
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.900
Just heard the technical drawings of the new milestone project.

28
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.640
The promised man is almost done.

29
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.220
I can't believe it's cheaper than me now.

30
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.200
General Director Jiang is not good.

31
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.220
What's going on?

32
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.520
Employees of the project department have quit.

33
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.460
Now we have no one.
