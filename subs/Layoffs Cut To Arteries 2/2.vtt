1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
Resigned as General Director Giang

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.360
I did my best for 15 years in Giang Vinh.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.040
You can't say fire me.

4
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.000
Doesn't the company pay you?

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.680
Working overtime is natural.

6
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.160
It is your responsibility and duty.

7
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.200
Prolong work until evening without chasing your smiling face

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.340
Last night's earthquake.

9
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.920
The bridge may collapse during construction.

10
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.660
I'm just asking you now, is the bridge collapsing?

11
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.040
No, what did you say?

12
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.500
I'll tell you right now.

13
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.560
This company is Giang.

14
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.660
I said fire, I can fire both of you.

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.660
Pack my things for me right away.

16
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.300
Jiang Bay Group does not need you to be idle like that.

17
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.880
Manager Tran

18
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.000
We just saved the company's life.

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Take a break.

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.520
Who let people's new officials take office three times, so do we want to tell Xu Gong quickly?

21
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.060
Tell him to come back.

22
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.280
If this old lady had seen him, he would not have been at the station.

23
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.760
No, I don t think this old lady is stupid enough to move.

24
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.580
Otherwise, we'll play with self-immolating fire.

25
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.740
Guys, I hope you can make the company your home.

26
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.720
It's all about efficiency.

27
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.700
Don't walk around like those two, okay?

28
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.300
Total workers of Hui That project

29
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.580
What's that so-called project?
