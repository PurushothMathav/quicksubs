00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.440
What about General Director Jiang?

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.520
The promise is gone now.

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480
The whole company is messed up what's messed up

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.880
There is a problem with the design drawings.

5
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.960
Let's find someone to adjust.

6
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.760
But don't flinch.

7
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.680
Say something quickly.

8
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.840
But the designers who participated in the design revision yesterday were all opened by you and General Manager Guo.

9
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.840
No one can handle it now.

10
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.320
It's just a broken drawing.

11
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.860
Just do it.

12
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.680
How's it going?

13
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.320
The parents have called.

14
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.200
If not dealt with in time

15
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.180
The project stops working at any time.

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.840
General Director Jiang, what should we do now?

17
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.060
Gotta go now.

18
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.480
Continued delay affects the company's stock.

19
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.620
When the project stops working

20
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.820
The company is over, but

21
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.060
I've got another way.

22
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.280
It can be general.

23
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.620
Your head is not normal.

24
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.740
What time is it?

25
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.180
Ichiki, I'm in trouble.

26
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.620
I have a problem with a bridge project here by the Giang Vinh Group.

27
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.060
Can you help me?

28
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.100
Okay.

29
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.140
Who's going to find me now?

30
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.540
What situation?

31
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.900
You're in Giang Bay.

32
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.320
I can't explain.

33
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.860
Can we meet?

34
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.380
Okay, I'm nearby, too.

35
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.420
No problem, I'm nearby.

36
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.340
Follow me downstairs.

37
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.020
I'll see Imgo soon.

38
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.300
It's stressful, it's sudden.
