00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
From Heaven

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.980
From Heaven, you're Sakura, right?

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.020
You are...

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.060
General Director Yuetsuki Sakuragi

5
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.980
I see you've blackened me.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.980
There's nothing more to say.

7
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.100
Brother, you believe me.

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.820
It's Guo Cheng, Guo Cheng. He did something on my phone.

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.400
Not like you.

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.380
I've liked you for a long time, Mr. Sakuraki.

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.380
Stealing someone else's boyfriend in front of someone else isn't very appropriate.

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.360
Boyfriend.

13
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.020
Yes, Xu Thien is my boyfriend.

14
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.980
And we're getting married.

15
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.180
Living together

16
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.020
Married

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.240
I can't.

18
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.980
No, it's obviously me first.

19
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.180
I lost it myself, I don't want to cry at my place.

20
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.860
How could that be?

21
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.820
From Heaven, I ask you to start my normal day and I will treat you well and lend a helping hand to Jiang Bay, okay?

22
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.180
Give me everything.

23
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.260
I've paid it off for your daughter.

24
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.940
If there's anything else

25
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.340
Just find him.

26
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.160
Is that what it is?

27
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.220
I was wrong, I know.

28
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.780
Of course you're wrong.

29
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.820
So this works with us.

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.940
What's that got to do with it?

31
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.940
That's right.

32
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.420
You two are slow.

33
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.140
You're done.

34
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.240
Dad, are you okay?

35
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.620
Dad.

36
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.980
Dad.

37
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.680
Mom.

38
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.020
It doesn't really help.

39
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.520
You know, I'm very decent and generous.

40
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.140
It won't bother you.

41
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.580
I'm the backbone of the company.

42
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.260
He dared to drive me.

43
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.780
What's better?

44
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.780
You can drink now.

45
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.540
Of course, life has to have a sense of ritual.
