1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.140
From tomorrow.

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.420
Hengtai will change its appearance, what do you mean?

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.700
I want to join Hengtai.

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.840
Wherever you are

5
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.200
This statement must be sent to me.

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.740
If not the size of ginger

7
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.300
You want to send a lawyer letter.

8
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.820
Send it directly to Hengtai, and we will announce it.

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.660
Young people don't judge themselves well.

10
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.920
In that case.

11
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.240
Then I will satisfy you.

12
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.460
Come on, don't talk shit to them.

13
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.080
The Jiang crisis has been resolved.

14
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.920
It's not because those people are angry.

15
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.380
When Ichiki talked online before, he was very gentle.

16
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.460
Why do you feel a little impatient today?

17
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.560
In our work.

18
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.940
I hate little people who steal other people's work the most, and I've been really quiet.

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.160
Really? Of course not.

20
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.020
Important work.

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.100
Hey, General Director Jiang.

22
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.120
I'm Zhuo.

23
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.640
I want to suggest a new place to advertise and the Pacific Ocean.

24
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.200
Liangcheng New Landmark is our next core project of Jiangbin.

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.480
Are you sure you want to fight the Giang Bay?

26
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.380
I can only celebrate life.

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.060
I'm Sanichi.

28
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.780
No, how did that little fox know that Xu Tien was fighting?

29
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.180
You probably don't want to go to war with me.

30
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.540
Dad, did you move?
