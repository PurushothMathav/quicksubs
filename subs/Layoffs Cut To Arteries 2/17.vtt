00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.460
What is the cause of collective resignation?

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.200
They didn't say.

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.680
But I heard a little story.

4
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.560
They said their former colleagues poached them.

5
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.140
Former colleague

6
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.280
Kidnapping.

7
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.280
It must be him.

8
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.200
Director General Zhang, what should we do now?

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.520
The project is paralyzed.

10
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.780
If there's any more problems, we can do it at 1: 30.

11
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.940
He dares to dig, we can find it again, but in a short time.

12
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.060
Mr. Ichiki, can you help me think of a way?

13
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.880
Some engineers don't know anything.

14
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.800
They're leaving.

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.820
Let's exchange another bottle.

16
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580
I didn't look at the wrong person.

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.780
How's it going?

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.400
I've found some good friends.

19
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.580
Enough to replace the Giang Vinh Group project

20
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.100
Great, which also thought of changing the project department to my people to make more money, now selling well.

21
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.100
God, me too.

22
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.380
What?

23
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.700
Manager Chen, his ability is beyond doubt.

24
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.640
The rest of the staff were together day and night.

25
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.440
Time of cooperation

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.680
Great, it's going to be hard next, guys, are we just starting to tell Jiang the truth anyway?

27
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.640
Mr. Ha, please rest assured.

28
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.120
If there is a promise, there is no backward problem.

29
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.780
But recently Jiang Vinh's new landmark design has been half completed.

30
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.660
We're just getting started.

31
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.140
That person.

32
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.020
Well, that's just a published design sketch.

33
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.200
There are design flaws.

34
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.340
A lot of numerical calculations have yet to be completed.

35
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.220
If they keep using my sketches

36
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.700
When the jury will definitely go to customs.
