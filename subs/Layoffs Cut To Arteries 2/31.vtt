00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.480
Highlights today as the bidding for the city's new landmark approaches

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.560
Public project design drawings of Giang Vinh Group

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.940
Won the widespread attention of the people of Giang Thanh

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.380
In addition, Hengtai Group also participated in the tender and published the project drawings at the same time.

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.180
This little girl is a newborn who is not afraid of tigers.

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.480
Compared to us zombies

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.380
You don't see how much you weigh.

8
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.860
Steward Lee prepares the car

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.860
I want to go to the company.

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
Why does Hengtai Group compare with us?

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.520
Crescent father-in-law asked my position in the company

12
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.060
Giang total cut

13
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.180
What's wrong with this woman?

14
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.560
General Director Zhang, didn't you say before that you will agree to be with me after the project is successful?

15
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.720
- Do you remember? - Of course I do.

16
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.300
But now the blueprints have just been reviewed from your photos.

17
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.160
It's too early to succeed.

18
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.700
What makes you think that trash like Hengtai Corporation can pit us?

19
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.520
Have fun

20
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.100
Promise me.

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.800
Giang always has news.

22
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.560
How's it going?

23
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.680
The project drawings on the other side of the Hengtai estate though were much more perfect than we imagined.

24
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.020
But the level of attention across the web compared to ours is not basically the same.

25
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.360
All right, I told you.

26
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.820
What's the problem with that?

27
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.140
Come on. Congratulations.

28
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.240
Any other news?

29
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.080
What is Hengtai in a short time converging into a good soil standard?

30
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.600
I've just heard that their chief engineer is very good.

31
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.560
Chief Engineer Xu Khiem could not

32
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.300
Isn't he just a straw bag?

33
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.260
Hi, Dad.

34
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.360
Daughter, congratulations.

35
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.440
I will come to the company to congratulate you and Xu Thien.

36
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.360
I know.

37
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.500
Pay attention to safety.

38
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.460
The president is coming.

39
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.480
I want you to see the story of the two of us.

40
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.760
Big Brother is not good, Big Brother Jiang is not good.

41
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.500
Our new landmark project has been rejected.
