00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.500
You said fired.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.720
I'm right.

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.280
Promise Tien that you quickly do the resignation procedure.

4
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.440
Leave Giang Bay within three days.

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.980
Is there a misunderstanding inside?

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.460
Remember.

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.840
Uh, we can't follow the original sudden event anymore.

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.480
This is a big thing about human life.

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.220
Otherwise, there will be a serious accident.

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.080
This is Guo Thanh's leading international architect.

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.780
His design has won gold medals in international competitions.

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.380
Starting from today

13
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.520
He's the new boss of the project.

14
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.100
Do you copy?

15
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.660
General Director Jiang, I have the right to open people.

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.260
You.

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.940
And you're fired.

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.020
General Director Jiang Liu Gong they are former employees of the company anyway.

19
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.440
I didn't make any mistakes myself.

20
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.380
Why is the company's decision?

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.800
And you're fired, you open up to me.

22
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.460
Do you know who I am?

23
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440
I'm nobody.

24
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.080
But it's not you now.

25
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.580
It's about you.

26
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.800
The severance pay will be paid into my account within three days.

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.480
Not a penny less.

28
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.620
Maybe I'm missing one.

29
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.900
Interesting.

30
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.560
General Manager Ha, our department is all some small engineers, designers only.

31
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.500
It is not necessary to use such a large desk and such a good working environment.

32
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.620
Oh.

33
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.220
Oh.

34
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.520
There's also this computer.

35
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.760
This is our personal computer.

36
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.120
They're all from the same company.

37
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.820
What is private not private?

38
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.140
And now this doesn't quite understand me.

39
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.000
Interestingly, I'd like to know about finding someone to replace me as project manager.

40
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.540
Does the president agree?
