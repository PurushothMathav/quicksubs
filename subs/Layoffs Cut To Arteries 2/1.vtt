00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.320
Latest news: A magnitude 4.0 earthquake has hit this city

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.400
The river crossing under construction is severely damaged.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.020
Fortunately, there are currently no casualties.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.640
News from the manager's construction site

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.480
The bridge structure is severely deformed.

6
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.480
Suspected defects in the design

7
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.500
What to do?

8
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.020
Don't worry, I'll think of another way.

9
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.680
The manager couldn't solve it, we built half the bridge and all the piers collapsed.

10
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.440
The consequences are unimaginable, right?

11
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.500
People want to calm down.

12
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.060
Bow your head, why did you come?

13
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.660
I may have understood the drawing.

14
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.740
This design has a problem.

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.140
You see the load-bearing structure is missing.

16
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.600
There's a few more calculation errors.

17
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440
Simply does not achieve the expected load against the side swaying position

18
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.240
It can only be rebuilt.

19
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.760
If not, it will cause a major accident.

20
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.880
How could he be like that?

21
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.860
This is a big thing about human life.

22
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.380
Who said the picture?

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.860
This is when you're on vacation.

24
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.540
Outside the general hall directly broadcast strong, we build.

25
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.900
I heard that the president's daughter is looking for a global civilization designer.

26
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.660
It seems to be called Guo Thanh Guo Thanh.

27
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.880
Why are you still here?

28
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.540
What's wrong?

29
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.680
There's a man named Guo Thanh.

30
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.040
He's stealing your creativity.

31
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.180
She won an international award, you know?

32
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.300
Yes, Guo Cheng stole my creativity.

33
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.420
I'm impressed.

34
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.740
You're welcome.

35
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.820
Just ignore him.

36
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.580
Now we need to come up with a construction plan.

37
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.280
Manager, I need you to aggregate all of this data.

38
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.300
I'll tell you before 6: 00.

39
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.340
Hey.

40
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.820
Oh.

41
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.100
It's been a busy night, so go and rest.

42
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.660
I'll take a look at the scene, Tu Quang.

43
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800
You go to bed, too.

44
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.180
It's not too late to leave in the afternoon.

45
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.340
No, some places need to be reinforced as soon as possible.

46
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.660
I have to see it myself to be sure.

47
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.500
Manager, what is the origin of this word?

48
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.080
Change the entire design overnight.

49
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.380
That's great.

50
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.560
From this company.

51
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.080
But the president invited him.

52
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.220
What do you talk about at work?

53
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.820
Uh, I'm in charge here. You're Jiang Xin Nguyet, the daughter of Chairman Jiang.

54
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.960
During the President's absence

55
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.940
Assign Ms. Giang to manage everything of the company.

56
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.360
Holding the salary of Giang Vinh Group is talking here, right?

57
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.760
Not General Director Jiang, listen to me explain.

58
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.900
You two left work early yesterday.
