00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.880
I'd like to know how to replace me as project manager, would the president agree?

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.980
From heaven, right?

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.500
You fire a small project worker, you don't need me to ask everything of my father.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.700
Running away from work for no reason

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.680
You're not only unworthy of my father's opinion.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.100
Not worthy of being a director.

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.100
I don't deserve it.

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.860
Doesn't he deserve it?

9
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.000
What are you?

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.160
You could say I don't deserve it.

11
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.240
Do you know who I am?

12
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.660
Gold Award International Design Competition

13
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.360
Your current bridge project design drawings are all mine.

14
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.700
You said I deserved it.

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.900
You didn't say, I almost forgot.

16
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.160
It's just this kind of rubbish design that you haven't passed safety testing, and I'm considering doing it on the ground, and yet I dare to take it out and build it.

17
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.880
It's really murder.

18
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.840
What did I say?

19
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.340
Say it again.

20
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.460
Guo Thanh people are international designers anyway.

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.240
Dear, what do you have?

22
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.720
What are your qualifications for pointing?

23
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.520
Yellow armor

24
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.400
Do you know how he got these so-called award-winning works?

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.380
Shit.

26
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.260
Hurry up and pack up and get out of here.

27
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.860
If not, don't blame me for being disrespectful.

28
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.960
Okay, I'll go.

29
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.620
So please bother General Manager Jiang to pay more than 7 million project money I have paid to the company over the years and

30
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.700
The department has completed the bonus meeting of the two projects, we Giang Vinh Group always do not need individuals to pay.

31
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.060
Unless you buy it under that name.

32
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.780
General Director Giang

33
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.300
We can't lack people like that.

34
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340
Of course. About rewards?

35
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.900
Because now you are no longer a member of the Giang Bay Group.

36
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.700
The bonus is related to your chicken feathers.

37
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.060
General Director Guo is right.

38
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.780
Even if Guo Mo's bonus is sent, it should be sent to General Manager Guo.

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.740
What does that have to do with you?

40
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.400
Okay.

41
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.900
Okay.

42
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.500
Don't regret it.

43
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.840
General Director

44
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.220
Good luck with your project.

45
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.460
If any of you can't get out with him.

46
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.780
What else is thick?

47
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.940
Fake what?

48
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.580
Hey, Dad, you're going too fast.

49
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.840
It's a big deal.

50
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.900
Our company's project manager has already done it.

51
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.940
Don't do anything.
