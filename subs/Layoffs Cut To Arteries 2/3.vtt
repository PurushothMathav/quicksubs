00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.780
What's that so-called project?

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.340
He just got out.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.280
Okay, okay, there's an hour of work that doesn't work, right?

4
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.360
It's not.

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.600
There was a problem with the project last night.

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.000
He promised he'd stay up all night and come to the construction site. What was the situation?

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.180
Who knows if it's arbitrary to find a reason miners go out to play.

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.680
Let's go.

9
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.360
Open me up. What's this coin called?

10
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.340
General Director Jiang, don't provide anymore.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.040
What?

12
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.900
The salary is inaccurate.

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.400
There's a kind of leader who's absent on this day of work.

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.820
It's no surprise there's a team like you.

15
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940
Look what's on your desk.

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.960
You normally put your mind to these things.

17
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.120
I don't.

18
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.180
This is what my girlfriend gave me.

19
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.760
I don't even dare to cry.

20
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.180
You're fired.

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.380
This is up.

22
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.980
I truly consider the company my home.

23
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.820
General Director Jiang, I also opened him for me.

24
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.680
Look at you.

25
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.360
No wonder the river crossing project is in trouble.

26
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.720
From now on, the entire project will begin to repair.

27
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.500
You guys are really good one by one.

28
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.320
Here.

29
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.080
You have to do what I say here.

30
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200
If not, the risk can occur at any time.

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.240
This is a big thing about human life.

32
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.820
Don't be careless.

33
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.320
Hey, you go ahead.

34
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.580
I was fired.
