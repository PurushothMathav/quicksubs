00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.580
What's going on?

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.060
What's going on?

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.480
Most of the general managers just got on the phone from Li company saying that the design drawings even the most standard quantity calculation is not up to standard.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.460
It will work.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.440
Guo tung has just decayed the other one doesn't know why the road surface began to collapse large areas.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.340
The real food sector is also starting to collapse.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.420
What are you doing standing there today?

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.580
Go fix it.

9
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.860
If there is a problem with the answer, fix it quickly.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.420
Now you still have time.

11
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.520
Speed must be fast.

12
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.720
But my most important documentary project wasn't done by us.

13
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.260
If we should change

14
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
This is not what you guys do, this is what you encountered when you left before.

15
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.060
What do we say?

16
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.460
Thank you.

17
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.020
Listen to me explain.

18
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.860
Now the project has been forced to destroy the man's explanation

19
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.660
Why don't you redesign it?

20
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.220
The first priority is the river crossing.

21
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.780
Now if the bridge collapses and there are casualties, we're dead.

22
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.700
Okay.

23
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540
Why do you think there is also a problem?

24
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.500
It's because it's too much.

25
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.820
Do you have any fucking chatter?

26
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.500
Keep going, his family's original load-bearing competition has a problem.

27
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.520
Change to middle-aged Pham

28
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.120
This design only focuses on appearance.

29
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.360
Does not take into account the actual load and structure

30
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.260
We have responded to this issue.

31
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.400
But it's not enough.

32
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.580
Say we don't understand you.

33
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.600
General Manager Jiang, now our design has been rejected.

34
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.640
The bidding fair has already started to lean towards Hengtai's design.

35
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.140
What should we do, General Director Jiang?

36
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.400
How do I know?

37
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.380
But if this continues

38
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.700
Our children's children.

39
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.120
Hello general manager January

40
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.180
What the hell is your related collection doing?

41
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.080
Director General's fee, don't worry.

42
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.060
Bully, I voted for you.

43
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.880
Punish me, right?

44
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.520
Yes, you who are related can still stand in Jiangcheng.

45
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.540
I'm just like you.
