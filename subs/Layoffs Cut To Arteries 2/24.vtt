1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.060
Of course.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.200
Compared to Giang Vinh Group

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.060
Our progress is fast, not slow.

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.340
Also, they can finish two projects at the same time at this time.

5
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.860
I can only explain one problem.

6
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.200
What's the problem?

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.220
Do you remember what I said when I first arrived?

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.200
Mr. Ha, please rest assured.

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200
There's a promise here.

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.680
There's no problem with backwardness.

11
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.520
But recently Jiang Vinh's new landmark design has been half completed.

12
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.360
We're just getting started.

13
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.180
Won't you?

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.780
That one.

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.500
It's just a published design sketch.

16
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.760
There are design flaws.

17
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.940
A lot of numerical calculations have yet to be completed.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.860
If they keep using my sketches

19
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.620
There will definitely be trouble in court.

20
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.220
I mean...

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.980
They're always holding your draft.

22
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.480
From the results

23
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.460
Of course.

24
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.700
So the general does not need to worry at all.

25
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.900
If so

26
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.940
So wasn't the river crossing when I quit my job and emailed the Giang Vinh Group a reminder?

27
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.540
I don't know what the level of this guy is.

28
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.900
But because the river crossing project was given to him.

29
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.460
He has to carry the rugged molecules himself.

30
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.620
Everyone's been hard this time.

31
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.740
Take control.

32
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.400
The whole technical department has a 3-day break.

33
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.340
Take a break.

34
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.060
Full preparation for listing is

35
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.500
The promise is completed today.

36
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.180
Let's go clear.

37
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.100
Don't you know how to drink?

38
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.980
What am I talking about?

39
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.340
I told you you couldn't.

40
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.840
Drink.

41
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.900
Have you liked me in 10 days?
