00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.800
Can't come, are you alright?

2
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.533
Lin Xuehong, you not only slander people, but also beat them up

3
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.033
Do you think I'm easy to bully?

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.866
Bad molecules are street rats.

5
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.800
Anyone can play, right?

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.600
Ah I let you hit people

7
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.266
Mingyuan, everyone is gay

8
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.766
How could you be so heartless?

9
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.500
I'm cruel, you bully people and beat my man

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.600
Aren't you cruel when you slander me?

11
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.733
Aren't you capable?

12
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.800
I let you fight

13
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.966
Yuanyuan, how did you hit someone?

14
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.800
How do you hit Yuanyuan?

15
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.966
Yuanyuan, be careful to hurt yourself

16
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm fine with the thief

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.033
And fierce

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.466
It's just wrong for them to bully others.

19
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.100
Who bullied you?

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.900
Obviously you are the one who stole the right thing

21
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.000
Steal the real thing and get mad and throw dirty water on me

22
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.833
You are good

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.133
You asked for it.

24
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.533
You enter the palace without destruction

25
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.166
I splashed my dirty water

26
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.600
Can't I just pour dirty water on you?

27
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600
What, you guys?

28
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600
Take these first to explode the wound

29
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.466
I'm not going.

30
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.666
After we went to work in the fields this morning

31
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.066
And the real toffee and cookies were gone

32
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.966
He didn't steal them. Who were they?

33
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.800
Tang Zhiqing, is this true?

34
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.100
It's true, there's still 10 bucks.

35
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.833
My ancestral jade Ruyi is gone

36
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.833
Both Xu Hong and Xiaoxia can testify
