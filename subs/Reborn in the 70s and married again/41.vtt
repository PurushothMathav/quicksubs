00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.700
The leaders from this city are quite polite, aren't they?

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000
It's a shame I'm still so worried about you

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.500
If I remember correctly

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.200
This is your old subordinate

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.766
Are you all comrades?

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.966
Chen Gaishi, we didn't stop him from barging in.

7
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.400
This is little sister-in-law

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.866
She's really watery.

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.633
But a rural spirit

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.766
I'm afraid I can't enter the Rong family's door

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.600
Chen Qian is Rong Zhaonan

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.600
Have been working hard to transform

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.466
be proactive

14
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.866
Hey stop talking

15
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.533
He is indeed making progress

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.533
Good, keep up the good work.

17
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.433
Let's go check the next one

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.066
This leader seems like a nice person.

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.433
He didn't embarrass you, did he?

20
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.633
What's wrong with your hand?

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
They did it

22
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.333
It's alright, it'll be fine later.

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.500
How did that happen?

24
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.200
I'm going to get the medicine.

25
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.566
Don't take it, the medicine is too expensive

26
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.000
They often embarrass you, let's save it.

27
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.100
You care about me

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.266
Are we grasshoppers on a rope?

29
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.300
Don't be discouraged.

30
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.300
Days will get better soon

31
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.000
You can definitely go back to the capital

32
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.466
Are you so sure?

33
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.300
Well, dragons don't get stuck in shallows

34
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.300
Rong Grow Up, you must be able to do it.

35
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.033
You can go back to the capital.

36
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.633
Honor will die

37
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.800
Rongzhao male bastard
