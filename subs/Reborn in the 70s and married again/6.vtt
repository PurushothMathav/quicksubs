00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
What do you say he did?

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.700
Just go like this

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.600
Let's go

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.133
You think you're crazy?

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.566
It will be known by the people in the village later

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.966
How can you be human?

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.300
If Brother Li Yan knew

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.800
You and the bad guy who sent the renovation

9
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.100
Molecules sleep together

10
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.366
How can we do this?

11
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.666
You are strict

12
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.133
But the youngest brigade secretary under the commune

13
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.266
Have culture, have a future, and have rights

14
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.600
Ling Yuan, what are you?

15
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.900
Is that why you think you ruined me?

16
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.966
Li Yan has a crush on you

17
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.800
What do you mean silver dollar?

18
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.966
You are indiscreet yourself

19
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.566
They also doubt our revolutionary feelings

20
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.400
It's obviously your ideological and moral corruption

21
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.000
Sleep with the bad guys

22
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.900
You get out

23
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.200
Don't worry about us.

24
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.233
I suggest none of you mess with me

25
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.833
I can't come back here anyway

26
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.633
I wouldn't mind pulling another person to do it

27
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.700
You broke your own shoes, and you were wronged

28
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.800
Never mind.

29
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.933
I would rather he was backward-thinking

30
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.800
Broken jar

31
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.500
Hanging out with the bad guys

32
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.366
Let's ignore him in the future

33
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.733
Really, I think you're just too good-natured.

34
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.533
What a lady

35
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.966
Used to be your follower

36
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.066
I dare to lose my temper with you now

37
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.800
It's okay, are you all gay? No

38
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.200
I can't swallow this breath

39
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.266
Tell me about it.

40
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.833
I must teach this bitch a lesson

41
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.333
Fortunately, the only token given by my biological parents

42
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.200
It has not been accepted by Tang Zhen's life

43
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600
Who?

44
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.033
No one seems to be there.

45
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.366
Am I being too sensitive?

46
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.833
What is he hiding

47
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.433
It seems that this little girl

48
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:56.000
There are secrets
