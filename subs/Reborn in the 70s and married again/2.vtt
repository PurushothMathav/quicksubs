00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.666
Lin Zhiqing, I am now being found out

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.566
Who the hell is trying to use me to frame you?

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.766
But have you thought of a way now?

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.566
In a previous life, I was knocked unconscious, stripped naked, and thrown on his bed

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.100
He was also drunk with veterinary medicine and thrown in

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.100
But he tried to restrain himself

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.800
He actually crawled into the cold water tank and squatted for half the night

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.066
Runaf

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.400
Sorry.

10
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.066
I implicated you

11
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:26.866
before you

12
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.233
The most important thing now is to find a way to get out

13
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.833
Don't worry, no matter what happens.

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.100
I will help you.

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:34.733
Doctor Zhang

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.233
Let's get the certificate, let's get the certificate, what do you say?

17
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.666
You know, you've thought about it

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.366
I'm willing to help you because of a girl without a reputation

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.400
Maybe I'll never get married.

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.566
But I

21
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:49.066
But you are from the most remote mountainous area below the capital

22
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.766
For thought transformation

23
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.600
Here you can only sweep the cowshed as a barefoot doctor

24
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.266
possible

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.766
I can't go back for the rest of my life

26
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.300
Now that you know all this

27
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:01.900
Why is it still hanging?

28
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.700
Before you, you came here from the bottom of Lin'an City

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.666
Participating in rural construction

30
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.900
Informed that there will be new return places every year

31
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.700
But if you have anything to do with me now

32
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.633
I may not be able to return to the city for the rest of my life

33
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.700
I think the smartest thing you can do now

34
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.666
Just hurry up

35
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.466
Get out from behind

36
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.466
Hurry up, Dr. Shen, you are right

37
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.733
But the people in the village won't believe us.

38
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.133
Nothing ever happened.

39
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.700
But if you give me the certificate

40
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.533
Maybe I won't be able to return to the city for the rest of my life

41
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.900
Do you really care?

42
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.600
That's okay.

43
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.900
Just wait until this is over before getting a divorce

44
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.600
You were originally a child of the capital courtyard

45
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.900
After a while, not only can you go back

46
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.066
And he's got a good reputation.

47
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.233
Very high status

48
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.000
What's more, the impact of divorce on him

49
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.200
Better than being knocked out of the eye

50
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.966
Such a decent-looking little girl

51
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.066
The attitude towards marriage is so casual

52
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.900
Divorced women have a bad reputation

53
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.100
Doesn't he know?

54
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.133
But say he has another purpose

55
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.366
It was sent by those people in the capital

56
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.533
I saw it all

57
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:09.766
I'd rather be dragged into the cowshed and ruined

58
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.066
Go and save him

59
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.600
Happy bastard

60
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.800
Go down to the village to catch a stove and dare to play hooligans

61
00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:18.866
Let's go to save, I'd rather go and get married

62
00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:21.200
Bastard, I'm too late to come out

63
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.266
Have you thought about it?

64
00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:24.366
Even if I can escape this time

65
00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:25.733
There will be a next time.

66
00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:28.166
It's better to let them think they got it

67
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.800
Wait until they get back to town

68
00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:31.066
I'll figure it out.

69
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.600
Okay, just think clearly

70
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.533
Can you get me a dress?

71
00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:36.666
Those bastards

72
00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:38.166
Take off my clothes

73
00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.366
Ok, don't worry.

74
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:44.433
I don't peek.

75
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.100
Bullying bastard

76
00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:51.333
Get out of here

77
00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:52.800
Let go of Ning Zhiqing

78
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.766
Get out and wait a minute

79
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.666
Why is there no movement inside?

80
00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:58.466
Shouldn't there be very little action today?

81
00:02:58.466 --> 00:02:59.700
Quickly send the warehouse car.

82
00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:00.900
Don't rush it yet

83
00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:03.266
If you break in, you will alternate with educated youth

84
00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:05.266
All right.

85
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.066
Rong Zhaonan, you beast

86
00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.633
What would you rather do?
