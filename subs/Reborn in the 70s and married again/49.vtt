00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.166
Ah, I'm so tired, I'm finally done.

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.900
I'm going to boil some water and we'll wash together

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.066
Pardon me?

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.766
I said I'm going to boil some hot water for us both

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.466
Let's wash all the dust off.

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.700
Anyway, this shower has to be taken

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.966
That is, if you need help

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.266
Ok ok ok ok

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.500
You don't have to say it, I understand what you mean.

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.533
But the two of us are like this now

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.000
It's most like moving pork overnight. Well, how about you?

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.633
Give the pheasant and wild boar to Grandma Xia

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.633
I'm going to look for an old friend

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.266
That's not very likely.

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.366
These dozen people have a hard time dealing with writing

16
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.366
You two deal with the fourth floor

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.333
You haven't been hurt before, have you?

18
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.666
It can be dangerous.

19
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.700
But ah we put this wild boar

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
Into the old hunter's trap

21
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.266
Wait until he stops struggling, then drag him out

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.300
We brought some meat down

23
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.733
The rest is on the mountain, ouch, Xiaoming

24
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.133
It's too dangerous

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.466
How worried would your family be if they found out?

26
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.366
It's scary.

27
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.500
But isn't this a wild boar?

28
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.466
Either he dies or I die

29
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.966
So I can only fight with him

30
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.700
I'm just lucky today

31
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.633
Our village can add vegetables

32
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.866
Dad, we can eat pork today

33
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.800
You know who to eat all day long

34
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.700
This is what Xiao Ning and Doctor Ren exchanged for their lives

35
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200
Remember, take a few more people up the mountain later

36
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.566
Bring the pork back to work

37
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.066
Give the little family more meat, right?

38
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:25.966
multipoint

39
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.200
Don't ask me to keep it for myself, don't give me any more points.

40
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.466
How can you be so honest?

41
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.066
It doesn't say you couple

42
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.100
I took such a big risk to get it

43
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.066
Isn't it cheap to sell this?

44
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.800
You are a output victim

45
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.300
I have contributed to the village and the collective

46
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.800
This all contributes to the survival collective

47
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:43.433
There has to be a reward.

48
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.400
Real reward

49
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:46.733
And what about this?

50
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.466
Oh yes yes yes reward

51
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:51.133
I remember there were food stamps on the team

52
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.066
Cloth tickets or something?

53
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.200
What exactly is this talking about?

54
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.533
Later, me and the village

55
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.066
The other leaders will discuss it again.

56
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.966
Thank you for saying it directly, thank you, Sister Ma Hua

57
00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:03.400
I'm going up the mountain with Brother Huazi now
