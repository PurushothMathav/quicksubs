00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.766
Fortunately, the old master made me and Rongzhao

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.466
The boy goes to the school's small broken warehouse

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.966
Bring back some old furniture

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.266
Otherwise, I won't be able to live this day

5
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.600
He's so strong

6
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.466
The man looks tall and thin

7
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.000
Looking like a weak scholar who can't get enough to eat

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.466
So strong

9
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.066
These things

10
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.800
Let me move into the house first

11
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.900
That

12
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.600
First pot of newspaper

13
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.500
Repair the roof

14
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.600
The furniture needs to be repaired before it can be used

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.900
The room is too small to be turned upside down

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.433
Can you fix this?

17
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.866
I'll fix it a little bit, let's talk about it.

18
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.500
You have the guts to think and do it

19
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.466
Boss, this is complimenting me.

20
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.866
Uh, by the way, there's still a set of tables and chairs missing.

21
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.466
I have to move the warehouse.

22
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.433
I'll go.

23
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.766
You clean up the house

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.333
It's okay, it's a move from the government after all

25
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.833
It's a bit troublesome for you to go to the south gate.

26
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.166
I'll just go!

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.300
This little spy

28
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.633
Are you still thinking of me?

29
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:30.966
I told you he was a thief.

30
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.900
They not only steal from us

31
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.400
Dare to steal each other's tables and chairs

32
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.000
Now people are sick

33
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.200
I'll see how he explains

34
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.566
Everyone follow me

35
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.666
Make sure he reviews it at the conference

36
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.066
Tie him to a telephone pole for weightlessness education
