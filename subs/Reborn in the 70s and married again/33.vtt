00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.300
It's just right

2
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.833
If this is one of his ways of getting close to me

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.666
Well, I have to admit, it does have an effect.

4
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.866
It seems that you still have to be vigilant

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.866
The Sugar-Coated Cannonball of the Dieter

6
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.266
how

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.566
Is the shoe size so suitable?

8
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.400
Can't you do the math?

9
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.900
Then why don't you wear it?

10
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.266
I don't like the shoes I bought. Hi.

11
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.666
Then you can't go into the bullpen with good shoes?

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.133
Are you buying these shoes for wearing?

13
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.566
You put it away and put it away, and then you wear the old one.

14
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:44.966
Then I'll change it back.

15
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.433
Oops, don't change it now, you stink all over

16
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.800
You go take a shower and finish your meal

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.166
Dislike me

18
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.633
He should be the man of the sky

19
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.500
But the pair of rubber shoes that have been rubbed are not willing

20
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.866
Hey I said

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.233
Fortunately, our cowshed is at the foot of the mountain

22
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.066
It's still a long way from where most people live

23
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.100
I won't let you dig public corners every day

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.766
This paragraph could take you there at any time

25
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.566
Open criticism of capitalist habits

26
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.766
Let you do a thought check

27
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.400
If you feel like putting capitalism on its tail

28
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.266
Then don't eat it.

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.800
Why don't you wear clothes?

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.900
You go get dressed

31
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.166
Aren't I wearing pants?

32
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.800
Ok ok ok ok

33
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.100
Am I used to living alone?

34
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.133
Pay attention next time

35
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.466
The little spy is shy when he sees the man's body

36
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.500
How does this perform the task?
