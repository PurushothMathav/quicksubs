00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.766
Just talk.

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.300
What are you doing with your hands and feet?

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.166
You're making my face fat

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.366
I'm just looking at that dull stupid

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.800
Who would have thought he would be so capable?

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.400
Hey, you said that if you are gone

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.133
I don't know anyone else with good skills

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.466
What should I do?

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.766
You can't miss me, okay?

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.700
Even if I'm not by your side, sometimes

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.266
But it's also in your account book.

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.866
If I really lose you, my hands will be dead

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.266
You really hit the bed

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.800
What are you doing together?

15
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.100
Don't I want Qin Hongxin to misunderstand and think too much?

16
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.200
That means you still miss it.

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.233
You talk nonsense

18
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:44.100
Okay, okay, boss, I was wrong, please forgive me.

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.566
So do you promise me or not?

20
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.466
Look at your performance

21
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:57.033
Why are you sleeping in separate beds tonight?

22
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.900
As for thinking about it for so long, is it so hard to answer?

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.700
that

24
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.500
Continue to divide

25
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.533
how

26
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.866
What's the matter? I answered the question wrong.

27
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.266
Why don't you have any professionalism at all?

28
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.700
Who is it divided into?

29
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.166
This Qin Hongxing is also a passerby A, B, C, D

30
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.800
If you look in from the outside

31
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.300
Didn't you see everything?

32
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.800
This was before liberation

33
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.900
Let you execute lurking behind enemy lines

34
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.700
Once you are discovered

35
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.266
You will definitely become a traitor in a second

36
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.400
You don't need the Japanese to rely on words and deeds to fight.

37
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.766
How did I become a traitor?

38
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.600
Forget it, I still need someone

39
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.533
I didn't think it through.

40
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.666
Would you rather be gay?

41
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.933
With your current performance

42
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.066
It's hard to make the last episode

43
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.433
I believe you will complete the task successfully

44
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.800
If you give me another chance, I will definitely perform well.

45
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.900
So sleep in separate beds tonight?

46
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.766
No distinction, absolutely no distinction.

47
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.500
Don't let anyone know to avoid walking wind and frost

48
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.566
Don't be greedy

49
00:01:58.566 --> 00:01:59.366
I would rather be gay

50
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:02.933
If you don't force it, how can you force it?

51
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:04.966
It's not like we haven't slept together

52
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.366
At the previous lurking dike

53
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:08.500
Aren't all those fake ambushes in war zones like this?

54
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.200
Do you remember that bony flower?

55
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.466
What should I do? Although it doesn't matter if I talk about divorce

56
00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:18.866
Why is it still a little reluctant now?
