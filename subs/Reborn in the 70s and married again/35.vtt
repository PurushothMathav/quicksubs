00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.600
If you keep being so unreasonable

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.366
What else will I have to eat in the future?

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.366
I will never give it to you again

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.100
I knew you boy

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.366
If you marry a daughter-in-law and go to bed, you will stop being a human being

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.833
Don't go too far.

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.600
How did I go too far?

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.566
If you marry a brat, you will forget your roots

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.800
Don't talk so much nonsense

10
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.300
Pay me something, the old man is waiting to eat

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.733
Why are you so confident?

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.200
This meal is made by me, and men with makeup may not have a share.

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.300
Don't even think about it.

14
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.366
You you

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.766
front

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.300
Shi Liyan is a fan of the seven aunts and eight aunts in the countryside

17
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.800
Work every year to catch the autumn wind

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.566
Now you want to dream of me as a soft persimmon

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:37.966
So be it, Yuanyuan.

20
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.700
Blind husband has been sick recently.

21
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.600
Otherwise, give them this pot of porridge first.

22
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.566
Why does it have anything to do with me?

23
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.266
Mr. Tang was very nice to me before

24
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.466
But I'm really not doing well recently.

25
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.166
Take this pot of porridge as a grievance I owe you

26
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.433
It seems not easy to make Rong boss ask for help

27
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.300
What's more, I caused him to lose his eyes in his previous life

28
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.066
Freshman, that's all he needs

29
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.900
I can't be satisfied, of course

30
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.566
Okay, I'll take note of it.

31
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:11.266
I'll give you this pot, you have to go back, thank you.

32
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.766
Is that Rong?

33
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:31.766
My wife is going to trouble you again, right?

34
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.333
I'm really sorry.

35
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.033
The old man has something to eat

36
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.300
Potato porridge is delicious

37
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.966
What is good at worrying?

38
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.766
Have you asked Xiaorong for something to eat?

39
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:49.400
Can't do this again

40
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:50.933
I didn't expect it.

41
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:53.400
Someone's situation is actually more difficult than Rongzhuang Nan

42
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.700
Uncle, eat it

43
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.366
We still have grilled fish

44
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.366
Are you Xiaonan's wife?

45
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.566
You are also a good person.

46
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.766
Take this porridge back

47
00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.000
young man

48
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.400
What can you do if you don't have enough to work in the field, old man?

49
00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:20.066
You are so sick, how can you not eat?

50
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.633
You are sick because you are hungry

51
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.866
Hey, if you don't eat it, it's my fault.

52
00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:28.966
The bad ingredients are dragging you down

53
00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:30.600
Don't say that.

54
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.900
Wife you eat

55
00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:37.033
I don't like eel porridge

56
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:40.833
It's fishy. I don't like that bowl

57
00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:45.033
Old lady, you always do this to me

58
00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:48.066
How can I eat it?

59
00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:52.200
I didn't expect Mr. Tang to pick big manure and concave fat

60
00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:54.033
So gentle

61
00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:56.300
Tang Lao used to be Liu Guoyang

62
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.766
A Chinese medicine divine beast who has read books

63
00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:59.333
Such a good intellectual

64
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.100
It was ruined like this

65
00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:05.166
I'll go get them two more grilled fish

66
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.600
Don't you want to give it?

67
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.100
And we only have two grilled fish left

68
00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:13.033
It's not that you don't see how pitiful they are

69
00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:15.166
Working people should help each other
