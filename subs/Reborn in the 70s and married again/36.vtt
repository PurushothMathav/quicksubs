1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.100
Grandma, this is brown sugar and eggs.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.766
Supplement Grandpa Tang's body

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.366
Brown sugar eggs

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.766
How many days do we have left?

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.533
What are you doing with such a precious thing?

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.000
Nonsense this is good stuff

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.266
I'll make it for you.

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.566
Wait, grandma

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.400
You have to cook the eggs before you can put the brown sugar.

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.733
Eat undercooked eggs

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.566
susceptible to Salmonella

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.700
It's dangerous.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.666
What is sterilization?

14
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.000
It used to be fine

15
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.300
Don't scare people, you stinky girl

16
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.700
Xiaoyuan, how do you know about Salmonella?

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.433
Have you ever studied medicine?

18
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.800
I used to live next to the health center at home

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.666
I have an aunt who works there

20
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.900
Take me in often

21
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.166
I know some

22
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.733
So you know a lot about hygiene?

23
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.700
I told him just now

24
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.966
I used to be a teacher.

25
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.133
Stinky Laojiu threw a professor at Fu University in his early years

26
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.300
I studied ancestral medicine.

27
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.933
Opened a library, Professor Fu

28
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.366
What about grandma?

29
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.400
He is from this village

30
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.733
Just a landlady

31
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.566
The land of this village and the villages next door

32
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.866
They all belong to his family

33
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.300
His father works in a bank in the provincial capital

34
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.433
After the business flourished, he went to study in the UK

35
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.700
We met at a horse race.

36
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.000
Study in the UK

37
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.200
So awesome

38
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.466
Old yellow calendar

39
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.066
What else do you do for those

40
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.333
It turns out that the most uneducated person in the audience is me

41
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.466
Don't say that

42
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.866
You are the most

43
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.133
Don't you read books and prepare for exams every night?

44
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.100
You peek at me

45
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.966
You both live in my bed

46
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.800
So what's the secret?

47
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.566
Xiao Yuan, you also miss books

48
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.466
If you don't dislike it

49
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.400
I'm an old man.

50
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:44.400
I am willing to accept you as a closed disciple, do you think so?

51
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.500
Is it really okay?

52
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:48.366
You're crazy, your bunch of students and disciples

53
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:50.066
Make you what you are now

54
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.600
You forget that's different

55
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.100
Xiaoyuan is different from them

56
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.233
He is a good girl in his heart

57
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.733
Besides, I have to have a legacy at my age.

58
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:00.866
Not to mention

59
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.233
I saw Xiao Yuan

60
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:06.566
Reminds me of the days when we were studying together

61
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:07.866
Okay, okay.

62
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.800
Anyway, I can't persuade you

63
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.066
You old man who defends people, stinky girl

64
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.366
You heard me.

65
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.166
Dare to let him down

66
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.966
I'm the first one not to find you.

67
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:19.966
How about Xiao Yuan

68
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:22.000
You don't want to

69
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.400
Of course I would.

70
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.633
I'm just afraid I'll be too stupid.

71
00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:28.766
Is the children's clothing man here?

72
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.066
Ah, here it is.

73
00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:31.666
Secretary Li will pass
