00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.766
Why is that lesbian crying so hard?

2
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.600
He ordered so much food by himself

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.800
Did you sleep late?

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.066
The new Yowie and Coral arrived last week

5
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.300
Smells so good

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.766
The money for this dish

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.666
It's my food for a week

8
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.700
What a pity!

9
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.700
It's a pity that you ate it all

10
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.700
It's cheap enough to eat so much

11
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:47.833
He Yi

12
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.966
Hearts, stop crying

13
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.966
He Yi, who is crying, is distressed

14
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.400
What's up?

15
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.566
Brother He Yinan was taken by this township

16
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.200
The shameless fox spirit hooked his soul

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.300
Don't dare to go back to Rong's house with me. What's going on?

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.633
Tell He Yi

19
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.433
Brother Rong went to get a marriage certificate

20
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.066
Betrayed our engagement

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000
Okay, you can't swallow this breath

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.500
This scum really likes country women

23
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.966
If it is our compound

24
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.766
Or the girl who is the right subject

25
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.366
I also force people to be safe

26
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.100
I just like a country man

27
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.966
Isn't this stepping on my face to the ground?

28
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.066
Jiangxi son

29
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.666
Didn't your father come from the countryside too?

30
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.400
The woman forgot her roots

31
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.900
Hearts are difficult to eat

32
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.833
These few years

33
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.233
Look at his face

34
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.566
He will inevitably have complaints about you breaking the engagement in the first place

35
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.166
Okay, what should I do?

36
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.766
Silly girl man

37
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.900
It's for face and steps

38
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:47.166
If it was the country woman who took the initiative to leave him

39
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.666
Then it's not his fault, is it?

40
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.400
Okay, so what should I do?

41
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.500
I don't want to go to the country to find that woman

42
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
So I heard.

43
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.033
That woman is your man's best friend

44
00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.733
Are you a countryman?

45
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:03.166
Maybe his parents can talk?

46
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.566
He Yi is right

47
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.800
He overdid his best to Ba Nan Ge

48
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.633
His family is well aware of the world

49
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.100
Wait for me to check

50
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.100
Aunt Hearts?

51
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.233
Look after you.

52
00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.600
Me and Uncle Rong

53
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.833
I only recognize you as the daughter-in-law of our Rong family

54
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.033
Ok, thank you.

55
00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.833
I knew you could help me.

56
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:24.400
When I marry Nan Ge, I will definitely respect you well

57
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.300
OK. Mmm.

58
00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:29.766
Hey

59
00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:33.066
This broken-headed guy wants to marry scum

60
00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:35.433
It would be useful if I hadn't seen you

61
00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:41.200
But this Rong Zhaonan doesn't want to go back to Rong's house

62
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.566
He doesn't want to take back what he lost

63
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.966
It seems that in recent years

64
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.066
He's not as impulsive as he used to be

65
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.433
It looks more interesting this way.
