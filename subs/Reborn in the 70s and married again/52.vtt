00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.700
I'm back!

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.000
I caught a few more fish

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.866
Oops, just in time to eat

4
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.766
You said I went online to sell the meat for money

5
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.166
Yes yes yes

6
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.333
But if someone catches you in the black market

7
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.266
Then get it.

8
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.433
My girlfriend has a cold

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.700
I'll be careful.

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.000
You say

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.466
Otherwise, when will poverty end like this?

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.600
This little spy

13
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.400
Is there no funding for being sent here to lurk?

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.966
Why do you look like you are desperately short of money?

15
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.700
Don't worry, I'll be careful not to implicate you.

16
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.033
That's not what it means.

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.866
Your eyes and legs are broken.

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:40.600
Don't bring it

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.766
Tomorrow, I'll go to the county to buy you a new pair.

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:44.866
It doesn't matter.

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:45.866
actually

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.200
I'm not nearsighted.

23
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.400
That's your disguise

24
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.100
Actually, I'm curious sometimes

25
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.766
You can obviously hide

26
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.466
Why don't you just hide?

27
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.366
Did hide once

28
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.133
The second time, the third time.

29
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.833
Can anyone who comes to find fault with you for the umpteenth time hide?

30
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.333
But it made them feel comfortable once

31
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.300
I won't bother you anymore

32
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.866
But it's not the same now

33
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.333
If anyone bullies you again, I will beat you up

34
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.500
This little special

35
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.100
Why does it always feel different to me?

36
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.300
Do you believe me?

37
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.633
Okay, then let's eat

38
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.000
Since you're not going to go

39
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.066
What about tomorrow?

40
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.800
I'll go to the county and buy you a new pair of flat glasses

41
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.433
Play the whole set

42
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.766
Come and eat this fish

43
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.466
You put this

44
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.066
This little spy has an appetizing smile
