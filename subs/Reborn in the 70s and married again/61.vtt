1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.800
Why do I go out

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.166
You are blocked at the door and bullied, Brother Nan

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:12.500
Brother Nan, how are you after all these years?

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.200
This little fiancee looks hard to deal with

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.366
Comrade Golden Hearts

6
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.833
Long time no see.

7
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.266
Au Zun's visit

8
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.300
Can you do it?

9
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.733
Brother Nan Nan, this is not the place to talk

10
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.100
May I come in?

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.100
If you have anything to say, just say it here.

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.300
The house is too sloppy

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.466
Not suitable for receiving reserved colleagues

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.666
Nan Ge

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.800
I'm here on behalf of Uncle Rong and your work unit

16
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.400
I'm a little thirsty

17
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.700
Since the guests have come from afar

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.800
As long as he doesn't dislike our broken place

19
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.300
Just invite him in and do it

20
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.233
This little special

21
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.100
want to set information

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.233
Still want to have fun

23
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.200
If you don't mind

24
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.233
Just come in.

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.766
Soaked longan red date chrysanthemum tea

26
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.500
Yeah, don't you like to drink this?

27
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.700
I cooked some dumplings this afternoon

28
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.700
Some brown sugar left

29
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.100
I cooked some for you by the way

30
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.166
Well, I like to replenish qi and blood

31
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:19.966
Drink more

32
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:24.400
Brother Nan, I have some words that are inconvenient for others to hear

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.200
Rather than anyone else

34
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.466
She's my wife.

35
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.266
And it's the object on my account book

36
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.466
But he's really not fit to listen to our conversation

37
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.266
You know the confidentiality policy
