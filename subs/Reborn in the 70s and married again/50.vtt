00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.966
You two dogs

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.966
His family shared 11 kilograms of food stamps

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.400
12-Foot cloth ticket and 2.5kg stamp

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.500
There's even a catty of typical tickets

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.966
This is great.

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.566
It's just luck

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.800
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.566
Hey, I'm talking to you, right?

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.600
Never mind.

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.700
If it weren't for him, we wouldn't be able to eat pork

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.500
What's the matter, he just stepped on shit luck?

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.733
And the bad guys picked up four wild boars on the mountain

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.966
Besides, it's all collective.

14
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.266
What stamps did the village team reward him with?

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.100
Maiden cloth ticket

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.066
Why?

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.100
Where did you pick it up?

18
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.666
Didn't you hear what the couple said?

19
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.966
I fought all night yesterday.

20
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.300
Finally introduced the wild boar into the trap

21
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.766
But a little out-point error can kill you

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.066
He deserved to die.

23
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.066
Hey, what's the matter with you?

24
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.766
What's up?

25
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.100
Just that little pork bought you off

26
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.200
You've been listening to that bad guy

27
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.733
I'm helping you, not dear.

28
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.766
Come on. You

29
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.266
I think it's just gone.

30
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.900
You've been corrupted by that bad guy

31
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.566
I don't have it. If you miss Tang Sanzhen so much

32
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.200
Then you accompany him to remodel it?

33
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.866
What a liar! He's not been very nice to you!

34
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.666
I can't afford what you said, please tell me again.

35
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.766
I said you licked Tan Sheng like this

36
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.200
It's like being a dog's leg for a lifetime

37
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.900
You shut up

38
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.066
Why do you hit anyone casually?

39
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.166
You forgot that you were covered in feces

40
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.600
Who cleaned it for you?

41
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.933
You, I'll beat him to death today

42
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.766
Don't fight, don't fight, don't fight, don't fight

43
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.566
Blind date in this country

44
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.033
I just want to educate him well today

45
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.766
Lest he be corrupted by this bad guy

46
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.000
Obviously you are jealous of socialites

47
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.466
Said he didn't deserve the reward

48
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.333
People work so hard

49
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.166
Give us points at the end

50
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.133
You eat other people's meat and give it away

51
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.300
Really, that's a collective thing

52
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.466
Then he should be good at it.

53
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.700
Besides, why put the cloth

54
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.566
Tickets and thank you for the stamps in the pile

55
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.966
Give him all the tickets

56
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.533
The reward is for your unanimous consent.

57
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.566
Again

58
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.566
Without Xiaoning, you can eat wild boar today

59
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.533
Just the ungrateful guy

60
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.700
Like the disabled

61
00:01:58.766 --> 00:01:59.966
What are you wearing?

62
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.966
Stop flattering and really bully Ling Yun

63
00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.400
The last 10 bucks thing

64
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.166
Did you lie to him?
