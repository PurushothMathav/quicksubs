00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.000
Xiaoyuan Jianxin is good

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.166
I wonder how you are doing in the village

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.666
Is the home safe?

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.200
Big brother knows that it is not easy for you to go to the countryside

5
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.400
This 10 yuan is your pocket money.

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400
Don't worry, Mom won't know.

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.266
Wait for my big brother to be admitted to the military academy

8
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.900
I will go back to tutor you during the holidays.

9
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.200
Why are you crying?

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.366
You dare not tell your big brother.

11
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.400
You are married

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.266
My eldest brother is the best person in my family for me.

13
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.100
I'm sure I have to talk to him about it.

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.000
That's okay.

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.600
Just tell him directly that you married me

16
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.100
No.

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.966
Your people don't like those twisted things

18
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.000
If he has a problem with me

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.066
You can come to me directly.

20
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.300
What are you doing?

21
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.433
Beat you

22
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.266
Then he can try

23
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.033
My big brother will definitely have no opinion

24
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.133
But my mom and my brother

25
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.900
You must have a big opinion of me.

26
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.566
And he sent me these 10 dollars.

27
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.300
I thought my family didn't know

28
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.800
But they can do it with their toes.

29
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.600
This is less money to send back.

30
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.766
Come to me

31
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:14.700
I think

32
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.400
It really doesn't matter if you don't have a good relationship with your family.

33
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.366
When you become stronger

34
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.833
No one can do anything to you

35
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.900
You don't feel bad about your family

36
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.266
Is your character bad?

37
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.266
I don't have a good relationship with my family either.

38
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.700
Really?

39
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.600
But that's a long story, so let's ignore it.

40
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:37.900
By the way, this is the food I prepared for you.

41
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:39.866
And

42
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:44.866
salary

43
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.966
You are thanking me for taking care of you

44
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.366
That's too much.

45
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.800
Then my salary and all my belongings

46
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.866
Shouldn't my woman be in charge?

47
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.266
Who is your woman?

48
00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:59.766
It seems to be reversed.

49
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.866
I'm in your account book

50
00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:04.833
Then I should be your man

51
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:07.800
It's not true.

52
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.100
True or false

53
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.600
Anyway, I will give you my salary in the future.

54
00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.066
And I believe

55
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.366
You can double them very quickly.

56
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.100
Oh.

57
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.900
The co-author is calculating me and asking me to make money for you

58
00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:23.233
Why don't you want to?

59
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.833
For the sake of your sincerity

60
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.266
You are satisfied

61
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.066
I'm going to cook

62
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.266
Add dishes tonight

63
00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:42.200
You better not let me down
