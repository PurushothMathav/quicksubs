00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.700
Your foster mother?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.666
I'm afraid I won't let it go

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.600
Maybe.

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.433
Will find your school

5
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.566
We've got to do something.

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.633
But if so

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.100
Xiaoyuan's college entrance examination will be affected

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.066
Then I'll move right away.

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.966
I'm going to ask the old man for help

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't let them know where we are

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.466
This family is just disconnected

12
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.866
But my adoptive father

13
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.166
My brother and I are very nice to me

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.466
I don't want my mom to threaten me with them

15
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.533
It's before the college entrance examination.

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.700
I dodge first

17
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.166
I'll take you out after my college entrance examination.

18
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.166
Contact them again

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.000
Okay, now that you've arranged it all

20
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.100
I think it's better to move out at night

21
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.866
Don't be seen

22
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.866
But

23
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.166
The documents I took with you haven't come down yet.

24
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.266
Can we go?

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.200
It doesn't matter, I'll ask the old man to help me then.

26
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.400
Now that the policy is released, it should be no problem, really.

27
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.800
That's great. That's great.

28
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.600
Yueyue

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.000
How do you know?

30
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.800
I am not the son of my neighbor.

31
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.766
Did your mother take your name?

32
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.100
once

33
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.366
I overheard my aunt talking to my mother.

34
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.566
Between know

35
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.366
It is said that my name was given by my grandmother

36
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.766
Do you know which family you are from?

37
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.766
It is said that my grandmother used to be a nurse at your house in the provincial capital

38
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.666
So what happened?

39
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.133
When your family moved to Hong Kong and abroad

40
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.966
In a mess and in a hurry

41
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.000
They put me in a little basket.

42
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Put it in your ancestral hall

43
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.900
You mean you might be the main family

44
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.166
Your child

45
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.533
What nonsense are you talking about?

46
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.333
My grandmother is your little master's wet nurse

47
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.833
How could he not recognize the master's child?

48
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.300
That's not necessarily true.

49
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.300
Have you thought about going to them?

50
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.866
Okay, it's up to me.

51
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.000
But I'm going out these days.

52
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.066
Come back at the end of the month

53
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.266
You have to be careful

54
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.366
Take care of yourself

55
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.833
No problem, don't worry.
