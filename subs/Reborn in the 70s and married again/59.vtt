00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.166
I'm actually the boss now

2
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.666
And I thought about it.

3
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.133
I am a decades-old aunt

4
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:23.933
Rebirth

5
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:29.000
How does it feel to go back to being 20 years old?

6
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.633
And don't I want to make up for him?

7
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.033
Why does it seem to be tempted now?

8
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.100
Damn damn damn

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.866
Damn long-haired rabbit

10
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.566
Are you the class host?

11
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:49.866
Feng Zhuangnan

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.466
You are a firm believer in Marxism

13
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.066
How can it be casual

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.733
Was attacked by an unknown Tang Ying shell

15
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.533
Woof

16
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.100
He can't really go, can he?

17
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.600
Marriage, your home is calling

18
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.800
Go pick it up

19
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.266
Comrade Li Yan

20
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.200
Did you call my home, Ning Zhiqing?

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.100
White clothes in a car accident

22
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.466
The eldest in the family called twice

23
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.466
I didn't even look for you.

24
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.400
But the other day your mother said you didn't reply to his letters.

25
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.466
So what?

26
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.100
Woman, how did you become so innocent and indifferent?

27
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.666
The family has no overnight feud

28
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.166
And you did it wrong first.

29
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.800
White is the one who raised you

30
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.066
You should explain and apologize.

31
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.333
I have nothing to do with him

32
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.166
Comrade Li Yan

33
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.966
Please don't make an assertion and get involved in my family affairs, okay?

34
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.100
Hello, Mom.

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.733
You still answer the phone

36
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.366
I thought your sister-in-law wasn't my mother anymore

37
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.766
I didn't, did I?

38
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.866
You married a devolved reformer without permission

39
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.833
Seriously injured your aunt

40
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.733
Not a single phone call

41
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.000
He didn't answer my letters.

42
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.366
It's not about breaking up.

43
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:15.866
Then you will only scold me when you call

44
00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.466
You don't know how my aunt treats me

45
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.933
Didn't he just hit you over the head with a stool?

46
00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:23.066
I was there. I hit harder.

47
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:24.466
I'd rather not kill you

48
00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:27.500
I won't let you fool around with men and take care of your family

49
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.200
Is that right? Your eldest brother is in the army in Shanghai.

50
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.066
Your second brother is also a regular employee

51
00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:38.166
Your sister is the only backbone of the siege regiment

52
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:41.866
You can't do anything to help, forget it

53
00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:43.666
Also make broken shoes

54
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.833
Why don't you buy some meat?

55
00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.200
Mom, you did this to me

56
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.566
It's all because I'm not your biological

57
00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:50.366
Okay?

58
00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.066
What!

59
00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:54.700
Who is talking nonsense in front of you?

60
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.266
Who said you are not my biological aunt?

61
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.566
Just tell me the truth

62
00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.633
The truth will soon come to light

63
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.100
It's getting late

64
00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:24.433
I still have to take my stuff to the black market to see a doctor first
