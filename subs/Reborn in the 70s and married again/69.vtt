00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Know that black stones sell bones for money

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.866
I didn't expect to make so much money

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.200
Oops, I forgot to buy roast chicken for Rong Zhangnan

4
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.766
Rong Zhangnan

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.866
Ren scum Ren scum why are you here

6
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.266
Run slower, community handsome dog eats shit

7
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.533
I still want to buy you roast chicken

8
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.166
I heard your family is against us being together

9
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.600
What did that Li Yan come to warn me?

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.266
Tell me to stay away from you

11
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.833
I don't want you to be scolded by your family because of me.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.300
He also went to find you

13
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.100
I've made it very clear to him.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.433
And that's the defining characteristic of my life.

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.766
I know that.

16
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.466
Ningyuan, since we are together now

17
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.866
Even in name only

18
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.100
I don't want you to either.

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Give other men unnecessary opportunities

20
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.533
You are my object now

21
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.000
I don't know why.

22
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.166
I felt warm in my heart when he said that

23
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.733
As for your family

24
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.700
I'm back to work now.

25
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.900
They should not object

26
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.500
If they knew that you had resumed your job in the capital

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.300
Maybe I'll ask you for a nice dowry

28
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.200
Why not?

29
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.266
Just looking for you to find some good job or something

30
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.166
I can give it to them if they really want it.

31
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.466
No need.

32
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.500
One, we're not a real couple.

33
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.766
You don't owe me anything

34
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.700
Second, I don't have a good relationship with them.

35
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.033
I didn't want them to take advantage.

36
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.766
You have a bad relationship with your family

37
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600
Didn't your brother send you money specially from Shanghai?

38
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.700
And cookies?

39
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.733
My eldest brother was adopted by my parents.

40
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.366
His parents were martyrs

41
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.466
I used to live in our unit courtyard

42
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.500
My eldest brother treats me best in our family.

43
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.566
Forget it, let's not talk about these unhappy things

44
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.100
You haven't eaten yet, I'll take you to eat delicious food

45
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.466
I'm not hungry. It's okay. Let's go.

46
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.666
Eat whatever you want

47
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:04.433
Today we will drink this

48
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.633
Cheers.

49
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.433
Still drinking

50
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.366
Go back to the room to rest

51
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.200
Are you still opening a room?

52
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.933
This Song and Liang Ye have high degrees

53
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.066
I'm afraid it's not safe for us to walk at night

54
00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:27.800
That's not too high, oops, I haven't had any more.

55
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.300
Stop drinking and go

56
00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:50.700
What are you looking at?

57
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.700
You don't look good

58
00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.600
Ah! What are you doing?
