00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.100
Curse you bastard

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.166
I'm going to take a shower

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.400
You go to bed first

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.833
Why are you taking a shower again? Didn't you take a shower just now?

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.700
I see.

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.400
But I remember the gossip media in my past life

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.266
Overbearing and glorious man

8
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.600
The wife is also a second-generation socialite with a very good background

9
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.266
We're sure it's impossible.

10
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.633
I had to stay calm.

11
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.933
Earn money to go to school

12
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.900
Upward growth has been my main mission in life

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.066
That's right, getting a man is not in my plan

14
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.166
Can't let my love be said

15
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:43.866
sleep

16
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.100
No wonder some people can't resist sugar-coated cannonballs

17
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.566
But then again

18
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.500
This little spy is really capable.

19
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.700
But

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.866
Different from others

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.000
Colleague tomorrow

22
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.100
Why are you going so late?

23
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.400
It's getting dark

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.433
If you don't mind, take my backseat

25
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.900
I'll take you back to Brother Rong's house

26
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.600
Don't bother, the door is just ahead

27
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.800
You are welcome

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.000
Brother Rong and I are our own people

29
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.900
This time I just came to see him for my sister-in-law

30
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.566
Brother Rong has a fiancee

31
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.233
I'll be seeing him in a few days

32
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.600
You didn't know he was married?

33
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.000
It seems that this woman is still not giving up on Brother Rong.

34
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.800
But the old leader's task must also be completed.

35
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.633
Here's a newspaper for you to read.

36
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.800
These days are getting better and better, the future

37
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.200
Brother Rong will definitely go back

38
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.300
Yes, it's the end of December 1978

39
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.766
Reform is coming soon

40
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.466
I actually forgot about this

41
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.066
How about it? Can you understand?

42
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.800
Oh, I see. Thank you.

43
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.866
You are welcome, do you not live in the village committee?

44
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.100
I'll take you back. Go

45
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.133
It's okay, no need.

46
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.700
I really went by myself and walked back

47
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.566
You hurry back

48
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.266
You, you, don't pull me, I'll take you back, let's go

49
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:07.200
What are you doing?
