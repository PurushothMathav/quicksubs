00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.900
Are you crazy?

2
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.733
If I hadn't reacted quickly just now

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.133
You were pierced by my contempt

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.166
What are you doing?

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.433
I'm afraid you'll get hurt

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.633
Is the wound on your face okay?

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.233
It doesn't matter, it's better to go back and deal with it.

8
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.000
It's not good to leave a scar on such a beautiful face

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.866
Ah, beauty hurts

10
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.233
What am I talking about at this moment?

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.733
Who is he to you?

12
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.700
Should be an enemy

13
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.533
Like I said, you're not worth it to me

14
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.800
I also said

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.500
Whether it's worth it or not is up to me

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.200
But what about this guy?

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.466
Is he still alive?

18
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.366
How do you deal with it?

19
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.600
He shouldn't have come alone

20
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.466
It is not advisable to stay here long

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.800
Okay?

22
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.500
Cool at night put on

23
00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.766
Damn

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.466
A good body is easy to be imagined

25
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.433
What's wrong? I'm being fooled.

26
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.900
What? My legs are numb.

27
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.100
One in 20 years

28
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.600
The handsome face that can make thousands of girls scream

29
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.633
With such a good figure

30
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.900
Who can stand me

31
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.100
How long are you going to crawl on me?

32
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.000
Ah, let's go.

33
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.466
Rong Zhongnan, I have something to ask you.

34
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.300
What's the matter, how can you have such a murderous enemy?

35
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.800
And you don't sleep in the middle of the night

36
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.566
What are you doing up the mountain?

37
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.600
It's getting clichÃ©.

38
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.100
Ah!

39
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700
When I went up the mountain the other day

40
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.233
I met a herd of wild boars besieging me

41
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.100
I flew with the power of nine bulls and two tigers

42
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.466
Finally, these wild boars

43
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.066
Introduced and killed in a trap

44
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.433
And then moved the pork into the cave

45
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:56.500
Originally

46
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.100
I want to give some to Grandma Xia and the others.

47
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.033
Are they special?

48
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.466
I didn't mean to not give it to you.

49
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.433
I didn't tell you about this.

50
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.400
Sorry.

51
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.000
You don't have to apologize to me.

52
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.866
We're not a real couple

53
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.466
What you do is your freedom

54
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.566
What if we were a real couple?
