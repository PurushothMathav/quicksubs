00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.100
Pardon me?

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.633
I said I dislike you

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.533
Since I was relieved of my duties

4
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.300
When the idea is reinvented

5
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.766
Our engagement has been annulled

6
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.566
Then why are you still bringing this up now?

7
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200
Ask the new comrade

8
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.133
How are you so embarrassed?

9
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.566
Why are you embarrassed to leave?

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.933
I'm not sorry for you anyway.

11
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.600
We were supposed to be a couple

12
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.300
It's all because of the woman you sent

13
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.500
Almost didn't go down

14
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.066
Our marriage was meant to be between elders

15
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.000
self-made

16
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.433
It's not you, my appointment will be cancelled sooner or later

17
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.900
How can you say that?

18
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.200
Did you forget?

19
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.733
When your father was dying

20
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.100
I begged my old man to say

21
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.300
Do you have to protect your only daughter?

22
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.066
It is inseparable that they used to be a life-long friendship

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.300
So my father arranged an engagement for you and me

24
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.366
In case anyone goes

25
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.100
Disturb your life and that of your mother

26
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.166
I know. So what?

27
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.466
We're still engaged, and you agreed

28
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.566
The reason why I agreed to get engaged in the first place

29
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
It's because after your father left

30
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.566
I need to protect you and your family

31
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.500
Safely through the toughest time for your family

32
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500
It's a measure of entitlement

33
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.966
equity plan

34
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.066
Yeah so you told me this later

35
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.066
The devolved reformers broke the engagement

36
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.000
No problem.

37
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.266
We don't owe each other
