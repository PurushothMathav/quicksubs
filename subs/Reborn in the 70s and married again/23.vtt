00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.066
You dream

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.100
I tell you we are in love

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.100
I got married today

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.400
No one can stop you

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.700
You shameless bitch

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.700
Do you know that you will harm your family by doing this?

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.433
You know what the outside world thinks of us

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.200
Are you worthy of me being this big?

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.066
I didn't do any housework since I was a child

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.200
All the subsidies that are close to you are also given to you.

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.866
Sir, I am worthy of my conscience

12
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.900
Are you worthy of your conscience?

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.100
You just want me to talk to Li Yan

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.666
And let him work for your two sons?

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.833
Don't think about me, bitch.

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.033
Then you already guessed it

17
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.600
You did it on purpose, you said yes, right?

18
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.666
I just don't want to be a stepping stone for others

19
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:46.566
And the jade Ruyi was given to me by my grandmother

20
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.066
I won't give it to anyone.

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.700
You go

22
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.400
You bitch

23
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.633
You dare to let go

24
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.333
Go away is none of your business

25
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.633
I'll kill you.

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.666
Oops would rather

27
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.233
You dog thing that eats inside and out

28
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.866
I think you are crazy

29
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.666
How dare you let someone hit me?

30
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.900
How dare you?

31
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.366
I don't think of you as a daughter

32
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.000
I didn't shave.

33
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.200
My back pain is killing me.

34
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.033
Damn it's dirty

35
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.266
I don't think he's your aunt.

36
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.300
Is your enemy

37
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.033
Maybe it was my hatred in my last life

38
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.766
So I will be tortured by him for the rest of my life

39
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.300
My mom sent me to school when I was little

40
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.933
He wouldn't let go

41
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.666
What books do girls read?

42
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.866
Wait until you grow up

43
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.833
Just want to sell me

44
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.900
Exchange rings for his two sons

45
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.366
Why is he not moving?

46
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.366
Did the bone needle break?

47
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.800
I see if this is not broken

48
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.900
Also crack

49
00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.033
You can't blame me, can you?

50
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.466
You did it to save me

51
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.300
How could I blame you?
