00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
You said they were corrupt.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.533
I don't cooperate with your transformation.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.800
Well, comrade, we're not

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.600
Haha, okay, okay.

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.300
I really don't know.

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm startled.

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.466
I didn't expect such a small place

8
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.866
It can hide dirt to such an extent

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.000
Leading comrade

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.666
You punish them quickly

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.433
Criticism mail pick-up hahaha criticism

12
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.500
mail pick-up hahaha

13
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.066
Are you crazy?

14
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.000
Do you know who he is?

15
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.100
Open your dog eyes and show me clearly

16
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.300
This person in front of you

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.266
Is the captain of our country's defense team

18
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.866
God of War in the Army

19
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.000
It's the eldest young master of the Rong family in Beijing

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.900
Captain surprised you

21
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.333
He didn't delegate the transformation.

22
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.600
It's beginning to set things right.

23
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.933
I'm here to serve as an officer and deputy to Team Rong

24
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.133
Take him back to Beijing

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.500
You're going back?

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.133
So you actually dare to beat up the Rong team's family?

27
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:03.933
Come

28
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.533
Take all these educated youths back for investigation

29
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.000
It's not me

30
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.700
I don't want it, leader

31
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.866
It was all given to me by his regiment in Tangdeng Town

32
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.200
I was deceived

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.500
Hey, I pick up the hair and report him as unworthy.

34
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.866
Didn't you source the medicine cement yourself?

35
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.066
What does it have to do with me?

36
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:19.933
Hey, really

37
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.266
I'm going back to the city soon, it's none of my business

38
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.166
Don't take it away from me

39
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.866
What are you guys looking at?

40
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.300
Go away

41
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.066
How did you announce my identity so quickly?

42
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.766
Captain, I'm not looking

43
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.300
Are there any confidants coming to see you?

44
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.400
I'm worried about your safety.

45
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.800
I didn't want to reveal my identity so soon

46
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.100
Now the whole plan is messed up by you

47
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.566
Well, you go and help me with something

48
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:53.466
Hey captain

49
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:56.100
You said not to mention one, 100 pieces will do.

50
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.833
You should check Ling Yun's background and social connections

51
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.266
I want all his information from birth to the present

52
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.300
next year.

53
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.733
You said he must do this in secret

54
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:08.800
Don't let anyone know

55
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.933
row leader

56
00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:11.133
I promise to complete the task

57
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:11.766
Don't worry.

58
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:14.100
I promise to take out all 18 generations of his ancestors

59
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.466
By the way, you give it for me

60
00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:18.400
My old man said with a word

61
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.800
I'm not his watchdog

62
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:21.400
He kicks it if he wants

63
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.133
Do you want me to go back and bite people?

64
00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.833
Impossible why

65
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.500
Was the old leader also there to protect you?

66
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.466
Throw me out of the team to take it out on someone else

67
00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:30.500
Call it protection?

68
00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:34.066
You ask him to ask me if I'm lonely.

69
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.166
You know all about this.

70
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.200
I know it's hard.

71
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.100
I didn't expect it to be so difficult
