00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.300
What are you so angry about today?

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.300
Who is doing it? Why didn't you come?

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.400
Are you so reluctant to let him go?

4
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.666
This one.

5
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.500
It can be prepared.

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.533
This is what Grandma Xia left for you when she was afraid that you would be hungry.

7
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.966
I'm afraid you will delay the sky

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.666
I knew you didn't miss me that much

9
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.633
Hey you say

10
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.866
If I were to sell antiques

11
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.533
Is someone following me?

12
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.866
Do I want to bump into you by chance?

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.433
No.

14
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.333
At that time, you can pay attention to the surrounding areas.

15
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.766
There's nobody around you.

16
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.166
On the way back and forth, I have arranged for Chenchen

17
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.533
Safe to protect you

18
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.033
Don't worry, this kind of care for me

19
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900
I'm afraid you'll drag me down

20
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.633
You took gun medicine today

21
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.966
I'm going to take a shower

22
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:03.966
What are you doing?

23
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.166
Don't you sleep?

24
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.966
No need to go hunting in the mountains tonight

25
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.266
do not sleep

26
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.866
The image of repairing Marxist philosophy

27
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.500
Then you fix it, I have to sleep.

28
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:46.766
Why are you sleeping in separate beds from tomorrow?

29
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:48.766
OK

30
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:50.533
Ah!

31
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.233
What's wrong? You didn't plan?

32
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.833
Did you get a divorce after returning to the city?

33
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.266
We were tight before

34
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.200
I can't help it, that's why I'm missing a bed.

35
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.900
But we have enough now.

36
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:06.166
You can ask the minister to fight again, but this is the collar.

37
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.866
You really don't have to pretend to be poor to the end

38
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.666
Then sleep in separate beds?

39
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.200
Divide the line

40
00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:20.466
What are you crazy about?

41
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.066
He tosses and tosses

42
00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:26.200
I have to work tomorrow.

43
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.100
I have to sleep

44
00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.200
Heartless little special

45
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.866
If you don't get up again, you will be deducted air points.

46
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.466
Cool like a mint
