00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.566
What's going on?

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.100
It's you again, you nonsense

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.666
What are you doing here in the bullpen?

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.300
Report me to pick up my subject

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.566
come

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.966
How did Bai Yi get hurt?

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.300
What's going on with the moon?

8
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.566
It was Bai Yi who wanted to hit me, so I pushed him

9
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.800
He got hurt

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.666
Did you really do it or did he do it?

11
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.000
He is I am careless

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.466
Blame me for not following my family's instructions

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.800
Sister Li Shu

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
This is a small contradiction between our signatures.

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.000
The brigade should also be in charge

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.433
This little spy is quite protective of me

17
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.500
Sugar-coated cannonballs don't work.

18
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.000
That being the case

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.233
I'll go back first

20
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.133
I'll find someone to send the white clothes to another village later.

21
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.066
Find a doctor

22
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.600
Thank you, Secretary Li

23
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Go home. Go home.

24
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.466
Where did this go?

25
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.966
I beat my aunt today

26
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:08.866
My parents

27
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.633
I'm afraid I won't even give me the living expenses of 2.5 yuan

28
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.766
I'm definitely going to find something to eat

29
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.666
You go ahead.

30
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.233
Where?

31
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:23.033
Come on, I'll take you to one of my secret bases

32
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.500
Hey, is that Secretary Li your date?

33
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.633
He doesn't seem to like me very much.

34
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.733
In fact, you can absolutely ask him to help you get rid of it

35
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.633
The current predicament

36
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.200
Don't have to marry me

37
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.766
I said I have nothing to do with him

38
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.266
Not only in this lifetime

39
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.233
I really wish I had been with people in my past life
