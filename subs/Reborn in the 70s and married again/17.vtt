1
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.533
Cut a box of cookies outside

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.866
A pack of White Rabbit toffee

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.500
Recipient 0 yuan

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.200
Yingziqing has evidence

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.300
Sugar is his

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.233
Okay, I can now prove that I have candy and cookies.

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.633
So how do you prove it's yours?

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then you can only prove that you have candy and cookies.

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.233
You ate yours. It's mine.

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.100
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.933
Comrade Li Yuan has proven

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:26.866
Present evidence quickly

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.366
Tell me what marks are on the jadeite jade.

14
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.500
Xue Hong and Xiaoxia have both seen me receive packages.

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.466
Besides, it's not your turn to be a bad guy talking here

16
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.866
Who claims that the matrix is correct?

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.066
Don executes except for the execution in the same room as you

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:41.866
What else do you eat him for?

19
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.300
Documentary evidence to buy sugar cookies and jadeite

20
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.766
It's not enough to walk in and have proof

21
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.800
Then I have nothing to say

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.433
Just like cookies and sugar

23
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.800
Even the emerald is his, right?

24
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.566
I misunderstood, okay?

25
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.533
Wait a minute Tang Zhixian

26
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.066
You just want to leave?

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.866
I don't care, okay? But I care

28
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.800
I lost a 10 bucks.

29
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.166
I now suspect that what's in your box is stealing from me.

30
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.666
Pardon me?

31
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.900
If you have a $10 bill in your box

32
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.866
That was me!

33
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.866
Ningyuan, what nonsense are you talking about?

34
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.700
This 10 bucks is mine.

35
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.200
Do you have that much money?

36
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.200
My relatives send me things from rural households

37
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.966
Of course I live

38
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:24.766
But

39
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.800
Who stole who?

40
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:28.866
Words are unfounded

41
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.733
Do you have any evidence?

42
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.533
Yeah, do you have any evidence?

43
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:35.100
Or if you ask him for the money, he will promise you?

44
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.866
How dare you rob?

45
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.433
It has my name on it.

46
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.700
This is what I wrote for fear of losing money.

47
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.566
Will he agree if I ask him?
