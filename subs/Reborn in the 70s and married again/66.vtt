1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.166
Tell me, what conditions do you need?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.533
We are all so familiar

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.700
I certainly wouldn't ask for anything too much.

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.933
I just hope to find two trustworthy people to reach out

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.733
Okay

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.000
Help me down the market when I sell

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.100
So you want bodyguards?

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.600
Don't you want to take the college entrance examination?

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.300
how

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.933
Do you still want to participate in self-employed antique scalping?

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.366
My college entrance doesn't affect my business

12
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.200
Besides, it's not a shady thing

13
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.666
I'm short of money after all

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.600
I have to support myself

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.933
I'll take care of you

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.233
You study hard

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.066
Not to mention

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.666
I've already gone through the admission procedures for you.

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.266
Just take a good class

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.366
Really?

21
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.400
Can I really? Of course

22
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.133
But you can if you don't want to go to school

23
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.766
I can support you for the rest of my life

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.400
Shit, of course I'm going

25
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.866
Besides, you will definitely go back to the capital

26
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.200
I don't need you.

27
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.866
Even a real couple

28
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:00.166
Over time, you will eventually have something to eat

29
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.033
It's all up to me to support you

30
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.400
Are you making generalizations?

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.766
There is still marital love in this daily life

32
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.366
The wife who takes care of the children

33
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.633
Respected by lovers

34
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.866
Captain Rong

35
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.033
How can you see what's going on in other people's beds?

36
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.533
What we can see

37
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.000
It's what others want us to see

38
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.266
Besides, I won't spend my whole life

39
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.366
To read a person's concept of being good to themselves

40
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.300
Who did you learn that from?

41
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.366
set by set

42
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.566
Your mother?

43
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.800
Grandma Xia, she kept sheep, she knows a lot

44
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.100
Okay, but I still suggest you

45
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.500
Appreciate this opportunity to learn

46
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Study hard

47
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.166
Talk back

48
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.766
How long will you need this bodyguard?

49
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.400
Just like Chenchen.

50
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.266
I only need it on weekends

51
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.000
He came over to help me set the stage

52
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.866
15 yuan a month

53
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800
Chenchen

54
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.966
Do you know what Chenchen's identity is?

55
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.566
He is the first place in the military competition

56
00:01:58.866 --> 00:01:59.900
Even if it's insurance

57
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.100
What level of leader is the bodyguard for?

58
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.166
And you know what?
