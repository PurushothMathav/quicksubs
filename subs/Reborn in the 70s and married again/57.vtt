00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.666
Mr. Tang, what's the matter?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.266
What did you say while I was away?

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.433
It's not that the old man is afraid that you will be bullied

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.600
aggrieved, that's right

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.100
My wife and I still have a few small items

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.500
The guest came to collect something a few days ago.

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.366
Ah.

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.833
You can also take it and see what you can change.

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.700
Let's go, listen to your teacher

10
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.133
Maybe soon there will be no more

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.666
Brother capitalist tail

12
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.366
Break the fourth uncle's statement

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.066
And indeed, the private sector was liberalized.

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.066
Tang Lao is worthy of being a professor of complexity

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.800
Just by relying on a daily newspaper

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.366
You can see the change and the prosperity of the future

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.500
That was amazing.

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.000
Xiaoyan's return to the city

19
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.500
What are you thinking?

20
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.966
What else can you think?

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.400
Yuanyuan was willing to marry me to help me

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.866
I don't know now.

23
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.266
Is he willing to be with me for the rest of his life?

24
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.766
I'd rather know that he has a lot of ideas

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.700
When I was angry, I heard someone over there say it before

26
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.766
It seems that someone is introducing someone to Xiaoyuan

27
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.700
It seems to be Li Yan, the deputy secretary of the brigade

28
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Could it be that he is the destined sweetheart?

29
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.300
Don't know and don't know

30
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.300
You've been married a few months, right?

31
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.566
What do you do?

32
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.300
Can't you see Xiaoyan's thoughts?

33
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.466
Can't you see it?

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.766
Who knows what he was thinking?

35
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.600
Even if he has a good relationship, it has nothing to do with me

36
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.433
Okay, you don't know what to ask

37
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.833
Then tell me what you think about Xiaoyuan

38
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:34.700
Have an idea

39
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:36.966
What? No idea.

40
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.300
Oh, nothing much.

41
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.700
Got it

42
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.666
Yeah.

43
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.466
But teacher

44
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.933
You don't have to be in such a hurry to sell antiques, do you?

45
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.566
I can pay the tuition if I need money

46
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.100
Nonsense even if you are my student

47
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.633
We can't always accept your help, can we?

48
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.666
You have to stand up too

49
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.666
You can't always rely on men

50
00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:01.266
Not to mention some cynicism

51
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.100
A man who worships high and low

52
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.166
I am, relying on everyone to run dry

53
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.400
Hey

54
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:12.000
Why is he gone?

55
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.400
Brat has a good temper

56
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.900
Teacher, I'll go see what's wrong with him.

57
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.700
Go ahead.

58
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:20.266
If you dare to bully you, tell the teacher

59
00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:22.166
Teacher supports you

60
00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:25.100
What's going on here?

61
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.833
The atmosphere is so weird
