00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.700
The quota for returning to the city to recruit workers is so precious

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.100
You get a share

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.100
How could you do such a thing?

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.733
How can you break the shoe when you go back to the city?

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.266
This whining goes to the bed of the bad guys

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.366
You say cheap or not

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.366
That is.

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.500
If this was left before liberation, it would have gone into a pigsty

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.066
I said we were talking about someone

10
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.800
What are the broken shoes of unmarried men and unmarried women?

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.066
Master Zhang, your daughter

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.333
Xiaohua is also dating the sunspot in the next village

13
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.300
Is it also called broken shoes or cheap?

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.200
You stinky girl, what nonsense are you talking about?

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.600
Frankly, I don't know what Tang Zhenzhen saw

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.866
I was hunting hogweed by the stream.

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.100
Accidentally fell into the river

18
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.600
It was Dr. Rong who saved me

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.566
He brought me back to change my clothes

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.166
Yes, there is a creek next to you.

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.566
This works together too

22
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.033
I have decided to apply for marriage with Dr. Rong

23
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:55.300
I will go to the team tomorrow to introduce Xi Ningyuan

24
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.366
Your consciousness is so low

25
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.266
You're messing with this bullpen sweeper

26
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.400
Together

27
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.800
No one says that.

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.300
Those who are devolved cannot marry

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.166
Since you said it

30
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.833
I want to get the certificate with Dr. Rong immediately.

31
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.700
It's all a misunderstanding.

32
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.166
Everyone go away

33
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.366
In that case, let's all withdraw

34
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.333
Bah shameless little wave

35
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.766
He's done swearing for the rest of his life

36
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.200
Don't worry.

37
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.566
The old party secretary didn't want to make things worse

38
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.466
Make trouble to the informed point and the commune

39
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.800
Not only the red flag of the advanced team will not be available

40
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.966
Collective centimeters will also be deducted

41
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.433
Thanks just now.

42
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.433
But why are you helping me?

43
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.866
Because helping you is also helping myself

44
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.966
This sentence

45
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.366
How to say you stay away from me
