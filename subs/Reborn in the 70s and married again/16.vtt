00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.200
If it weren't for being with you

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.233
This would never happen to him

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.100
Xue Hong Xiaoxia

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.266
You say what's in my box

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.066
Did you miss it this morning?

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.833
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes

7
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.666
Seriously talk about money

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.800
It just disappeared in the morning

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.200
You must have stolen it.

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.000
Right.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.100
The contents of the real box are gone.

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.800
Only 10 bucks left

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.600
Yes, Lin Zhiqing, everyone went to work in the morning

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.400
As long as you are not there

15
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.200
Tang Zhiqing is a decent person

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.300
Yesterday I thought you'd rather have an accident

17
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.200
Tang Zhiqing ran away from his shoes to find someone to help you

18
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.366
Lin Yun, you have no conscience for stealing from others

19
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.800
I'd rather you did you see it with your own eyes?

20
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.333
It is unfounded that I would rather my colleagues secretly write

21
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.100
Do you have any evidence?

22
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.933
He was born twice in a row

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.400
And helped me speak

24
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.200
You bad guy

25
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.566
You must have brought down the cemetery for him to steal

26
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.133
Yeah, it's you, the bad guy

27
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.533
Instructing Lin Zhiqing to steal something

28
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.400
Wait a minute.

29
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.700
This has nothing to do with Dr. Rong

30
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.800
I didn't steal anything at all.

31
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.033
No stealing

32
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.900
I have proof.

33
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.933
Female, if you have any evidence, just show it out.

34
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.200
The brigade will never wrong a good person

35
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:17.000
Tang Zhenzhen, are these the cookies and sugar you mentioned?

36
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.500
My Wanlian Gold Cookies

37
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.666
White Rabbit Toffee

38
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.933
Why is there less sugar?

39
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.300
You also steal

40
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.066
Where is my jade Ruyi?

41
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.266
This was sent to me by my relatives from Gu Shang

42
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.400
Why can't I eat it?

43
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.500
You're lying. My family mailed it to me

44
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.400
I saw it with my own eyes

45
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.133
This is from a real family member

46
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.466
Now I don't know what else Ning Zhiqing has to say

47
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:40.100
Also go to the countryside to support rural construction

48
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.900
It would be nice not to steal from us

49
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.966
Here's my proof.

50
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.400
It has oil pokes borrowed from the strata

51
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.366
You can see what's written on it
