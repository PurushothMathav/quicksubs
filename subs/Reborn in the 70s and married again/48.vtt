00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.300
What if we were a real couple?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.866
Then I will definitely be angry.

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.200
Whenever

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.700
Our little home is your first priority.

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.333
Especially in this kind of scarcity

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.933
With limited resources

7
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.933
You don't want to put your family first

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.000
Show respect to your wife

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.800
What are you doing to get married?

10
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.366
Hey, too many men are making money outside now

11
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.166
Leave the family children to the wife

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.566
They feel that all the money they earn is their own

13
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.533
But in fact, every penny they make

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.466
There is a wife behind it

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.066
Let them not worry about children and families

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.100
Come to the man

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.466
You become a useless thing

18
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.633
It's all up to me

19
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.666
You're way ahead of your time.

20
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.433
But will it affect your ability to find someone later?

21
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.966
Why do you have to find someone?

22
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.066
If you don't find a partner, you will die

23
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.866
You won't die if you don't find a partner

24
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.933
But how can no man live?

25
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.933
Rich women hold up half the sky

26
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.466
Men, don't overestimate yourself

27
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.466
I earn my own money and space

28
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.066
I do the housework myself

29
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.466
I'm sick, I go to the hospital.

30
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.000
What do I need a man for?

31
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.666
I have to serve his family

32
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.500
Wait until you get old

33
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.866
I want to send him shit and pee

34
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.400
Why do you say it like you did before

35
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.200
Found a man

36
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.766
Who have you taken care of for a lifetime?

37
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.366
I've never eaten pork.

38
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.966
I haven't seen a pig run

39
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.766
But you're a man, too.

40
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.833
I'm not like everyone else.

41
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.033
You are not like other women

42
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:26.500
Are you willing to ally with me when I'm down?

43
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.900
Willing to believe me

44
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:28.966
You are the first.

45
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.100
Are they all gay?

46
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.566
Ah, by the way, how many wild boars do you think there are?

47
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.433
bone

48
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
That's why I didn't dare to take them down the mountain

49
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.300
Because it's really a bit of a swagger.

50
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.566
5 heads

51
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.600
That's a lot!

52
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.133
Then we will eat with the shrimp two women for four

53
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.333
I can't finish it either.

54
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.300
Well, I have an idea.

55
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.766
How about making all this pork into bacon?

56
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:53.666
What do you think?

57
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.266
5 heads all made bacon

58
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.066
Afraid of being beaten up

59
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.766
You won't be tired

60
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.666
What is the best solution now?

61
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:03.166
Just sell these pork for money

62
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:05.766
Or exchange for some tickets we need.

63
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:08.566
Actually, I do have a way

64
00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.433
We can inform the village chief about this.

65
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.666
Ask him to send someone to lift the table down

66
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.666
Did our whole village team divide together?

67
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.966
It just so happens that we can still make a favor

68
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:19.466
How could it be right?

69
00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:20.600
That's a good idea.

70
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.700
I know there is a particularly hidden cave in the back mountain

71
00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:25.800
We can sneak one

72
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.700
Make a tamer

73
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.800
Let's go back

74
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.566
We can also keep a little pig there

75
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.333
And then when you need it?

76
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.066
Let's make it a pig roast.

77
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.400
We can do that.

78
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.433
Let's go and have a look before making detailed wine.
