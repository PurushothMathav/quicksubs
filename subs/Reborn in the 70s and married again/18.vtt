00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.066
It turns out that the money really belongs to Ning Zhiqing

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.100
Isn't this a thief shouting to catch a thief?

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.666
The evidence is in someone else's hands

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.133
I have no evidence at all

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.700
He also said that someone else stole from him

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.600
How is that possible?

7
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.966
When did you write your name on my mountain?

8
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.566
How dare you rob?

9
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.866
Here's my money.

10
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:15.766
You give it back to me

11
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.100
Enough Tang Zhiqing has made enough trouble?

12
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.266
Just scare others into committing crimes

13
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.600
Li Yan

14
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.633
Deputy Secretary Li

15
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.533
Maybe I remember wrong.

16
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.033
My 10 bucks.

17
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.566
It should be in Xiaoxia's workbook.

18
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.733
Yes, yes, in my study book

19
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.000
It seems that there is a real 10 yuan.

20
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.233
Before returning the sword to you

21
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.700
And apologize for the misunderstanding just now

22
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.866
I think you are a first offender

23
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.833
The brigade can't remember

24
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.866
Even if it's a misunderstanding

25
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.633
It's always true that he stole organization's desks and chairs, right?

26
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.600
Didn't I say

27
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.266
This is what the old man lent me

28
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.166
If you don't believe me, you can ask.

29
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.333
Also rely on accounting

30
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.366
The warehouse he opened for me in the morning

31
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.733
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

32
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.366
I saw accountant Lai this morning

33
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.066
I went to the primary school warehouse with Ning Yuan

34
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.600
It was really messy just now, I didn't remember it for a while

35
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.066
I see.

36
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.266
I don't think you two are like that either

37
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.466
Secretary Li, you didn't say that just now

38
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Since Tang Zhenzhen framed me

39
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.966
Then he should apologize to me
