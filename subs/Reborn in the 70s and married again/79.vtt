00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.133
Why do you say if that woman can't go to college

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.000
Brother Zhaoban probably won't want him, right?

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.233
You go back first

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.800
I'll handle this.

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.000
Unambitious

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.266
What's the point of not going to college?

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.766
You still have to test to deal with that bitch

8
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.266
Hello

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.100
I have a tender dish that suits your appetite at first glance

10
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.033
Eat me if you can

11
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.666
I won't treat you badly.

12
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.233
How do you want me to eat it?

13
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.666
Do you want to live?

14
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.566
If you can swallow him alive and make him lively

15
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.666
If you can't do it, you can die.

16
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.400
I can send you the information in a while.

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.000
How could you offend Mrs. Rong so ruthlessly?

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.900
Mother-in-law doesn't like her daughter-in-law

19
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.766
Make a rule for him

20
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.366
Wait for my good news.

21
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.166
wife

22
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.466
Can our boss trick the snowman to come back?

23
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.700
Isn't it all for his own good?

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.700
He's obsessed

25
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.700
I really thought I could enter the Rong family

26
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.300
If you wake up early, you can marry a good family

27
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.466
Otherwise, who will want him in the future?

28
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.400
Coincidentally not

29
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.500
Go quickly

30
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:35.733
campus

31
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.466
Dad, why are you here?

32
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.866
How did you know I lived here?

33
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.033
Yes, it's your big brother.

34
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.166
Your brother was injured in the line of duty in the army

35
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:48.800
Seriously injured

36
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.900
Almost dead

37
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.366
Where is my big brother now?

38
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:54.500
It's a comrade from the army

39
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Specially came to see big brother for us one last time

40
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.700
Xiao Yuan, look

41
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.500
I'll walk with you, Xiao Yuan

42
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.600
Ningyuan you

43
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.000
you

44
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:12.000
Director Soup, is this convenient for you to bring him with you?
