1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.966
You stay away from me

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.266
Excuse me.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000
I didn't mean to.

4
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.433
Never mind.

5
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.233
You find me some pants

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.633
OK

7
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.966
I'll go back first.

8
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.066
I'm going to the team tomorrow to open a letter of introduction

9
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.066
Only then can we apply for marriage registration online.

10
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.366
But in my current capacity

11
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.966
You can't just leave the village

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.433
I'm not like you.

13
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.633
In addition to sweeping the ice shed, the renovation below

14
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.800
Work in the ground

15
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.666
I have to go to class.

16
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.666
Let's make a new one first.

17
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.633
How could I have forgotten about this?

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.566
The usual Hong Xiuzhang in the village

19
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.166
And they use it as an excuse.

20
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.500
Trouble with Rong Zhao

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.700
It's even less likely to let him leave the village now

22
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.800
You don't have to post photos to get married now.

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.133
I'll figure out a way to solve this matter tomorrow.

24
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.633
How else could he solve it?

25
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:13.066
I beg the old ruler to find someone to lead it for you

26
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.600
It doesn't have to be weight.

27
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.366
You know quite a bit

28
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.233
No you listen to me uh

29
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.400
Me.

30
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.266
Uncle's son

31
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.866
He just couldn't. That's what he did.

32
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:26.766
Really?

33
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.100
What a coincidence

34
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.200
I'll go back to the execution point first, you can rest early.

35
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.833
Not only did he approach me on purpose

36
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.033
You've even figured out a way to marry me

37
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.366
This young age really doesn't explain

38
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:56.166
But whoever you are

39
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.533
If it is for the background

40
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.866
Sooner or later I'll let you show your feet
