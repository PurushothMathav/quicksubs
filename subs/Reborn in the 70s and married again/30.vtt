1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.266
I have to let him accompany me

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.800
Forget it, haven't you suffered a loss yet?

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.566
More is better than less

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.333
Xiaoxia is right

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.133
I'd rather be protected by bad elements now

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.466
Brother Li An also helped him

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.966
Don't go there and be stopped by him again.

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.500
I can still make him hit me again

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.566
I didn't notice it just now.

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.333
Besides, he doesn't pay tribute for three days now

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.633
This good thing can even make him kill

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.400
Shanggong is really unfair

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.800
Wang Jianhua cannot go to the palace

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.100
0 yuan is not going to the palace

15
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.300
3 cm is not much.

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.100
It's even less now. He just got married.

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.933
Newlyweds are inevitable

18
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.466
But I see that Sister Manhua was just

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.600
Married educated youth

20
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.500
The centimeters are all counted in the village team

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.700
I don't know how Ning Yuan will calculate this time.

22
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.566
Is that right? Then I have to talk to Brother Li Yan.

23
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.966
He married a bad guy.

24
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.366
You still want to share our food?

25
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.300
He dreams

26
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.933
By the way, let Brother Li Yan call the shots for me

27
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.166
Let him pay for my clothes.

28
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500
Hey, do you want to be together?

29
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.466
i

30
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.766
I'm not done yet.

31
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.766
A few more stitches

32
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.700
Xiaoxia, accompany Xuanwu first

33
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.266
Ok then let's go

34
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.433
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.000
This dress is dirty, I'll wrap it up for you.

36
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.866
And my butt.

37
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.100
I will never let him go.

38
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.433
You go first, I'll come over later

39
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.066
So true, you are so kind

40
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.600
Then let's go first. Okay.

41
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.100
Let's go

42
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.433
Ningyuan you bitch

43
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.900
I see you are not dead this time.

44
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.333
Brother Yan, are you going out?

45
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.800
The teacher said that he had something to do with me

46
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.733
Are you okay?

47
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.866
Well we'll take you a few minutes

48
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.500
I want to report something to you

49
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.566
Sit down and talk

50
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.566
Not the one who

51
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:58.200
After he slept with the bad guys, he didn't work hard

52
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.800
You said to distribute grain at the end of this year

53
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.500
We are worried that the centimeter is not enough.

54
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.266
So

55
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.933
Can you row him from the confidant team to the Su team?

56
00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:07.333
From the squad, centimeters are calculated according to protection

57
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.800
Decentralized elements like Rong Zhaonan are the lowest gear

58
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.866
You used to be educated youth

59
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.266
Who cares so much about those who are taken care of by the policy?

60
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.266
He fell for it.

61
00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:16.900
Brother Luo Liyan, look at what he did to my clothes

62
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.933
I want him to pay me

63
00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.666
I can discuss the spring breeze with the village again.

64
00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:21.566
But why didn't you say anything about the clothes?

65
00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:23.366
I couldn't have taken my clothes off then.

66
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:24.400
Let him pay

67
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.300
You see, this is a new dress.

68
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.166
Brother Li Yan

69
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.066
Hide something

70
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:34.833
I would rather write to you

71
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.133
That's hooliganism.

72
00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:39.400
The socialite is married

73
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.766
How dare you write this?

74
00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:42.200
How is that possible?
