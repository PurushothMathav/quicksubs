00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.766
The whisper is over

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.100
Why are you calm now?

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.266
Not afraid of the wind

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.966
I'm not crazy enough yet

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.666
I was thinking I'd be more crazy.

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.700
They can bully you less

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.366
Now you're going back to the capital too, I don't want to go back

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.400
originally delegated

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.866
My family abandoned me

10
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.600
What's the point of me

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.566
It's you

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.966
It's quite protective of me at a critical moment, thank you

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.900
I'm not all for you

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.833
I also want myself not to be taken as a soft persimmon

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.633
Since you're going back

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.300
Then we

17
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.900
Divorce, torture, can't wait

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.766
Why don't you take a shower first?

19
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.466
Rest early.

20
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.333
The earth-shaking changes are coming soon

21
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.366
I have to do something big and small for myself

22
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.900
I always thought he went out in the middle of the night

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.700
It's not fake.

24
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.066
It's almost dawn

25
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.633
What is he doing out there?

26
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.800
Yes, I still think he really protects me during the day.

27
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.433
Now you can't hold me back and follow me

28
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.366
He's tracking so clearly

29
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.966
This little spy is so unprofessional

30
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:54.500
Poor response

31
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Skills are different

32
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:58.600
It's better to take the opportunity to scare him

33
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.900
Teach him a good lesson

34
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.333
From Jincheng

35
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:10.866
You don't deserve it.

36
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.566
I know someone is paying me to buy your life

37
00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.833
I'm going to kill you today

38
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:18.400
Go to hell, boy

39
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.900
Someone is trying to scum

40
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.833
What a coincidence, are they a gang?

41
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.933
So is the captain of the special forces

42
00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:31.800
Also said scum

43
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.066
Be careful how he still reminds me

44
00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.400
Isn't it a gang?

45
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.366
Why don't we take this opportunity to test Xiaote?

46
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.700
Die or die

47
00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:42.266
Although I owed him in a previous life

48
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.533
If you have to

49
00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:45.100
Just treat it as if I returned the favor
