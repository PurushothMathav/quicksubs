00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.500
Brother Tang, you are all ready

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.300
Is that necessary?

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.900
Xiaoyun is still dizzy

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.300
Uncle Ming, you also know that Xiao Ning can defend himself

5
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.200
I don't want to be married tonight

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.600
Knock me down then, don't run away

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.966
Come on, I'll take you out

8
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.766
When will Section Chief Tang give me 1,000 yuan?

9
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.200
I still have to catch the 6:30 train to Ninglan

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.266
What do you mean?

11
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.066
Didn't I say to wait for Xiao Yuan and Section Chief Tang?

12
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.700
Did Yuan Fang go back after receiving the certificate?

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.900
I'm still thinking of waiting to drink that little wild seed's wedding wine

14
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.233
Dream on.

15
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.100
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.766
How many times have I told you?

17
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.866
Xiao Yuan is not my illegitimate daughter

18
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.566
You don't believe me, do you still not believe your mother?

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.033
The old man who killed a thousand knives

20
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.700
He said we needed help.

21
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.300
That little bastard is the child of the head of the Ying family

22
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.266
The child of the fart master

23
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.033
How could it fall into his hands?

24
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.766
What are you going to say?

25
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.166
What do you want?

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.566
That little bastard offended the nobles in the capital

27
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.800
Someone wants his life

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.833
Chief Pang, don't you want to marry Xiao Yuan?

29
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.366
A residual flower is lost, you can play with it.

30
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.000
There is no need to marry

31
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.366
We're all men.

32
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.833
You said you should understand

33
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.500
If I don't lie to you

34
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.200
I also found a good in-law for you.

35
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.133
How could you possibly come with me?

36
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:25.933
Humph

37
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.700
You fool

38
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.966
Dare to run away

39
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:33.666
Ah section chief

40
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.100
I have nothing to do with this crap

41
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:37.533
I don't want the gun

42
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:38.600
I don't want it anymore.

43
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
Hey, does the family have to be neat and tidy?
