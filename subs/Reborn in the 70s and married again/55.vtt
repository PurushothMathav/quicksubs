00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.866
What's up?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.233
Have you been waiting at the village gate for a long time?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.266
Met this colleague who I met a few days ago

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.233
He insisted on sending me back and said he was looking for you.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.800
It's you, Chenchen

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.500
Tell me what's the matter with me

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.833
Well, I'll stay at my house tonight

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.066
We are just right

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:23.233
Catch up, Captain, that's great

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.000
Then I'll go back and pack up first

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500
You talk slowly along the way

12
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.366
Don't worry, you can go to grandma's side first.

13
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.700
She wants Mr. Tang to wait for you

14
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.766
Hey, what captain?

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.266
Your fiancee is coming to see you in two days?

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.366
No, no, no, it's Comrade Qin

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.566
Captain, do you really treat him as an object?

18
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.400
I think this woman is really not an ordinary person

19
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.666
What if he really has a problem?

20
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.800
So I don't call women to court.

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.166
Tell me, a reporter has investigated it clearly

22
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:55.900
Their home

23
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.800
Ningnan is an ordinary citizen family

24
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.300
He was the youngest person in the family.

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.600
There are also two brothers and one sister on it.

26
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.333
One of the eldest brothers was adopted

27
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.466
Currently working in the Shanghai Commercial Health Force

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.000
This second brother is a worker

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This second sister is an actress in a cultural troupe

30
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.333
Is there anything else?

31
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.166
What else is there to say?

32
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.766
That's their family for generations.

33
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.000
They are all servants of your family

34
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.566
After your family moved to Hong Kong?

35
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.500
They divided the estate, thank you

36
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.166
So this jadeite Ruyi is really your home.

37
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.300
Your family just went to Hong Kong.

38
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.500
Not beautiful

39
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.666
Captain, you suspect that there are hostile forces in the employment

40
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.566
Anchor's concealed suit

41
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.500
He's not sure.

42
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.733
However, Lin Yuan and Bai Yi

43
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.966
They all value the jade Ruyi in his hand very much.

44
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:38.833
It's pitiful

45
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.100
Is that so?

46
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.266
You keep staring at everyone in your house

47
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.633
Don't let anything go is to ensure that the task is completed

48
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.266
Someone tried to assassinate me some time ago

49
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.866
You go and find out who ordered it.

50
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.700
What? There's such a thing?

51
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.800
You have to do it in secret.

52
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.300
Oh yeah, I'm in Charing

53
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.133
Let others know about the garden

54
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.500
Including my old man

55
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.700
Guaranteed to complete the task well

56
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.866
There's nothing else. Just go

57
00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:08.533
Hey, captain, won't you tell me to stay for one night?

58
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.766
I don't have enough beds.

59
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.500
What, you want me to sleep on the floor?

60
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.033
Away from quarreling with you in your hometown

61
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200
That's not that's not

62
00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.833
Come here if you want to see flowers

63
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:18.066
Hey, okay.
