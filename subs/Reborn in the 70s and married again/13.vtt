00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.533
Lu Zhiqing, why are you crying?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.500
Didn't I say

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.600
As long as you admit your mistake

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.366
Anyway, I'm willing to give you another chance.

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.366
Tell me about it.

6
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.966
It must be relatives who are afraid

7
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.200
I said I don't have a head

8
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.733
This is what I borrowed from the brigade

9
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.100
Why should I apologize?

10
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.800
Talk to me nicely.

11
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.466
Look at the big green warehouse, it's me who lent it to you.

12
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.366
I don't know.

13
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.866
Not only stealing, but also lying

14
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.733
Li Yuan, you are so shameless

15
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.600
Brother Li Yuan

16
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600
Since the comrades who look at the warehouse have testified

17
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.966
Let's tie him up immediately

18
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.533
Leave it to the old man to deal with it impartially

19
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.566
It's Secretary Li

20
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.966
Theft must not be tolerated

21
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.200
before you

22
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.700
I'll give you one last chance to apologize

23
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.600
Go to the old man

24
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.433
He just gave me the IOU.

25
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.600
Damn girl is tough

26
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.533
Everyone follow me

27
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.300
Arrest this degenerate

28
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.333
What are you doing?

29
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.166
What are you doing?

30
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.366
scram

31
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.900
Ahhhh!

32
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.166
Li Yuan, you are crazy

33
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.566
It's okay if you steal

34
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.066
I'd rather pour dirty water on me

35
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.966
I fought with you

36
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.600
Ah stop

37
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.166
Stop! No fighting

38
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.566
It was him who let go

39
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.166
Why do you want to pull me so that you make mistakes first?

40
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.000
before you

41
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.933
I didn't expect your mind to be so corrupt now

42
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.100
Still unrepentant

43
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.500
I didn't expect Uncle Li to be so young

44
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.700
We don't discriminate.

45
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.666
Brother Li Yan, let me say he doesn't know what's good or bad

46
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.366
We have to have a meeting to fight him

47
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.600
Break up, I'll kill you

48
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:37.533
Be careful
