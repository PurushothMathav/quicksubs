00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.200
Are you here to die?

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.966
Oh, you're still so cruel.

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.200
I really want to kill you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.300
I'm not your captain

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.500
I already retired

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Roll up now

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.166
I've been in the army for years

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.766
How come you still can't make it through three moves?

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.766
I also won the first place in the Global Tournament

10
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.700
express welcome

11
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:19.866
captain

12
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
I used to hear our old leader say that your bones are amazing

13
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.833
Learn martial arts with masters since childhood

14
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.966
Is that right?

15
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:25.866
Don't do this

16
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.533
Stay away from me!

17
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.800
Captain Rossi

18
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.900
Don't be so cold?

19
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.266
I miss you so much!

20
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.833
Don't be a pussy

21
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.366
Say what

22
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.400
If you just went to offend the dog, get out of here

23
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.100
captain

24
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.900
You should know what I'm here for when you see me coming

25
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.366
Sorry we're late.

26
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.000
No matter what you do with me

27
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.466
You have your lives.

28
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.600
I have my days

29
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.033
Don't have anything to do with me

30
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.800
Captain, it's over

31
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.033
Now the whole society has restored order

32
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.366
I'm here to take you back to the capital this time

33
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.300
We all know you've been through a lot over the years

34
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.700
Captain, come back with me

35
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.800
When you were 18

36
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.900
The genius king who makes everyone submit

37
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.466
It was my old man who asked you to come to me

38
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.233
The old leader is now back to work

39
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.700
He has always cared about you

40
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.866
I came to you as soon as I got the order

41
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.833
Really?

42
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.666
I think he's afraid I won't go back and be his pawn

43
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.466
Let you come over and take the lead and sigh about the oral relationship

44
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.266
I swear by the red flag

45
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.333
I'm definitely not a spy

46
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.866
The old leader really cares about you

47
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.100
Red Flag Bless

48
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.100
I am also for the revolution

49
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.800
Go away, I'm not going back

50
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm used to this imaginary life now

51
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:35.866
Not to mention

52
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.333
I have a job.

53
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.833
What? You're not going back?

54
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.933
How can it be difficult to farm?

55
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.733
Are you going to rot in this gutter for the rest of your life?

56
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.600
Be your bullshit village doctor?
