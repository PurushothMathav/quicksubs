That is.

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.566
Don't I want to take the college entrance examination?

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.600
And I didn't study English.

4
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.366
I almost forgot the pinyin.

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.366
The teacher sent me a copy of the previous test paper

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.866
As a gift

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.233

Admitted 273,000 people

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.100
Your level is really grandma

21
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.966
I will definitely not disappoint the teacher.

22
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.066
I will work hard. Okay.

23
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.000
Since you have this determination

24
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.700
I will do my best to teach you well, old man

25
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.866
Thank you teacher

26
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.466
Ok uh

27
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.666
You are tired too

28
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.766
Come back after work tomorrow

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.400
Uh, I'll help you.

30
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.566
Make a review plan

31
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.333
girl

32
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.766
You specially warmed the food for the brat, don't forget?

33
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.166
Thank you.

34
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.100
You brought this newspaper with you

35
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.566
Oops, Chen Gan gave it to him.

36
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.400
Forgot to put it away

37
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.900
Let Rong Zhaonan know that Chen Qian is mentioning his fiancÃ©e

38
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.500
Will it be bad?

39
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:47.300
I read it carefully several times when you answered the question just now.

40
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.200
feel

41
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.900
Huaxia

42
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:55.000
There's going to be a sea change coming soon

43
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.733
What does Mr. Tang say?

44
00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.600
Why are you pretending to be confused?

45
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.666
Not two days ago.

46
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:04.666
Did the senior leaders come down to check your work?

47
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.000
Don't talk nonsense

48
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.266
No wonder I just asked you about your future

49
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.900
Your words are flashing and hiding
