00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.666
how

2
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.133
What happened to Tang Zhiqing last time was true, you know

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.100
Also for the tiger

4
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.633
That is disgusting.

5
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.366
No, I don't.

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.866
I'm afraid too

7
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.766
Tan Zhenzhen told Huaxiong that if he didn't help them

8
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.466
He's going to bully me, beat me, scold me, isolate me

9
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.833
You dick bitch

10
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.066
Ouch, I'm so surfing.

11
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.066
Let go! Why are you hitting me?

12
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.133
Want me to say?

13
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.966
You are black and white.

14
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.766
This little bitch is crying

15
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.333
You're starting to soften your heart, aren't you?

16
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.166
Besides, it's also Ning Yuan and bad elements you mentioned.

17
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.266
Shanshan catches wild boars by traps

18
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.300
If that's the credit, it's also the credit of Shanshan's trap

19
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.766
What does it have to do with them?

20
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.833
Sister Ma Hua

21
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.800
Do you have any business with Lin Xin?

22
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.000
So biased towards him

23
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.900
Are you talking nonsense?

24
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.833
Then I'll give you all the tickets.

25
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.000
Xiao Ming, you

26
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.666
You go tonight too

27
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.066
Lure the remaining wild boars into the trap

28
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.033
I'll give you these tickets.

29
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.833
What are you talking about?

30
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.266
This mountain is so dangerous

31
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.566
Why would I do that?

32
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.933
Do you know the danger?

33
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.466
Just me and my man risking our lives

34
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.266
Lure those wild boars into the trap

35
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.666
You have to do it again

36
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.766
Yes, you are right.

37
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.200
To be fair

38
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.000
Thank you Xiaoxia

39
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.800
you

40
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.800
I'm not going

41
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.266
I didn't see the queue, everyone is waiting

42
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.500
Everyone knows about Tang Zhenzhen and Wang Jianhua

43
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.166
Even educated youth provoke trouble

44
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.900
Also subject to demerit

45
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.700
Now the policy is slowly getting better

46
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.500
I see who dares to bully others casually

47
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.266
Huang Zhiqing

48
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.133
If you don't want this meat, stay

49
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.400
I give it to others

50
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.866
Isn't it just climbing high branches?

51
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.233
What's so great about it?

52
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.000
Wait for the official documents to come down

53
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.100
That playful man will kick you when he returns to the city

54
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.366
See what else you are bothering about

55
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.600
What are you talking about?

56
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.466
I said beautiful, who said I don't want marriage?

57
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:48.133
I'm sorry, the Tang monks used to force me

58
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.466
I didn't mean to.

59
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.966
I understand. It's over.

60
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.733
In the future, be honest

61
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.833
Go to work in line
