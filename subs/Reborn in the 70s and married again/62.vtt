00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.033
Okay, okay, you guys catch up

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.433
I'll take a look at the back

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800
Life is alive

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.700
Should hear

5
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.300
I hit this stool

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.333
I wronged you.

7
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.933
What? How can you do that?

8
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.066
I am a subordinate

9
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.100
Why can't you do it?

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.500
But

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.900
Nan, why don't you open the door for me?

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Brother Nan, you have suffered

13
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.666
But do you need a bed that big?

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.666
Does it matter to you what I use?

15
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.400
Oh, yes.

16
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:02.066
He didn't say he got me a big one with two beds

17
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.366
Brother Nan, have you forgotten me?

18
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.866
I'm your fiancee

19
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.300
Why can't I ask?

20
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.066
Comrade Qin Huangxing

21
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.433
You are forgetful

22
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:12.733
I'm remodeling below

23
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.700
Our engagement was dissolved the following year

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.966
Isn't it big gossip?

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The engagement was broken

26
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.300
Then he's coming

27
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.400
Is it

28
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.866
It was my mother who forced my sister to make an engagement

29
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.100
Not what I meant.

30
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.466
You don't have to make fun of me.

31
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.066
No, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.200
What!

33
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.666
It's not that you don't know that the form at that time was not good

34
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.066
I almost got kicked out of Qing University because of you

35
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.466
Even Mammy Rong thinks it's you who's sorry for our family

36
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.300
Take the initiative to allow me to break off the marriage

37
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.466
Since it's our family, I'm sorry for you.

38
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.600
Wouldn't it be better if our engagement was broken?

39
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.100
No, that's forced.

40
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.366
But

41
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.866
Now you're back to work too

42
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.200
We can also resume our engagement

43
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.666
I will still be your wife

44
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.700
Who is this?

45
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.566
To be so shameless

46
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.233
You said it so confidently

47
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.300
Golden new comrade

48
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.566
Have you read for nothing in the past few years at Qing University?

49
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:06.600
So headstrong

50
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.466
Uncle Song said

51
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.600
He misses you.

52
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.900
I've always wanted you back

53
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.200
Keep the job for you

54
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.866
He said we were a perfect match

55
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.300
Even if I go back to the capital

56
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.066
Also went back with my wife

57
00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:20.800
What's the right match between you and me?

58
00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.000
wife

59
00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:25.433
Where in the country does anyone get a marriage license?

60
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.000
You two don't have a marriage license

61
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.200
It is not a husband recognized by the state

62
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.100
Wife, we really got an injection.

63
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:32.400
I simply said in his account book

64
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.733
I'm his man.

65
00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:34.666
What!

66
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.200
Isn't this a burden?

67
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.366
Yeah, you could say that.

68
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.300
Okay?

69
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:43.766
Uncle Rong said

70
00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:46.400
It's okay to say anything as long as he's willing to divorce you

71
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.233
See if he wants a job in the city or a hukou

72
00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.400
Even the work arrangements of his family

73
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.833
It's not that it can't be solved.

74
00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.666
This old man is quite comprehensive

75
00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:58.166
And I won't dislike you either.

76
00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.133
Even if you were married to that woman

77
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.066
My family also agrees, right?

78
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.033
But I dislike you.
