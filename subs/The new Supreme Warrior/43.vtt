00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.966
Bor Qishui as a teacher

2
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.300
This night is endless

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.666
It really took off.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.466
Uh, yeah.

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.200
He is now worshipping the master

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.866
With his terrifying talent

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.866
I'm afraid it won't take long to break through 6 horses

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.400
Awarded the title of Son

9
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.900
Hey, it's really more annoying than people

10
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.866
We finally passed the test

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.466
Become an outer court disciple

This guy went straight across Inner Mongolia

13
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.333
Became a disciple of the enemy ship

14
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.600
Who allowed people to have such a monstrous talent?

15
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.466
If you have this talent

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.466
You can also worship the master and become an enemy

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.700
The weather today is so enchanting

18
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.466
Ate fairy grass hot pot

19
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.300
Let Thailand's Heavenly Spirit Monument be enchanted

20
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.800
A pot of chicken turned out to be an unprecedented 9 times of inspiration

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.966
Freeland Gate can't stay any longer

22
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.166
Sect Master Zhao, why is this?

23
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.200
Haven't you already apprenticed to Elder Wanmen?

24
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.266
This night is endless

25
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.366
But directly worshiping the overlords of the wolves as teachers

26
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.500
The fifth of all disciples who pass on disciples to enemies

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.466
Destiny of Heaven and Earth

28
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.966
How can a mere 10,000-door elder protect us?

29
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.433
We have a grudge against Ye Wuji for killing corpses

30
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.066
How could he let us go?

31
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.200
That kid is going to pack his bags

32
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.900
Sister Yemei, don't think you can eat emperors because you are talented

33
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.233
Hmph, the age to grow up

34
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.900
Nothing. We'll see.
