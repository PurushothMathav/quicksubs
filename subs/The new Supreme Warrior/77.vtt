00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.366
Try attacking first

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.066
Hahahahaha Night Wuji

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.133
The Five Elements War is on its own

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.166
Attacking brute force is ineffective

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.566
I see

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.566
Ye Wuji, I think you should surrender earlier

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.700
This five-element war can't get out, it's terrifying

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.000
Unaware of life and death

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.600
Since you are willing to suffer

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.233
Then you should be good

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.766
When I see you begging for mercy

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.266
Broken eyes

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.433
open

14
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.566
Who is this broken net?

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.766
And there were different reactions.

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.900
I found the strategy node.

17
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.633
The Five Elements War will be broken for me.

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:49.666
No.

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.566
Impossible this is impossible

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.100
Five Elements Array

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.266
But the top formation handed down from ancient times

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.433
It broke so easily

23
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.566
How did you see the formation node?
