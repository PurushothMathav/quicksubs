00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.966
Master master

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.033
You want to sign up your son

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.500
To rush to the door in front of so many people

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.800
You and Zhao Lingfeng share a nest of snakes and mice

5
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.766
It is the biggest cancer in the future

6
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.466
This shameless villain can't do good at all

7
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.666
Do something straight

8
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.733
Do I deserve to be a straight man?

9
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.100
It's not up to a small character like you to decide

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.300
Good day is a good day for all disciples

11
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.200
It's not your one-word party

12
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:40.566
The Dragon Motherland will never let you steal the imperial master

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.366
That's not something you two dead people should worry about

14
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.700
Ye Wuji must die today

15
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.266
You are happy too early

16
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.866
It's not certain who will kill whom

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.633
Hmph, show your spiritual power to scare me

18
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.066
A mere four products

19
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.233
I am a fifth grade

20
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.766
How dare you fight with me

21
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.466
Oh, Senior Brother Ye is reckless

22
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.166
Yes, although the master is shameless

23
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.900
But he has no cultivation base

24
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.766
Senior Brother Ye, how can a fourth-rank rival him?

25
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.166
I think Senior Brother Ye is finished

26
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.600
What a pity, such a great talent

27
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.100
Hey

28
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.200
So what?

29
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.200
Higher degree

30
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.300
You're just a scumbag

31
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.033
court death
