00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.020
I know it's not easy for you to make money

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.560
But it's too shabby for you to give this for someone's birthday

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.580
It's my favorite red bean milk tea

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.340
This should be the millet porridge you cooked for me yourself, right?

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.520
What can I finally drink on my birthday?

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.340
I want to drink it and boil it for you every day

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.880
Okay, I'm still beautiful in the eyes of the beholder.

8
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.280
By the way, there will be a party in a while. Come with us

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm going to deliver takeout, so I won't participate. Have fun.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.300
It's over, I'll pick you up.

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.120
Let people ride in the battery car you deliver takeout every day

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.500
You can't, so can I?

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.100
Or is my Maybach more suitable for you?

14
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.360
I like to take my Akin's battery car the most. Hmm?

15
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.360
I'm off work. I'm going to accompany him to deliver takeout. As for the cruise party, go and play by yourself

16
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.780
Let's go home

17
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.720
Hey

18
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.720
coach

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.620
You are so haunted

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.140
Let your beloved woman suffer with you in the cold wind

21
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400
Only you can do it

22
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.120
We don't need outsiders to judge whether we are sweet or bitter

23
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.080
Does Zhou Yanjin think that suffering can test love?

24
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.060
Human nature is the least tested

25
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.300
Hey, there's going to be a small move within the Zhou Group.

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.200
You'd better hurry back to your Anle Gang

27
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.960
If you don't go back, you can't go back

28
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.100
Is it really worth giving up all this for a woman?

29
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.020
Before I lose my temper

30
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.300
Better get away
