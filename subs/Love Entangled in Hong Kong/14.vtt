00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.320
Did you hear?

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.040
Marty was picked up by the top gifter

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.320
Right at the entrance of the company

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.120
This is too blatant

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.400
What's the top gifter like?

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.680
Is it a handsome guy who can see Marty?

7
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.240
An old toad

8
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.660
Hahaha

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.880
Maybe live streaming host Marty stole your show

10
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.160
He's so unscrupulous

11
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.360
You should think of a way too

12
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.320
His means

13
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.399
I can't learn

14
00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.600
You didn't look for Zhou Yanjing before to strike up a conversation with him

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.580
Don't talk about yourself so lofty?

16
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.300
Just wait and see

17
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.680
Didn't I tell you to dress sexy?

18
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.166
Ah, I'm telling you, if you want to get things done, don't be squeamish with me

19
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:53.880
Do you hear me?

20
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.866
Then you tell me

21
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.660
Who's in there?

22
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.720
Hey don't ask so much

23
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.133
Remember what I said.

24
00:00:59.133 --> 00:00:59.580
go in

25
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.566
Xu?

26
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.740
I know your concern.

27
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.840
I also want "Financial News" to last a long time, don't I?

28
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.600
I know you planned and made this thing.

29
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.580
You're not reconciled to just leaving it to marty, are you?

30
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.360
Then you have to work hard yourself.

31
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.260
So who is in the box?

32
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.240
They're advertising investors.

33
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.740
Marty's top gifter

34
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.799
Don't worry so much

35
00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.540
OK.

36
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.440
Just listen to me.

37
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.366
Remember

38
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:33.860
Let's go

39
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.560
Don't solve MARTY

40
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.940
Don't say "Financial Times"

41
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.820
I'm going to lose my job sooner or later

42
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.240
Mr. Zhou can help me once

43
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.100
But it is absolutely impossible to help me for the rest of my life

44
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.540
Gone anyway

45
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.866
Then I'll see

46
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.740
Let's communicate who the big shot is
