00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.780
You don't want to say

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.980
Or the top gifter won't let you say

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.300
Don't think how noble you are

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.420
You're just a bitch who gets dumped by others

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.100
I at least have the courage to admit that I have my back on Wang Rongchang

6
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.740
You don't even have the courage to admit it

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.760
He said you were right.

8
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.840
I'm just a lover of Zhong Lianjin

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.900
It's just self-humiliation to say it

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.680
Xiao Xu, I just pulled you back to your live streaming host position.

11
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.140
Think about those things in the past?

12
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.580
What scandal will happen if you go on like this?

13
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.360
Our "Financial News" designation is over

14
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.780
Ah director

15
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.320
I cleaned up the Asian Union after graduating from college

16
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.820
I don't know my character anymore

17
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.680
That's true. That's true.

18
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.940
As for his face

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.140
It's his fault

20
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.880
I also believe that this Yanjing will never be so cruel to him for me

21
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.520
Because I don't know who it is.

22
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.820
If you win, pick it up.

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.620
Yue Luo, why don't you fire him?

24
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.860
I'll call the police

25
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.180
I said that Bo Wei, the heroine of Second Company, has not been willing to harm her colleagues

26
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.640
Since I can't get this result

27
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.100
Then let's all destroy together

28
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.420
Xiao Xu

29
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.040
Do you think about what happened before?

30
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.900
I can't be ashamed because of you at this time.

31
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.820
Say who that person is

32
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.460
See? He's guilty.

33
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.100
Thank you for believing him so much

34
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.400
He took you for fools.

35
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.420
I never gave up my job, even when it was easy.

36
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.820
That Zhou Yanjing

37
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.580
To protect your reputation

38
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.180
I'm doing my best. Okay.

39
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.740
For the reputation of the Allianz Tower

40
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.860
I quit.

41
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.520
And so forth.
