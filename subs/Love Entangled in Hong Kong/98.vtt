00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.020
Xu Yang

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm late.

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.020
Sorry.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.640
You don't have to apologize to me.

5
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.200
But if you come to see me, your fiancee will find out

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.140
He should be jealous again and come to trouble me

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.420
Rong Yizhen and Wang Rongchang have been arrested

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.566
Why is that?

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:19.920
Rong Yizhen and Wang Rongchang cheated our takeaway website and changed it to gambling.

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.280
But they never knew

11
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.760
In fact, I have already expected

12
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.780
Put a bug code on the website and put them in jail

13
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.700
So it's all in your plan

14
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.480
I didn't do all this to clear the way.

15
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.600
In order for us to be better together in the future

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.720
Are you still mad at me after knowing the truth?

17
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.320
Then you don't blame me if I'm with Zhao Lian'an

18
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.980
If you come to me, you won't be afraid of him hitting you.

19
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.600
Your acting is so bad

20
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.000
I already saw it

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.720
But I'm still pissed why didn't you discuss it with me

22
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.680
make up your own mind

23
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.966
Am I so unworthy of your trust?

24
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:55.380
So

25
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.799
No way.

26
00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.000
Did you and Zhao Lian'an fake it?

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.920
People who don't want to be dads still speak so incongruously

28
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.300
I'm going to be a dad

29
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.833
Time Yang

30
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:05.433
Oh, thank you kindly.

31
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:09.020
Willing to keep him without knowing the truth
