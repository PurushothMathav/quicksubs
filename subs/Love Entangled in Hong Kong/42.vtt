00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.020
What does Boss Zhou mean?

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.780
You already knew

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.060
Xu Shiyang is my woman

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.980
Don't be crazy.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.620
When did Boss Zhou worry so much about gains and losses?

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.860
Why are you afraid that I will rob you?

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.700
Then there's nothing to be afraid of

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.100
It's just your behavior today

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.340
What does it represent?

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.340
Xu Shiyang is indeed different from the Yingying Yanyan I met

11
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.220
Beautiful and intelligent

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.820
And a sense of justice

13
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.940
It is really rare for a girl like him to have three views

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.840
I'm talking to you about serious business

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.260
I'm not kidding.

16
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.240
Ah Qing

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.060
I'm serious too

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.740
I like him.

19
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.340
I like it very much.

20
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.740
What's the use of you liking him?

21
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.720
Isn't he just playing with you?

22
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.700
Who said I was just playing around with him?

23
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.920
Akin

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.660
You know very well that you will not get results

25
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.860
What you can't give

26
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.020
I can give what I can't give him, why do you give it?

27
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.540
Don't forget that you are also Di Sun of the ship king

28
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.820
What kind of ship king Di Sun, I'm tired of it long ago

29
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.600
No matter what I have achieved over the years

30
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.780
Can't get rid of the title of Ship King Di Sun

31
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.580
But things are different.

32
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.140
He understands I understand you

33
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.540
You've only met twice

34
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.060
It's enough to see the right person once

35
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.860
Not to mention twice

36
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.640
Gone

37
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.740
We also met twice

38
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.860
Why doesn't he understand me?
