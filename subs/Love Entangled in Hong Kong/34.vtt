00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.380
Are you dead?

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
Why is "Financial News" mine?

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.580
Why do you want to broadcast?

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.820
That Marty

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.120
Don't think that if you bite the top gifter in the back, the whole Arian platform has to revolve around you

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.180
Hey, please go back and tell Mr. Wang

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800
We will not waste his funds.

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.860
There will be other projects arranged for you behind the platform, hahaha.

9
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.940
Wang Rongchang, Sister Jin

10
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.660
Take a good look and see if I can still be on TV here

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.220
Xu Shiyang, this is all thanks to you

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.820
If you hadn't traded completely

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.000
None of this is going to happen.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.180
Why are you a popular live streaming host? I know it's your foil, I don't agree.

15
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.780
Call me a complete sex trade

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.980
Do you dare to tell them

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.460
Who took you away yesterday?

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.100
You put

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.060
Let go of me! Can't you see?

20
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
This person is the bodyguard sent by the boss behind Xu Chi

21
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.940
Not at all a security guard in the Alps

22
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.460
Shut up and talk nonsense, I'll cripple you

23
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.360
This is where I work.

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.620
Let him go

25
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.660
You obviously rely on men to rise

26
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.020
Bing Qing Yujie is now installed.

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.820
That's a good trick

28
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.640
Stop talking nonsense here

29
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.500
Then do you dare to tell everyone

30
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.420
My face is cut into needles

31
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.380
Does it have anything to do with you?
