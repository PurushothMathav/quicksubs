Thank you

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.260
Zhao Lian'an, why are you here?

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.900
Why don't you call me Mr. Zhao?

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.800
Are you Akin's friend?

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.600
Call you Zhao Lian'an more kindly

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.400
Miss Xu still has a sweet mouth

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.500

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.400
Miss Xu will scrutinize the poison oath

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.800
Then you should also know

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.000
Zhou's Group has never been the only one to inherit Zhou Yanjing

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.380
Mr. Zhou will not accept you either

13
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.660
Are you trying to persuade Akin to go back?

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.820
You know

15
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.060
You have a future with Akin

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.560
I like you.

17
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.300
I can name you Doorshade openly

18
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.760
Zhao Gongzi, I want to tell you that I only love Zhou Yanjing in my life

19
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.260
Don't worry about other ideas.

20
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.120
Even if he gives me a lifetime

21
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.460
I love you and you love him too

22
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.660
Even if he gives you a lifetime

23
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.900
I love him too.

24
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.720
Fine

25
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.160
Wang Rongchang has returned to Harbor City

26
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.280
He will definitely take revenge on you for what happened before

27
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.820
You two take care of yourself

28
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.720
Who are you?

29
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.220
Brothers

30
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.360
Grandpa, let me take a look

31
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.700
Open your eyes.
