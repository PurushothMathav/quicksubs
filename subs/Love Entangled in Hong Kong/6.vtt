00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.566
Who are you allowed to give them the money?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.360
Why should I pay back the money you owe?

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.220
I'm your sister, not your ATM

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.980
If you don't pay me back today

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.500
We both die together

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.720
Die yourself

7
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.080
You rotten gambler

8
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.580
If you don't pay me back

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.940
I'm going to spread rumors

10
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.540
Say you're a jerk who follows everyone for money

11
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.500
Keep your mouth clean

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.520
When your reputation is bad, even if you go to the police, the police won't believe it

13
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.300
I'll sell you to the red light district

14
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.799
It can be reduced to a tool for me to make money

15
00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:32.580
Let go of me!

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.760
This Man

17
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.600
I can tell by the look in your eyes that he is interested in you

18
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.880
Listen to your brother

19
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.340
Take him and have the glory and wealth you can't enjoy

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.320
Mr. Zhou

21
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.980
Could you please do me a favor?

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.300
How to help

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.820
My brother, what he owes is illegal gambling

24
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.200
Could you please come forward and help me solve it?

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.133
These people

26
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.040
I already helped you once.

27
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.780
This is the second time you've begged me

28
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.266
Miss Xu

29
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:22.966
world

30
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.420
No free lunch
