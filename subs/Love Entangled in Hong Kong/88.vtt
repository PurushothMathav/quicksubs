00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.720
Although I don't have much savings

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.580
But all my money can be used to support his project

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.280
Okay, one wants to start a business

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.600
One is willing to pay

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.420
I just don't know how much savings Miss Xu has made as a streamer?

6
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.760
I've sent a lot of mail home over the years.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.220
There's still 1 million in Cary

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.040
Isn't it easy?

9
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.500
So little money in business

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.180
The money for the facade is not enough for a few days.

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.700
The business I want to do doesn't need to be south of the board

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.980
The money is enough to get started

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.580
Develop APP

14
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.540
Integrate takeout and catering

15
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.420
Building a healthy platform for young people

16
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.060
When did the small business of takeout and catering become part of our Zhou Group's actress, Miss Xu?

17
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.140
You lowered his horizons.

18
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.160
The takeaway market in Harbor City has great potential

19
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.540
As long as the data is enough, I can make an online platform by myself

20
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.480
Times are different.

21
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.160
The Zhou Group needs innovation

22
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.540
I want to be my own king

23
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.500
Hum entrepreneurship

24
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.860
It's up to you to teach me

25
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.040
Grandpa, didn't you also rely on grandma's savings to come up step by step?

26
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.000
Even now

27
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.580
You also often look at grandma in a daze

28
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.740
And me now

29
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.980
What's the difference?

30
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.760
Ok anyway

31
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.220
This kind of small business that can't be sold on the table

32
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.940
Resolute opposition

33
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.460
Miss and the money went to waste

34
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.260
Don't regret it

35
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560
Yanyan, I believe in Ajin

36
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.700
I have no regrets

37
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.600
This girl took out money to support Ah Jin's entrepreneurship

38
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.840
Compared to those rich ladies

39
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.580
Is worth trusting

40
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.240
Dad, for the sake of your years of hard work for the Zhou Group

41
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.580
I'll give you a retirement payment today

42
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.180
Thanks grandpa

43
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.340
Thanks grandpa
