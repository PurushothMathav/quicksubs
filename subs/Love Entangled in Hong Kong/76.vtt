00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.840
Stop

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.700
Xu Yao told you to put Xu's medicine

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.840
Or I'll make your life worse than death.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.060
It's none of my business.

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.760
It's all him, it's all his orders

6
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.200
Close your eyes, are you trying to protect Xu? You've been following me, right?

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.560
How many years do you need for murder?

8
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.900
I've already warned you not to complain about closing your eyes

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.040
You are going too far.

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.800
He's probably just a little live streaming host

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.720
Why can I get your love so easily?

12
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.200
I am the eldest lady of the Rong family

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.500
I can't compare to him

14
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.940
Why go

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.740
You had multiple miscarriages while studying in the UK

16
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.480
There is still a face to compare with him

17
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.500
I can't have you even if I'm single for the rest of my life

18
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.360
You know, so what?

19
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.540
I'm also cleaner than the fact that I sold myself

20
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.800
What are you doing?

21
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.960
Do it now!

22
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.720
The things in our Rong family can get you 10 million even if you are in prison

23
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.100
I will never pay it back

24
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.460
Hey don't come

25
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.160
I'll take a piece of Confucius to chase the stars, don't just go, go away

26
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.680
He's gone crazy, go away

27
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.120
Murder requires jail time

28
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.000
You just let him go

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
I'll give you as much as you want.
