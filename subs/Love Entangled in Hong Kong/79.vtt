1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.580
Before I met you

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.960
I have never believed in love

3
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.500
But you are the exception

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.140
My history has been disrupted by you

5
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.740
You ignore my confession to you

6
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.380
Treat my feelings like grass

7
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.120
And this really frustrated me.

8
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.020
confession

9
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.480
When did you confess to me?

10
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.840
I'm not impressed at all

11
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.340
We drank together that day

12
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.860
In bed I ask you

13
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.060
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

14
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.780
Have you forgotten?

15
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.600
drink

16
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.420
I thought he was dreaming

17
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.260
I don't know if you really confessed to me

18
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.880
How ridiculous I am!

19
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.980
I like you so much

20
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.940
It's sunset, do you think I'm stupid?

21
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.660
Not stupid not stupid

22
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.920
How can you be stupid?

23
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.220
The stupid one is me

24
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.180
You don't pretend to be affectionate

25
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.240
In fact, I actually liked you a long time ago

26
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.620
I was at that time

27
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.800
This Qin sister is a French designer

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.220
Specially designed

29
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.240
For wedding photos, we will take them when Yanjing is free.

30
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.060
Jing is usually very busy

31
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.980
You are a sensible person and should be able to understand her.

32
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.560
Hey, what are you doing?

33
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.420
I'm not going to talk to him about wedding photos

34
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.140
Grandpa, please understand my grandpa too.

35
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.380
Don't be angry.

36
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.340
Don't hurt the peace between you and your grandson because of me.

37
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.100
Don't step in front of my grandfather

38
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.500
Even if I talk nonsense about your pregnancy and abortion

39
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.880
Grandpa will know in the future

40
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.340
Instead of thunderstorms in the future

41
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000
Why don't I pay you off first?

42
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.800
Really?

43
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.100
He listened to him.

44
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.900
It's all true.
