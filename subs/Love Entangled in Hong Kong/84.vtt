00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.160
Come on.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.600
Have you been having trouble finding a job recently?

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.960
How did you go to deliver takeout?

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.120
Don't you despise delivery people?

5
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.500
No, definitely not.

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.700
I'm worried about you dear

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.500
You also want to drive me to a corner and go home and beg him, I won't obey

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.360
I will prove to him that he can do well in any industry he wants to do

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.660
I can also give you happiness

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.420
Yo Yo Yo

11
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.000
Look at us, Xu

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.240
But I forgot my birthday for our show

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.100
But fortunately, someone important helped you

14
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.300
Of course, flowers have to be accompanied by wine

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.820
Happy Birthday

16
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.860
Why haven't I seen a kidney transfusion for a few days?

17
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.500
No, it would be a surprise. Thank you, Mr. Zhao

18
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.200
Old acquaintances

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.280
Just call me Alian

20
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.040
By the way, I packed the mailing slip.

21
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.340
Let's play together in a while

22
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.920
Xiao Xu, Mr. Zhao is now a noble person in our company

23
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.020
You can't ignore the company just because you are in a relationship with Zhou Shao

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.260
Won't you accompany him like you asked me to accompany Wang Runchang? No, who?

25
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.420
Yanjin Ajin

26
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.900
What gift did Miss Xu bring for her birthday today?

27
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.580
Well, forget it.

28
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.540
I know it's not easy for you to make money.

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.260
But it's too good for you to give this for someone's birthday. Forget it.
