1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.180
Not important.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.820
Zhou Jingjing, your punch almost fooled me

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.820
You actually fought those outlaws for Xu Shiya

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.040
You don't want to die

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.140
Don't forget.

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.060
Financial Shi Wen is Zhu's Group in the middle

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.660
I'm responsible for something wrong with the show

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.140
I originally thought that after this

9
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.620
Sister Xu Xia can change her mind about me

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.620
It seems to be my wishful thinking

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.620
Never mind.

12
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.300
It's not appropriate for me to simply lie down

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.340
I'm not eating this dog food

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.620
Did you really do so much for me?

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.700
I'm for the Zhou Group

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.220
Remove some rubbish from the market

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.640
Not just for you

18
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.100
Do you really think

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.940
Own head

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.700
I can't let him worry about me

21
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.100
This rebuttal has not been fully settled

22
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.520
I was alone.

23
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.140
Those are all relationships today

24
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.300
Have a good rest.

25
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.020
Do not come out

26
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.420
Although go to work

27
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.940
Me.

28
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.380
The one you want

29
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.880
Who is it? How dare you come to the company?

30
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.740
Ah!

31
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.500
See for yourself?

32
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.400
What's the Internet saying about you now?

33
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.320
Now they say you are a fishing girl

34
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.600
Using capital to manipulate the market

35
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.880
Those ghosts

36
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.160
I wish I could eat you

37
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.760
You should go home now.

38
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.520
Don't come to the company to embarrass yourself

39
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.820
It's not like this, I can clarify it.
