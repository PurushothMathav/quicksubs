00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.940
What are you going to do if something so big happens?

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.860
Help me stop the right to use Wang Rongchang's horse head

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.340
Your loss

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.020
I'll make it up to you.

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.700
Zhou Shao

6
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.500
Before, you and Wang Rongchang were complementary interventions

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.060
Why do you suddenly want to clean him up this time?

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.820
Could it be because of that Xu Shiyang?

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.260
Just say help or not

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.600
help

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.460
But I don't want compensation.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.980
Just help me when I have something to ask you later

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.660
It's not that our Zhao family can't afford tens of millions.

14
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.180
But the more curious I am

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.099
Your relationship with Xu Shiyang?

16
00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.660
eventful

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.660
Gone

18
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.980
I seem to be making an exception a lot lately

19
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.140
Xu Shiyang

20
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.140
Is it really because of you?

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
Something big happened

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.966
Financial news

23
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.520
It's half an hour to go LIVE and Marty hasn't arrived yet

24
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.620
Did Wang Tai know about his relationship with Wang Rongchang?

25
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.000
Take care of him

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.920
Don't talk nonsense

27
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.220
I'll give a call to find out.

28
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.866
What about people?

29
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:24.566
Ah, Marty, the show is going LIVE soon

30
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.220
Where is she?

31
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.820
It's too late to go to Xiaoxu, you go first?

32
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.600
It's too late.

33
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.460
Yesterday, Mrs. Wang came to my door, and I knew something was wrong.

34
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.940
Even if she comes to this show in the future, it won't be hers.

35
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.820
Ah, so you will be here in the future of this show, okay?

36
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.300
Is this a blessing in disguise?
