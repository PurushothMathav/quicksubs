00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.820
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.820
How did you find it?

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.820
I was just there when your car rushed out of the villa

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.940
Then why didn't you save him?

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.100
He was so dangerous

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.980
Asked me to risk my life to save him

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.620
And isn't he fine now?

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.780
He is fine now

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
Just be fine

10
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.260
Okay.

11
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.300
I know you approached him for resources

12
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.460
But you won't fall in love with him now

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.300
Do you think I just fell in love with him now?

14
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.820
Me

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.580
I fell in love with him ten years ago

16
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.460
This is him 10 years ago.

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.700
He was ten years ago

18
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.020
Save me from the fire

19
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.900
Quit my job and go to other schools

20
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.020
His ugly duckling

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060
Fall in love with him every day

22
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.380
The ugly duckling falls in love with the big bad wolf

23
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.740
Does he know?

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.340
How could he possibly know?

25
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.820
He just treats me as an optional toy hum

26
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620
I can't make it either.

27
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.020
I had to protect myself.

28
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.780
Yeah, the rescue money.

29
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.660
Your last dignity

30
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.940
Didn't get his heart

31
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.740
Instead, it stole my heart

32
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.900
Everything is in the room and no one is there
