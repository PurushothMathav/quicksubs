00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.480
Grandpa grandpa

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.440
How about your eyes?

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.100
Eyes, how is he now?

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.920
Hey

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.080
Life is saved

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.440
Severe leg injury

7
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.500
I can't do any physical work for a short time

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.320
Hey

9
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.220
It's all my fault

10
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.000
Gave him his chance

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.100
No, no.

12
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.360
Grandpa blames me

13
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.360
I shouldn't have been selfish and kept him by my side

14
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.860
But now it's all because of me

15
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.700
In order to solve the ruble incident, Akin

16
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.560
He fights short sellers.

17
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.360
Offended a lot of people

18
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.480
Now the Zhou Group is fighting infighting

19
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.980
There are a lot of people who want him to die outside and never come back

20
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.000
These things have nothing to do with you

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.620
You don't have to blame yourself

22
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.940
You're a good boy.

23
00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.040
I heard that Zhao Lian'an wants to marry you if you are willing to marry into the whole Wang family

24
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.900
I will recognize you as my goddaughter

25
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.100
How about leaving Yanjing?

26
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.340
Give him a way out

27
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.220
Count me an old man please

28
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.940
Even if I'm haggard

29
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.900
I won't break up with him

30
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.360
They cooperate quite tacitly.

31
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.740
A man who wants to cripple people, do you want a team?

32
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.540
Is it possible that in your eyes, I am just an incompetent puppet of the group that has been tested in the exam?

33
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.220
I'm going my own way

34
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.040
Go your own way

35
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.360
Want to start a business?

36
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.600
Do you have any money?

37
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.640
You left the Zhou Group, you are nothing

38
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.560
No bank loan to your grandfather

39
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.800
I have money, although I don't have much savings.

40
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.500
But I can put all my savings behind his startup
