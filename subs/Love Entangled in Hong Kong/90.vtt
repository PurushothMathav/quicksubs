00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.700
Ah Jian, our software will be launched soon. I'm so nervous.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.960
You have to trust the software I designed.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.360
Don't worry, as long as the data is ok.

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.020
accurate customer engagement

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.820
Results in an hour

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.640
I didn't expect you to be able to architect and program

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.260
You are amazing

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960
You see, someone has already registered.

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.260
And the number of views skyrocketed.

10
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.680
Ah Jin, you said that they don't all come from recharging and registering red envelopes, right?

11
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.280
What happens once we run out of money?

12
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.520
Our cost of customer acquisition is the lowest in the market

13
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.640
As long as customers can browse

14
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.920
The data has been good.

15
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.020
Investors will contact me soon.

16
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.660
You see a lot has appeared

17
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.320
Right

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.300
Do you want to invest in me?

19
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.940
Oh, really?

20
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.940
Ok, I'll be right there.

21
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.880
Do you understand the background of the other party clearly?

22
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.300
I don't worry if you go alone, I'll go with you.

23
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.800
Boss Zhou, we are not a big group

24
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.420
You just sit here and listen to the data

25
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.860
Give me time

26
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.960
Pay attention to safety

27
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.700
Long time no see Xu Da live streaming host

28
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.700
Don't come here

29
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.540
My date is coming soon

30
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.060
Are you making an appointment with Mr. Fei?

31
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.020
That's right, I'm Mr. Wei

32
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.640
What do you dare to do to me?

33
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.180
Aren't you afraid that Zhou Yanjing will make you disappear completely?

34
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.400
Stop pretending to be awesome with me

35
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.300
Zhou Yanjing is just a keyboarder now, delivering takeout to me as a younger brother, and I have to see if I agree or not

36
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.540
As for you, you'd better serve me first

37
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.340
I'll come back to you when I'm done with the boss.
