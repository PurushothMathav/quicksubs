00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.500
Mr. Xia, why?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.466
That medicine glass has been working hard

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.700
Although it has been rising now

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.033
But it's going to plummet soon.

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.266
If you buy it now, you will pay.

6
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.666
So stop trading now

7
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.500
Already bought it?

8
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.166
Wouldn't that be a loss?

9
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.333
Don't worry, low salary.

10
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.366
pull platform price

11
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.300
Trouble Harvesting

12
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.633
This is the consistent way of the bookmaker

13
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.066
Instead of us being leeks for the dealer to harvest

14
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.400
It is better to buy one and work hard to be the owner by yourself

15
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:25.966
Zhuang

16
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.333
The essence of the operation of stocks is the same as that of commodities

17
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.766
The bottom line of supply and demand

18
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.333
The price of long-term stocks

19
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.800
Is determined by the company's performance

20
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.900
But the price of short-term stocks

21
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.833
This is the manifestation of supply and demand

22
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.666
We are in urgent need of money now

23
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.400
So if you want to make money from the stock market

24
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.033
You have to start with supply and demand

25
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.666
As long as we get everyone to buy ducks

26
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.633
Glass the dog

27
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.066
We'll sell it all when he goes up

28
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.533
We can make a lot of money

29
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.366
This is Zuzhuang

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.966
But

31
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.500
How can we get investors to snap up

32
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.800
Do you want to take glass?

33
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.500
Ouch, that's bad luck.

34
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.400
How can I meet you everywhere?

35
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.233
You bumpkins

36
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.466
Do you know how stocks work?

37
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.066
I don't know how to play stocks yet, are you?

38
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.600
Ah so confident

39
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.500
OK, take a gamble.

40
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.033
Bet on who has the highest return on investment

41
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.266
How do you gamble?

42
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.600
I don't lack either

43
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.466
Uh, bet on women

44
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.966
If you lose

45
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.400
She stayed with me all night
