00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.200
Who is in charge here?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.100
I'm in charge, wait a minute.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.300
Isn't that Liu Da from National TV?

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.800
He is now the most popular in the country

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.300
At least a hot reporter

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.733
What did you tell him?

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.266
I have my ways.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.366
In his previous life, he and Liu Xing were the best help

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.566
It's him now

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.966
I am in a hurry to find material for the Spring Festival documentary

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.100
Just right

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.300
You can use this Spring Festival gift box sale as a material.

13
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.366
Ask him to help with advertising by the way

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.766
Hello reporter Liu

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.266
Welcome to our sales site

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.466
This is what you said.

17
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.466
Topics that are in line with the current Chinese New Year hotspots

18
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.633
It's really suitable for this hot scene

19
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.500
This gift box

20
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.666
Give it to me first, or the reporter can go back and taste the heart.

21
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.466
Give me a box like this.

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.533
Do you want me to help you promote and advertise?

23
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.066
Nothing can escape Liu's inheritance

24
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.700
Advertisements I can make for you for free

25
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.133
It is also paid for the advertising fee of the TV station

26
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.500
Don't worry, the advertising fee and the production fee.

27
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.433
I will not mistreat Liu's inheritance for a penny

28
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.266
By the way, I have a few more advertising words here.

29
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.700
Why make up

30
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.300
Please make it then.

31
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.633
The Golden Age of Television

32
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.766
No gifts for Chinese New Year this year

33
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.600
Is this word going to be sung?

34
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.166
Yeah, you gotta sing like that

35
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:16.500
No gifts for Chinese New Year this year, no gifts, no gifts

36
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.466
Receive gifts, only receive cool gift boxes.

37
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.700
If you receive the gift box, you will receive the gift box.

38
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.900
Are you sure you want to air such a funny ad?

39
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:28.066
Of course it's funny enough to spread, right?

40
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.466
When someone comes to check the pile, please.

41
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.766
A reporter has to come and interview it. Okay?

42
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.066
Then I'll go back and arrange it.

43
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.500
Then it's hard for reporter Liu

44
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.500
What about the car, is it?

45
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.366
Must be.

46
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.566
Who is that girl?

47
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.033
Chatting and laughing with him

48
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.466
You won't have any money.

49
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:46.000
Do something sorry for Xiaoyan

50
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.200
What about men?

51
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.733
Money becomes bad

52
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.166
What are you thinking?

53
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.766
That reporter Liu Da was hired by me to advertise for us

54
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:55.266
Advertise

55
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.700
We have all the gift boxes now.

56
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.866
It's selling so well.

57
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.333
What else do you need to advertise?

58
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.500
You don't understand

59
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.700
It's not a hot scene at all

60
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:04.633
One start at most

61
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.366
This is just the beginning.
