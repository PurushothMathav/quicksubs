00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.700
How dare you push me!

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.433
I see you, don't even think about doing this job

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.633
What am I doing?

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.533
The factory has been sold out.

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.866
The big boss is on his way

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.666
What kind of decency is it to be noisy and noisy?

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.566
acting manager

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.800
Jiang Yan seduces men

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.133
He just hit me

10
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.466
Now this rotten guy should be fired

11
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.800
Lest the big boss be more unhappy

12
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.200
These are his

13
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.600
Who doesn't know that Platinum is more inappropriate than Zhao Yun?

14
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.800
Yeah, especially white crystals.

15
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.233
How many times do you want to dip in soy sauce?

16
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.233
He won't let you get caught paralyzed now

17
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.900
Manager Bai, I didn't seduce men

18
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.466
He was the one who scolded my man first

19
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500
Just pushed him

20
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.800
What's wrong with calling me your man?

21
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.766
A waste like Yiqiu has no regrets

22
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.200
Shouldn't I scold him?

23
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.733
Manager Bai, you said a man like Yiqiu

24
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.933
Should I scold him?

25
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:48.900
Lili is right

26
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.233
Yiqiu, this wimp

27
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.800
Don't scold him

28
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.133
He wants to appear in front of me

29
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.600
What if I slap him twice?

30
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600
As a man

31
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.200
Why don't you love your beautiful wife?

32
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.266
Manager Bai

33
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.766
How do you want to deal with this matter?

34
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.633
No matter what the reason is

35
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.333
It's wrong for you to hit people

36
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.533
What conflict do you have? Come to the office to find me?

37
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.833
Why do you hit people?
