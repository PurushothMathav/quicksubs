00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.566
Can you really pretend to come and see?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.700
This loser says which one he wants to applaud

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.066
Which drum can clap?

4
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.066
What!

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.933
You can applaud whoever you want.

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.466
I've been frying drums for years and I can't say that

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.166
You look like a turtle

8
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.100
What big tail wolf defense

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.200
Is this your friend?

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.400
Don't get me wrong.

11
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.100
I don't have the habit of treating trash as friends

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.666
Who are you calling trash?

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.300
Why is summer rain cool?

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.933
You still don't accept

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.666
Is he a piece of crap?

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.066
Since he is trash

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.333
Who is the person who fled in embarrassment in the office?

18
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.166
Who is the person begging for mercy at the point of sales?

19
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.700
Okay, now let's see who the hell is trash

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:43.866
everyone

21
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:47.300
I've been saying since I came in that Sauce Technology will definitely grow

22
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.200
And there have been 10 assassins

23
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.600
And he is a medicine talisman glass

24
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.366
It's already 5 cents

25
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.766
Shrinking by more than 10 times

26
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.300
He also said that he wanted the medicine talisman glass to rise

27
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.866
He can go up

28
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.500
Everyone says who is the trash

29
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.866
Tell me about it.

30
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.300
You can buy a stock that has fallen 10 times

31
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.333
This ordinary waste can't compare

32
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.100
If you want a pair of glass, let him fix it.

33
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.266
Who do you think you are?

34
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.400
Treat yourself as a stock god

35
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.166
Hey, you're still smart.

36
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.366
That's right, this era

37
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.000
I am the stock god
