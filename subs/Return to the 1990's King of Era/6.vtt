00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.200
What 1 million

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.633
Got 1 million in a few hours

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.566
Yes!

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:10.100
I didn't expect this liar to die and become a living horse doctor

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.800
It really saved our growth

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.266
Not bad, you lived up to my trust in you.

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.600
Sister Shuang, I will never let you down again in this life

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.100
XiaoShuang

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.200
Hey, Uncle Sun

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.900
What wind brought you here?

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.400
Xiaoshuang heard that your food factory's capital chain is broken.

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.500
I've known your father for a long time

13
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.600
I'm ready to acquire your company outright

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.933
Don't worry, you can continue to be your general manager.

15
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.500
It's just that the boss is replaced by me.

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.133
How about Uncle Sun?

17
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.166
Thank you for your kindness.

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.966
But we've raised all the money.

19
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.233
What did you raise?

20
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.833
Xiao Zhou, you'll know when you take a look.

21
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.166
Borrowing money with bonds within a business tells you

22
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.200
Xiao Shuang, you are a business genius

23
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:03.966
Uncle Sun?

24
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.600
I didn't come up with this method.

25
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.100
It's a poverty that my best friend's lover came up with

26
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.600
The name Yiqiu sounds familiar.

27
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.300
autumn

28
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.966
This is Sun Hongyun, the chairperson of Dingsheng Group

29
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.966
Can you say?

30
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.500
All the groups in Jiangnan

31
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.766
It's all under his control

32
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.000
It just so happens to be my father's friend

33
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.300
This Sun Hongyun's Dingsheng International is a listed company

34
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.600
Things 1 billion

35
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.366
One of his executives at the time

36
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.700
Managing camels with money

37
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.200
Fleeing with a huge loan

38
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.666
Sun Hongyun's business empire also went bankrupt

39
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.266
I ended up in jail.

40
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.466
Lifetime included.

41
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.700
Hello Mr. Sun

42
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.100
Oh.

43
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.366
I remember now.

44
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.666
You are the one who paid your wife hundreds of thousands of medical bills

45
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:50.866
A gambler's ball to gamble
