00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.500
Pardon me?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.100
I said let's get a divorce.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.366
Not why

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.566
I didn't gamble

5
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.933
Did nothing illegal

6
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.733
Aren't we getting better?

7
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.200
Just because it's so good

8
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.666
So I want to divorce you.

9
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.200
I used to be so fucked up

10
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.866
My family is so poor, you didn't divorce me

11
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.266
Now we are rich

12
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.000
You want to divorce me instead

13
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.766
I used to fantasize

14
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.100
You can get away from being a gambler.

15
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.666
Become the backbone of the family

16
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.933
Let me and Xiaorou have a good life

17
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.566
Now you did

18
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.233
No longer the gambler that everyone hated before

19
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.500
Become the city's most famous entrepreneur

20
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.300
But what

21
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.466
But is that wrong?

22
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.700
It's not your fault.

23
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.200
It's me now I'm not worthy of you

24
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.366
You are now a well-known entrepreneur in the city

25
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.500
But what am I

26
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.600
I am a textile factory worker

27
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.000
What qualifications do I have to be with you, Xiaoyan?

28
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.566
What are you thinking about?

29
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.933
No matter what you are

30
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.166
You are the most suitable person by my side

31
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.200
Do you really think I'm not? Of course

32
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.866
But I think

33
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.900
Yu Chuang is the most suitable person for you, right?
