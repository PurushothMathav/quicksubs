1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.500
Maybe I can be a CEO

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.866
Damn girl go

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:04.566
It seems

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.466
You really don't know the situation in my factory.

5
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.766
Sell young age 15 days to earn 1.20 million

6
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.266
Better to buy 5 million in the lottery

7
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.666
Of course I know what's going on in your factory.

8
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.400
Nowadays, the market economy is developing rapidly

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.633
Many officials went to sea to do business

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.666
This little snack

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.900
Children will become the first choice for many people to start a business in the future

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.766
The number of people working in this industry has increased

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.300
Cause a backlog of your goods.

14
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.066
Plus your ex-husband's suppression of you

15
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.700
This leads to higher sales.

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.600
I know you're still bragging

17
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.700
You know about my ex-husband

18
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.866
There is his suppression

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.733
Do you think you can make that much money?

20
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.600
Certainly.

21
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.200
You really brag about not making drafts

22
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.766
If you can do it

23
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.000
Not only did Uncle Sun give you his company

24
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.066
I will also give you my company

25
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.700
It's a deal.

26
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.800
But Shuang

27
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.966
Your office these days

28
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.600
And this secretary Zhou

29
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.966
You can lend it to me.

30
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.000
What are you going to do?

31
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.333
Xiao Zhou, you will listen to him these two days.

32
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.700
Do whatever he asks you to do?

33
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.066
Hey, Mr. Xia

34
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.166
Mr. Xia

35
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.666
Ah!

36
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.000
I will take care of Xiaoyan these two days.

37
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.700
If you don't want to disappoint Xiaoyan

38
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.966
Just sell it.

39
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.633
It's a serious company

40
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.166
Don't worry.

41
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.100
Secretary Zhou

42
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:31.466
Ah!

43
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.900
What? This is my plan

44
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:37.333
The gift box for New Year's packaging should be made ASAP.

45
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.900
Sell the goods

46
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.800
I don't do so much mess

47
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.700
Sister Shuang said

48
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.466
What do I ask you to do?

49
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.666
What do you do

50
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.366
Xiaoyan, I will not let you down again in this life.
