00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.500
You take advantage of me

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.566
Husband, this is what you said.

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.400
The trash who uses his wife's life-saving money to gamble

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.666
Oops, your mouth stinks

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.600
Waste will always be waste

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.100
If you don't have the ability, it will only be a benefit of words

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.966
Really?

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.166
Who ran away with his tail between his legs before?

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.066
Don't think that Sun Dong owes you a favor

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.266
If I help you once, you can be arrogant

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.300
Now I'll see who else can help you.

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.466
I don't need anyone to do business in autumn

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.566
If you lose one cent when selling gift boxes, I will lose two cents.

14
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.833
If you lose two cents, I will lose 4 cents.

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.500
See who can control who

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.800
Fang Yuan, you will lose a thousand by doing this.

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Is it interesting to hurt the enemy by 800?

18
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.233
Even if you continue to be stubborn, you can't stand it

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.566
My father-in-law is the president of the bank

20
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.400
As long as my husband wants money

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.100
Then go to the bank and get whatever you want.

22
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.300
Let alone a price reduction.

23
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.133
Even if it is a free gift box, we can't stand it.

24
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.766
How does it look like this trash?

25
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.800
I like this kind of shit

26
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.066
What are you doing, Tang Qian?

27
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.200
You were my best friend

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.000
It's okay if you pick up the man I don't want

29
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.766
How dare you spray shit in my office now

30
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.066
I slapped you today just to tell you

31
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.800
Don't pick up things in the future

32
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.466
And cure your stinky mouth

33
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.066
What right do you have to talk about me?

34
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.933
Didn't you also call your best friend's husband?

35
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:18.733
you

36
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.900
Husband, look at him and dare to do this in front of you

37
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.700
Xia Yushuang slapped me before

38
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.633
But didn't return it to him

39
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.066
Now you slap Qianqian again

40
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.800
I think you two really don't want to live anymore, do you?
