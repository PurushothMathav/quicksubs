00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.266
Made a special trip to thank you for thanking us of course

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.666
If it weren't for you

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.166
How did I know such a good sales plan?

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.266
You are obviously shameless

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.233
Are you learning from us?

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.700
Does your secretary have your say?

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.300
Do you have the right to speak as a little three?

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.366
Husband, look at him

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.066
Don't cry in front of me, talk about mercy

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.766
Take your people and get out of here

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.766
Don't be so heartless?

12
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.500
Anyway, one night husband and wife 100 days, right?

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.800
You said something so big happened to you

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.666
I see it in my eyes and it hurts in my heart.

15
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.933
So I'm here today

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.800
I came here specially to help you

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.266
You said you ruined it too

18
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.666
I can't supply the gift box either.

19
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.600
So everyone went to my place to buy it.

20
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.866
Then, I have insufficient liquidity.

21
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.366
So I'll give you a little donation, not much

22
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.100
I will donate 1,000 yuan to you.

23
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.366
Get out of here since you humiliated me with 1,000 bucks

24
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.766
Now take your money and get the hell out of here

25
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.600
No, sister

26
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.033
There is no reason to give money without it.

27
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800
A poor man is a poor man

28
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.033
Born cheap

29
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.666
1,000 yuan to hum

30
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.766
I'm still relying on this 1,000 yuan to turn over the book

31
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:17.466
Yo, turn it over, you make a billion with this 1,000

32
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.300
It will be Chinese New Year soon.

33
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.566
In such a short time

34
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.200
You want to make 100 million $1,000

35
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.333
That year, Chen Xiaodao earned 27 million yuan with 20 yuan

36
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.866
I use 1,000 yuan to earn 100 million yuan in one autumn
