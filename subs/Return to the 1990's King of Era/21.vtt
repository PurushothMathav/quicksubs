1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:05.700
1 million plus 20% net profit for the month

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.466
Monthly salary 1 million

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:11.000
The manager of our textile mill is only 150 yuan a month

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.133
Sun Dong is willing to spend 1 million

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.333
Zhang Yiqiu is more than 1 million

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.466
And 20% of the month's profit.

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.500
That's 2 million bet for a month

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.566
But is Yiqiu worth so much money?

9
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.366
Of course it is worth it in this market economy

10
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.066
Business talent like him is most lacking

11
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.200
I really envy you!

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.666
I found such a good man

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:30.966
Where is it?

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.666
It's not that you don't know how miserable I was before

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.000
That was before

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.766
How about now?

17
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.666
I believe he has reformed, but Sun Dong

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.133
You're a little bit inauthentic, aren't you?

19
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.566
Dig my people in front of me

20
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.766
Mr. Xia thanks and thanks

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.266
But normal business competition

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.700
My Sun will not be soft at all

23
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.566
A rare business genius like Mr. Yi

24
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.033
My grandson is determined to win

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.066
Don't pick on me

26
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.633
How do you choose one shot?

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.466
Double ring, Chairperson Sun's bid is so high

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.966
What do you think I should do?

29
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.133
Sun Dong's monthly salary 1 million

30
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.800
Plus 20% profit

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.666
The price is really high.

32
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.200
But I want to say sorry to you.

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.766
I'm afraid I have to refuse you.

34
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.466
If you think the monthly salary is low, I can do it. No, no, no.

35
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.366
It's not about the money.

36
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.566
Sister Shuang is so kind to me

37
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.066
How can I be cynical?

38
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.933
And now summer the food factory has a 20% stake

39
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.600
It's my own company

40
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.300
I can't even leave

41
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.800
Hey

42
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.333
OK.

43
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:40.133
Well, in half a month, the Jiangnan Business Exchange Conference will be held.

44
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.600
That's raising corporate awareness.

45
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.866
The perfect opportunity to make connections

46
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.633
Looking forward to seeing you at the exchange meeting.

47
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.366
Um, bye. OK.

48
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.200
Hey, that business exchange conference

49
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
Only those with assets over 100 million can participate

50
00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.600
Are you sure you can make so much money in half a month?

51
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.100
Just wait and see

52
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200
Wife should work hard now

53
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.400
It's broken. Something happened at the factory.
