00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.300
It's not too much for me to take 1,000 yuan and make 100 million yuan

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.700
Hahahaha hey

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.666
No, are you thinking of buying something?

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.866
From small to large

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:13.233
I have never seen such an arrogant person

6
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.500
Now you see

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.466
I see your whole body

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.833
Only the mouth is hard

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.200
You'll know in a few days.

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.300
Okay, okay, how about you on this earth?

11
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.400
If you can earn a billion with 1,000

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.466
I have your last name

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.233
Thank you.

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.700
This madman

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.800
Why are you taking pictures with reporters?

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.066
Tell me about it.

17
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.700
Directly one ball hurts my wife and hype it up

18
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.166
He also wants to learn

19
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.466
Don't hype it up

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.800
Ex-wife in distress

21
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
He volunteered to help copy the gift box

22
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.633
Copy our collection card promotion again.

23
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.800
And now I'm copying this.

24
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.000
He is too shameless

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.166
Yeah, he obviously burned down this warehouse

26
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.200
And with $1,000 to humiliate me

27
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.266
I was really blind to marry him

28
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.366
Don't worry, he does these now.

29
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.133
They all shoot their own walls

30
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.166
It's you

31
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.400
How do you make a billion dollars with 1,000 dollars?

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.100
This is way off the mark.

33
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.200
You don't want to go back to your old business and keep gambling, do you?

34
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.433
And even if it's gambling

35
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.266
It's impossible to make so much money.

36
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.100
I promised Xiaoyan

37
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.700
Never gamble again

38
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.566
It's Chinese New Year coming soon.

39
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.733
How can it be so fast?

40
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.266
Of course there are ways to make money violently
