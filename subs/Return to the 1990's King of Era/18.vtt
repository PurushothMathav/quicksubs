1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.900
We have already sold 5 cars

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.133
There are still so many people queuing up.

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.933
How much did that cost?

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.733
I don't know exactly how much it is.

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.866
Have to ask 10 bucks

6
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.600
Accountant, please report to Mr. Xia.

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.866
Mr. Xia has just been on sale for two hours.

8
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.066
Sales are 430,000

9
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.133
Two hours and 430,000

10
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.566
Because someone is stocking up in large quantities.

11
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.266
The customer who buys the most

12
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.733
I bought a truckload of tally

13
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.466
It's incredible.

14
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.866
It is also a little snack packaged.

15
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.133
I didn't expect it to be so popular

16
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.233
Yiqiu didn't expect you to be a bad gambler

17
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.900
Really capable?

18
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.700
Zhuo Linlin

19
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.500
What should you call me?

20
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.100
What did we say?

21
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.900
What should you call me if you lose a bet?

22
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.233
Hey, don't push your luck, boy.

23
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.600
Ok then you are busy

24
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.266
If you are busy, I will take care of Xiaoyan.

25
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.466
You get out

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.000
I don't want to see you.

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.833
Wife

28
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.533
I really changed my mind

29
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.033
I made at least 1 million today

30
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.033
Earn 1 million day

31
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.866
Did you take him to gamble? I'm not gambling

32
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.500
Not betting on what else can make 1 million day

33
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.266
Can you have a truth in your mouth?

34
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.166
Don't let me look down on you again, okay?

35
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.800
Xiaoyan

36
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.800
Xiaoyan Xiaoshuang

37
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.900
Did he lie to you?

38
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.633
Don't be afraid, I'm scolding him.

39
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.466
What is this?

40
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.066
Yixiu spent two days helping me make a lot of money

41
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.166
These are the dividends I promised him

42
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.366
A total of 700,000
