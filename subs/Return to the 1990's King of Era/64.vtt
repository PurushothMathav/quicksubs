00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.400
Buy all Zhou Linlin's warehouses and ask for a pair of glass.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.333
Now it's down to a few cents a share for a pair of glasses

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.366
Do you want to add more?

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.800
Of course, why did the jar break?

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.766
Your broken shares have fallen like this, are you still buying them?

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.666
I have never seen such a stupid person

7
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.966
Knowing that the stock market is falling, you have to seek death

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.100
Xiao Zhou, let's go to the warehouse.

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.433
Please invite him

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.566
OK.

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.333
Xia Yushuang

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.600
Did your brain go bad after you left me?

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.033
He's so stupid that you still believe him

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.733
Fang Yuan, I once believed in you

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.233
But what did you do?

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.666
With my former best friend Tang Qian

17
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.466
You cheated me out of all my money

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.900
If it weren't for the rock that saved me when I committed suicide

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.766
I've been killed by you now

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.466
It's not that you're stupid

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.800
I was really stupid before

22
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.600
I believed you once

23
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.433
But what did you bring me?

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.766
I believed in a ball many times

25
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.500
One goal didn't fail me once.

26
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.200
So this time

27
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.400
I still choose to believe in a ball

28
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.566
The stock of Mr. Xia's medicine pot glass has been bought

29
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.500
But my house is still falling.

30
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.733
Oops, his medicine pot glass

31
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.500
Don't you drop to a few cents a share?

32
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.366
It seems that you will be disappointed this time.
