1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.966
I'm the shop manager here

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.966
In the workshop, Tianwang Lao Tzu has to listen to me when he comes

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.766
That you don't still fantasize about your wife

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.866
Is it the director of the textile factory?

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.500
No fantasy

6
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.000
He is

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.200
Remember that Mr. Yi acquired our factory

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.666
Help us become the first company in the country

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.700
Completed the reform of the national flag

10
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.700
Corporate journalists from all over the country are coming to publicize and interview

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.666
Don't slack off

12
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.633
Mr. Yi and Mr. Yi's wife are

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.666
This autumn

14
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.666
It's a gamble. It ruins your brain.

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:34.000
I have no ability, and I still fantasize that my wife is the factory manager

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.966
The key is that Jiang Yan is so beautiful

17
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.900
I still don't give up on such waste

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.833
The two are really sick

19
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.200
You rotten gambler

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.166
Do you know what happened at the factory?

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.266
State-owned enterprise restructuring

22
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.066
Now the whole factory has been packed.

23
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.200
Sold to a company with a market value of several hundred million

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.700
And textile mills took the lead in restructuring

25
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
It has attracted great attention in the province

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.666
To put us

27
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.433
Create a benchmark for the reform of state-owned enterprises across the country

28
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.800
Can you decide such a big thing?

29
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.066
To manage him, a waste at the bottom of society

30
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.233
How do you know the news of the upper class?

31
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.500
Of course I know.

32
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.466
I bought this textile factory

33
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.766
What do you buy?

34
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.933
You're afraid you won't be able to buy a textile factory even if you gamble for ten years

35
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:15.400
Bar

36
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.900
Don't use your narrow thinking to fool others

37
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.400
My abilities you can't imagine

38
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.700
What are you capable of?

39
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.333
It's not so much gambling that you can afford a textile factory

40
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.900
Then you might as well ask your wife to sell it to you.

41
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.266
You dare to slander my wife again

42
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:35.133
I'll make your mouth speechless for the rest of your life

43
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.766
On the contrary, even I, the workshop manager, dare to hit

44
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.900
Someone who has the ability to call out

45
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.700
I'll see who dares to do it
