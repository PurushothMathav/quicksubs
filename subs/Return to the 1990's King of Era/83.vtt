00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.100
What is this?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.466
This is our secret weapon for marketing this year

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.300
What is this?

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.166
It looks like a computer, but it only has a keyboard.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.933
This is a bully game console

6
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.166
Games can be played.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Oh yes yes

8
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.866
Come on, this is hard.

9
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.266
You can try it too

10
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.766
Oh, this is so much fun

11
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.600
Of course it's fun.

12
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.800
And this can also be exchanged for different cards.

13
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.966
And this game console?

14
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.366
Insert different cards and play different games

15
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.766
With alloy warheads

16
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.700
Mario and Contra

17
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.433
Market share 80%

18
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.166
No children playing games

19
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.366
4 of them are playing bully

20
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.566
So terrifying

21
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.200
It just so happens that no one has discovered this chess game yet.

22
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.700
What about this game console?

23
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.666
What does it have to do with selling Chinese New Year gift boxes?

24
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.900
Of course it does.

25
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.266
It's called bundling.
