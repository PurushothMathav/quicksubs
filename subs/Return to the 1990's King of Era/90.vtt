00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.533
Why are there so many people? Isn't it Chinese New Year soon?

2
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.066
They are all in a hurry to go home.

3
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.633
I'm a little hungry and happened to bring food from home

4
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.733
Yes, it's cold.

5
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.166
Yes, it would be nice if there was a barrel of instant noodles.

6
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.600
You can eat something hot

7
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.200
Right.

8
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.366
In this era, Kang Shuaifu braised beef noodles have not yet come out

9
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.000
When Mr. Wei discovered that mainlanders appeared from afar

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.200
No barrels of pasta

11
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.566
A record 61 packs of Kang Shuaifu instant noodles sold annually

12
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.166
Yes, it's Spring Festival travel soon.

13
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000
What a huge opportunity.

14
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.566
What's up?

15
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.766
Wife, don't eat

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.700
Let's do something important with me first

17
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.000
But

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.900
Aren't you going to get into the Xiaobawang game console?

19
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.966
Wait until I'm done with this

20
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.100
Let's go to the bully game console together

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.866
How about this?

22
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:13.866
You go back first

23
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.466
I will go to the south to buy goods by myself.

24
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.166
Anyway, you've already told me all the points

25
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.466
What's wrong with me?

26
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.000
You look down on me

27
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.866
I've had some experience managing textile mills recently

28
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:29.066
Well, I'm no worse than Yu Shuang now

29
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.666
I believe you.

30
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.733
Put things here

31
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.466
Be careful yourself

32
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.933
Earth, you have changed so much.

33
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.200
I can't fall behind either

34
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.600
The purchase channel of the Xiaobawang game console this time

35
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.033
I will definitely get through
