00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.700
Hahaha god

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.300
I think you are crazy

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.100
If you are really capable, you will let him grow up

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.666
I don't believe you can predict the future

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.566
It's boring to predict the future

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.800
This era

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.966
I would rather use my hands to create the future

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.266
What a hopeless psychopath

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.366
Since you are so great

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.266
Tell me about it.

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.566
How much do you want for a pair of glass?

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.800
It also grows to

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.666
100 bucks.

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
Hahahahaha what hahaha

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.266
Find 100 bucks for 5 cents

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.466
How humorous!

17
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.933
Husband, don't say he's really shit

18
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.333
You can grow your lips

19
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.866
If this stock goes up to $100 for 5 cents

20
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.300
Let me eat shit

21
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.466
It's still a dream

22
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.333
What a savings. I can't just keep my medicine in the pot

23
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.600
Raised to 100 yuan each

24
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.866
And get your sauce tech down to five cents.

25
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.900
I'm looking forward to it. Don't worry.

26
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.433
I won't let you down.

27
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.900
Mr. Xia Yi

28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.733
Didn't you two have an accident at the factory?

29
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.133
How do you have time to come? I have a big watch here.

30
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.000
We're here to ask for your help

31
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.933
Mr. Yi, you are too polite

32
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.066
You have provided me with so much

33
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.300
Popular material for the Chinese New Year

34
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.033
I'm worried about not having a chance to thank you

35
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.733
Tell me what to do

36
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:22.433
I want you to help spread a fake news

37
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.166
fake news
