00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.300
Fake news doesn't work

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.000
Fake news

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.833
For my professional integrity as a journalist

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.100
It's not actually fake news.

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.966
Just know the inside information in advance

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.500
Just let you be exposed in advance

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.466
One of the first messages you know

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.500
How important is it for journalists?

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.866
But what if it's fake?

10
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.900
Not in case

11
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.466
If history hadn't changed

12
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.966
And those two things are happening right now.

13
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.833
Don't worry about the content of these two messages.

14
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.033
Just report it

15
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.133
It can definitely make you an alternative in the industry

16
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.133
Then say it.

17
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.933
The first car, the largest shareholder of Daoxiang Technology

18
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.766
Corporate performance is widely affected

19
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.000
The second Fuyao glass factory

20
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.700
Reached a strategic cooperation with a well-known foreign automaker

21
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.000
Financing nearly 10 billion

22
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.600
Anyway, these two pieces of news are really explosive enough.

23
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.300
Are you kidding me?

24
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.733
If these two messages are rewarded

25
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.600
I'm willing to sell all my property

26
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.466
But if this news is true

27
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.966
Are you sure you can have your first sip of soup?

28
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.000
Mr. Haoyi

29
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.300
If you say so

30
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.033
Then I trust you, Joan

31
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.933
Are you sure you want to publish these two news?

32
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.100
Can affect the skeleton

33
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.900
Certainly.

34
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.866
Xiao Zhou

35
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.066
You will go back to the food factory and log in to the official website of the newspaper.

36
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.433
Print this news

37
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.200
Take it to the stock market to distribute

38
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.066
OK, I see.

39
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.200
Don't miss it when you pass by

40
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.266
Come and see, come and get it.

41
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.166
Fresh inside information

42
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.900
Bao Lei, the boss of Maoxiang Technology, invested and took the initiative to run away

43
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.233
Don't raise tens of billions in the pot

44
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:21.933
What!

45
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.100
The largest cologne of Jiaoxiang Technology has actually withdrawn its investment

46
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.700
This stock has to be sold quickly.

47
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.900
And this medicine pot.

48
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.866
It actually won tens of billions of orders internationally

49
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.000
Gotta buy it quickly
