00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.233
Oh.

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.133
It turned out that the one who bought the medicine fluoride glass was taken advantage of

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.733
It's you, I suggest you sell it quickly

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.800
Otherwise, you will lose everything.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.266
Who are you scaring?

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.533
Medicine talisman glass has grown so much now

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.800
How could you lose money?

8
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.900
I admit that you saw the Chinese medicine practitioner glass president before

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.566
A little skill

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.033
But now you make your own money and don't let everyone else make it.

11
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.500
Are you being a little stingy?

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.300
Right?

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.800
That's right, you said before that this medicine talisman glass can grow

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.933
Just luck

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:32.900
What to pack

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.933
Now we have bought medicine talisman glass in the whole warehouse.

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.400
You make money, don't let us make it

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.566
You are so wicked

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.733
Well since you don't listen to me

20
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.900
No wonder I am

21
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.800
Let's go to clear the warehouse.

22
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.100
Hello, help me clear the warehouse.

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.600
Hold on.

24
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.133
Sir, your stock has been sold.

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.366
A total profit of 4 million yuan

26
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.300
Please keep it. Thank you.

27
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.566
Now the glass is gaining momentum

28
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.200
Why is the warehouse suddenly cleared?

29
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.066
Although the medicinal glass was successfully financed

30
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.366
It was withdrawn that same day.

31
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.133
So the stock price is bound to go down like an avalanche

32
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.600
Why did you suddenly withdraw your investment?

33
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.000
If I remember correctly

34
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.433
Just a few minutes ago

35
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.866
The director of the pharmaceutical glass factory

36
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.733
There was a mistake in displaying the product.

37
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.933
And their glass

38
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.800
There was a major quality issue

39
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.000
So shareholders are negotiating a collective withdrawal

40
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.966
Hey, isn't that right?

41
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.133
You have been under my nose all day today

42
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.900
How did you know this news?

43
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.500
Can conceive

44
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.166
This is a medicine man, why did the glass fall?

45
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.166
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's falling too fast, right?

46
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.900
Why did you lose 30 points in a while?

47
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.300
husband

48
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.866
I'll be really told by that trash on Earth

49
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.633
The medicine man's glass will fall back, right? Impossible

50
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.233
Medicine man glass

51
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.233
Will definitely get it back

52
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.633
Climb up. Climb up.

53
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.833
Finished tray

54
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.700
Otherwise, the fox will lose another 5 cents

55
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:56.633
We only have 100,000 $10 million left

56
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.866
Mr. Huang, thank you for the next ten million

57
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:01.766
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to earn so much.

58
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.300
Brat what did you do

59
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.366
It's just a simple pig killing altar

60
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:09.000
And you are the most persistent

61
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:12.933
Mr. Fang, thank you for the 1,000 yuan.

62
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.566
Without the $1,000

63
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.266
We can't make 4 million

64
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.500
Now this $1,000

65
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.100
Return you, you are fucking weak
