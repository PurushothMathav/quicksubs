00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.800
Security guard

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.066
Break the legs of the three people who were secretly left behind

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.233
Throw it out and wait a minute

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.466
Dad?

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.866
You are the gambler

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.300
Waste ball, sir, can you speak?

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.233
How can you open your mouth and say that others are trash?

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.833
Isn't it?

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.166
In order to gamble with his wife and children

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.866
Even my wife's life-saving money is gambled

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.600
People like him

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.700
Calling him a waste insults the word waste

13
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.266
Just trash like him

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.500
What qualifications do you have to participate in a conference like ours?

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.566
What a party

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.666
Come here.

17
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.200
It's an insult to our upper class

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.366
We at the top are civilized people

19
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.200
I don't want to do anything to you.

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.833
Or get out by yourself

21
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.566
Claiming to be an upper class person

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.600
Even basic right and wrong

23
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.700
What civilized person are you pretending to be?

24
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:56.066
One ball, my dad has already given you the step down

25
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.466
Don't be shameless

26
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.700
You are the ones who give shameless face, right?

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.666
We only entered the venue after passing Stefanie.

28
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.166
Nonsense

29
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.000
I heard from my son that you made millions in the stock market

30
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.566
What's the point of this?

31
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.700
You need 100 million to get in here

32
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.200
You don't want to say

33
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.200
After investing in stocks

34
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.566
I made a hundred million in such a short time

35
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.900
No, definitely not.

36
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.200
I knew it.

37
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.033
You can't make 100 million in such a short time

38
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.066
We made a billion what?
