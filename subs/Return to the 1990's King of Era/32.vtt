1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.766
I'm afraid there's nothing.

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's take a look.

3
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.466
Our real Cary

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.766
They all have this individually numbered seat anti-counterfeiting mark.

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.300
And there is nothing in the square card

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.766
Enough to prove that he forged the card

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.600
Oh, really?

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.700
This real card has numbers.

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.366
Yes, then this square circle is a liar.

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:19.866
So shameless

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.900
It's this liar.

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.466
To think of such a dirty way

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.766
Also lie to others that the car is real

14
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.166
Hey, how can you pretend it's okay?

15
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.466
People want to leave

16
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:34.900
What do you want?

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.566
Come and smear our company's reputation

18
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.500
Also counterfeit cards to defraud prizes

19
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.200
This is already a scam.

20
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.066
And the amount is huge

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.600
Tell me if you want public information or private information.

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.500
What public information is private?

23
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.600
If it is private, it will cost two money.

24
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.133
What about public?

25
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.200
Your fraud amount has reached 20 million

26
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.700
If I want to call the police

27
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.266
At least 10 years in prison

28
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.066
Don't say

29
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.500
At least we have so many couples

30
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.200
How dare you send me to prison?

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.466
You asked the wrong person.

32
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.833
I said it doesn't count

33
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.133
That

34
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.500
You say brother

35
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.300
Is this business?

36
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.766
I was just confused.

37
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.400
You see, we don't have a big grudge or a big grudge.

38
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.066
So you let me go

39
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.200
Let's go private

40
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.700
Ok, I don't want more from you either.

41
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800
How much 2 million
