00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Mr. Yi

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.066
What's the matter with me?

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.833
Journalists, please have a seat

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.133
Reporter Liu

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.700
You must have heard about our recent affairs, right?

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.333
I see, but I believe in your character, Mr. Yi

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.466
But the Guangliu reporter believed it was useless.

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.900
I want everyone to believe

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.133
I have no problem with my wife.

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.866
Ok what do you want me to do

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.533
I want reporter Liu to help me publish an article

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.566
rumor-refuting statement

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.400
The content of the statement is that I want to buy the textile factory

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.933
As a birthday present for my wife

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.000
Pardon me?

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
You want to buy a textile mill?

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.800
That's the flag.

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.866
As far as I know

19
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.766
Private individuals can also purchase shares in the flag

20
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.766
And among the first batch of restructuring lists were textile mills

21
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.000
Mr. Yi, you are really well-informed.

22
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.866
The restructuring of state-owned enterprises is a national taboo

23
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.100
If you do

24
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.300
Not only will it receive support at the national level

25
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.400
And buy a company as big as a textile factory

26
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.200
Give to wife

27
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.866
The rumors in the newspapers must have been self-defeating

28
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.833
kill two birds with one stone

29
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.700
autumn

30
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.633
Buy a textile factory and give it to my wife as a double gift

31
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.266
Good for you!

32
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.800
So I also asked reporter Liu to help report

33
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.766
Don't worry.

34
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.866
Such reporting is in line with the national public policy

35
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:05.733
I would love that.

36
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.533
OK.

37
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.500
I'm going to my wife's factory to find the factory manager.

38
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.100
By the way, let my wife know

39
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.833
He's going to be the factory manager.
