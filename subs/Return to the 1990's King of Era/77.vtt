00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.166
Second Aunt, how do you hit people?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.500
What happened when I hit someone?

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.866
It makes sense for you to borrow money or not

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.866
I owe your family a difficult time first

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.766
My family borrowed 20,000 from you and didn't ask you for it?

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.833
You old thing

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.700
When did our family owe you 20,000?

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.933
Do you have an IOU?

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.866
I think they are all real relatives

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.600
I didn't let the IOU, oops.

11
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.100
You don't have an IOU, what the hell are you talking about?

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.800
I have a real IOU

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.533
At first, you borrowed 5,000 yuan

14
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.500
Now, give me 50,000

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.800
What? 5,000?

16
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100
It's only been 10 times in a month

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.633
Is that still human?

18
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.566
I'm not human

19
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.600
It is also better than you who took the daughter-in-law's life-saving money

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.500
But the clogged wimp is strong

21
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.900
It has your mother's handprint on it

22
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.066
Why do you still want to default?

23
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.200
I can't read either

24
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.733
How did I know I had to pay 50,000 after borrowing 5,000?

25
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.100
I don't care if you can read

26
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.466
I have to 50,000 today anyway

27
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.633
One less word, I'm not done with your dad

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.966
Stop talking nonsense and pay back the money

29
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.100
Pay back the money quickly

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.166
Oh, come on.

31
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.766
Why are you bullying me like that?

32
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.066
Aren't we all relatives?

33
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.366
What happened to the relative?

34
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.466
The brothers have to settle the accounts clearly.

35
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.133
Then why are you beating people?

36
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.766
What happened when I hit someone?

37
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.100
They borrowed money and didn't pay it back

38
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.566
What's wrong with me?

39
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.066
Hey, big deal. That 50,000 bucks

40
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.266
I asked him to pay 1,000 less.

41
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.066
A slap for 1,000, right?

42
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.500
Stick your face out and let me slap you

43
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.800
I'll give you ten thousand.
