00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.266
Well, there are better ways to make money.

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.800
You're not going to sell your organs, are you?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.300
That's too much.

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.900
I've tasted what it's like to be mutilated.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.466
That's not what ordinary people can bear

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.366
I mean in a dream

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.300
The opportunity to make money is in the stock market

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.766
Stock market, I have money

9
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:24.966
He likes to trade stocks

10
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.533
If you invest so much money, you will lose it all.

11
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.666
I have so many friends around me

12
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.733
But no one can make money in the stock market

13
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:35.466
Yes, and the stock market is like gambling

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.533
It's impossible to make money and you're not careful.

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.300
Do you want it?

16
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.200
Stop, I thought about it

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.566
For you

18
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.300
Nothing seems impossible.

19
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.200
So I believe you.

20
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.066
What about you? I seem to believe you now

21
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.466
There is no other way

22
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.400
Okay, let's pick up the sacks and go to the stock market to load the money

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.666
Sir?

24
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.700
Your $500 drug and glass stock has been traded

25
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.800
Done. Good luck. Thank you.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.800
What about Sister Fang? Sister Fang went to see the stock situation.

27
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.600
Yiqiu must not buy that medicine talisman glass

28
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.966
Quickly withdraw the transaction
