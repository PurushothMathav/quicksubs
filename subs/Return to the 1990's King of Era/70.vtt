00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.866
Our medication glass has really gone up

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:02.800
How is that possible?

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.433
How can so many people soak their hands?

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.700
Why do so many takeaways have to be served by glass?

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.733
Are they all fools like a ball?

6
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.266
You are the fools

7
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.366
Your sauce-flavored technology has fallen through the cracks.

8
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.700
Our pill glass has gone up 20 points for me

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.700
Just dropped a point

10
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.033
You just went from one cent to three cents.

11
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.400
What to be proud of

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.300
Didn't you say it was going to go up to 100 yuan?

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.533
What's there to be proud of now that it's up to 2 points?

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.566
Hmm, what a villain

15
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.200
I'm happy if I fell so much and gained 2 points

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.533
Xia is finally a strong woman in business

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.400
To believe such a fool

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.133
Ignorant people are scary

19
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.066
You're wrong.

20
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.433
Ignorance is not terrible

21
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.000
The ignorant and unaware are terrible

22
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.466
As the saying goes, one life, two life, three life, three life, all things.

23
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.900
I don't say stop when he starts growing

24
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.133
He won't stop.

25
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.600
You are less mysterious

26
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.500
If he could find a dollar

27
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.766
Me and women

28
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.300
Hey, the windshield has risen by another 6 points.

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.500
A dime?

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.333
Too fast, too fast, 3 cents, already 3 cents

31
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.600
It's true that the sauce flavor technology is actually low

32
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.800
In just a moment, it has already dropped 5 points

33
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.066
Is it over? Sauce Technology has lost 10 points.

34
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.433
Too fast too fast

35
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.500
Husband's medicinal glass has really risen to 1 yuan

36
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.066
I fucking use you to say

37
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.300
I'm not blind

38
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.300
Dialect

39
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.566
Now the medicinal glass has risen to 1.5 yuan

40
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:25.166
Is it time for you to change your name to Congressman?
