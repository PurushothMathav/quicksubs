1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.766
Is that better?

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.700
Ah much better

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.466
Who?

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.966
Who's sneaking around there?

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:12.933
What's up?

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.300
Someone was there just now and didn't know what to do

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.400
Maybe trying to steal something

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.666
That should be fine.

9
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.733
By the way, how is the sales status now?

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.933
The current turnover is 10 million a day

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.966
Down a month

12
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.166
The total turnover can reach 300 million

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.700
What? Sometimes I hit 300 million.

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.600
Or Yixiu Ge's marketing is useful

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.766
Now your ex-husband's Fang Chang Food Company

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.300
Even if they cut prices every day

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.333
But no one buys gift boxes from him anymore.

18
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.700
He's been out of luck these days

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.766
It's still a little worse than I expected

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.866
After all, in this age

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.633
Media information is still poor

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.433
What era?

23
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.166
Oh, I mean

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.233
Just hit my card with the dividend

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200
Nothing much happened.

26
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.066
I'll go back and take care of Xiaoyan first

27
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.100
Wife, look what I bought again

28
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.333
Dad is a badass

29
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.866
Bullying mom again

30
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.633
Mom?

31
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.900
Wife, why are you packing your bags?

32
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.166
Nothing.

33
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.800
Let's get a divorce.
