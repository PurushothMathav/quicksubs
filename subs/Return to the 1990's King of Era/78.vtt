00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.000
What?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.066
Pardon me?

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.500
A slap 10,000

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.566
Oops you rotten gambler

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.366
Pretend to be rich with me here, right?

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.566
I'll see if you can pull out 10,000

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.766
Just a slap 10,000 right?

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.200
How dare you blow

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.700
If you were that rich

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.400
I'm also standing here for you to fight

11
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.466
See if you can come up with 10,000

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.666
Or I'll smash your face in

13
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.300
A hopeless gambler

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.266
You owe me a thousand dollars

15
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.800
And yelling about slapping people for 10,000 yuan

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.866
How dare you be so arrogant if you don't owe money?

17
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.466
No wonder he's a loser

18
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.633
I'll try it.

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.600
Oh, you can't fight.

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.833
Your second aunt's son is an official in the Chamber of Commerce

21
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.200
If you hit your second aunt

22
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.466
What about your business with Xiaoshuang?

23
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.433
Mom, this kind of person is just kicking his nose on his face

24
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.066
Don't give them some color to see

25
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.500
They will only get worse

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.900
You don't have to worry about business

27
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.300
Ouch hey I heard that right

28
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.900
You gambler

29
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.900
When will you start doing business?

30
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.100
Ouch.

31
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.800
You wimp, if you could do business

32
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.866
That sow can climb a tree

33
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.500
Oh yeah, stop talking nonsense and pay back the money.

34
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.033
Good money I will pay

35
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.533
But a slap of 10,000 has not been hit yet

36
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.366
Yo ho

37
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.166
I see you are endless

38
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.433
Come come come

39
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.966
I'll just stand.

40
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.600
Let you fight let you fight let you fight

41
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.833
I see you have tens of thousands of dollars to ask for money, right?

42
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:35.066
Keep your eyes peeled.

43
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.566
That's a lot of money.

44
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:48.666
Put your face

45
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.200
