00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.966
Don't worry about that.

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.300
I have promised my parents

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.966
Won't worry him anymore

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.300
OK

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.400
See when you have arrived recently.

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.100
Husband, we have gone up two more points.

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.666
It's already 7 o'clock

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.166
70,000. That's great

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.100
Much better than some people who don't pretend to understand

10
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.466
What should Mr. Xia do?

11
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.366
Yiqiu, you once said

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.466
Let the investors go crazy and grab the stocks of Medicine Talisman Glass

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.400
He will raise the price.

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.966
But now he has fallen like this

15
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.233
Who would buy it?

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.400
That's right, it's time to fart. Good news

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.800
What's the good news?

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.733
The good news is to make investors feel

19
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.266
Stocks have room to rise

20
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.333
Let investors feel

21
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.166
This stock has room for appreciation in the future

22
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.700
They will go crazy buying

23
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.000
So what do we do now?

24
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.800
I can only ask reporter Liu for help.

25
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.833
Hey stop

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.066
You can't go

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.400
Yo how

28
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.966
I see it doesn't work.

29
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.766
Ready to run, no running

30
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.700
I just take the glass according to my medicine

31
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.933
It's not the trash can you bought to rise.

32
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.800
Has fallen below the issue price

33
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.400
You expect him to grow up?

34
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.800
I really think of myself as a character

35
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.200
I still want to manipulate the stock price

36
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
Of course, if I wanted to

37
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.633
No matter how rubbish the stock is, I can make it go up
