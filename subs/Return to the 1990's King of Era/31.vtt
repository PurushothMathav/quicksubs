00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.900
I think it's you who cheated

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.966
Hey to the chief

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.733
How did I cheat?

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.466
I really work

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.166
Right.

6
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.333
We collected this card in their gift box.

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.700
Is that right, but Yiqiu's place

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.666
I will interview Lu Zhijie for every audience member who wins the lottery.

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.500
So far, 3 people have received the car.

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.266
10 people received the washing machine.

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.166
I have a record in this video recorder

12
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.666
Would you like to take a look?

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.833
Do you have records?

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.166
This reporter Liu Da said that he has a record of receiving awards

15
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.100
This is going to be on TV.

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.300
There are big journalists who definitely don't lie

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.466
So the food factory didn't lie to us in the summer?

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.100
Could it be that you can really receive the award?

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.900
Reporter Liu

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.366
Although you do have a record

21
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.700
But it's very likely that they found it

22
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.666
It must be Toh.

23
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
Otherwise, we won the lottery, why didn't he give it to us?

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.266
Yeah, why don't I talk to you?

25
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.333
Don't you have a point in your heart?

26
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.200
That means your activity is completely fake.

27
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.433
fake

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.400
Stop confusing black and white for me.

29
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.966
What's wrong with the card?

30
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.700
My card is clearly the same

31
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.600
I'm afraid you don't know yet

32
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.200
Cary produced by us

33
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.500
All have independent numbered maps for anti-counterfeiting identification

34
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.400
And you, Cary

35
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.500
I'm afraid there's nothing.
