00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.066
What do you mean?

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.600
I'm going to open a little bully game hall

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.766
Let people play for free

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.200
Free, isn't that a loss?

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.000
No.

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.166
Free is the most expensive.

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.400
Because free can attract a lot of people to come and play.

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.366
Then we will take the opportunity to launch

9
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.266
Xiaobawang New Year's game console gift box

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.133
I see.

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:19.666
Just put

12
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.000
The Xiaobawang game console is bundled with the Chinese New Year gift box.

13
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.800
Start and then use

14
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.900
The sales of Xiaobawang game consoles

15
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.966
To drive the sales of gift boxes

16
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:25.733
Exactly.

17
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.600
At that time, the New Year's gift box market occupied by Fang Yuan

18
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.100
Can be snatched back by us all

19
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.133
And the profit of the game console itself

20
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.166
Also quite tall

21
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.933
But so many game consoles

22
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.333
Where are we going to get it?

23
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm going to the south to talk to the manufacturer.

24
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.600
It's a long journey.

25
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.700
Then I'll go with you

26
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.833
Then please find the venue for the game console.

27
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.366
No problem, I'll check it out now.

28
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.100
Come here mom

29
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.333
Are you watching TV?

30
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.500
Xiaorou, we are playing a game. Come on

31
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.700
Dad teaches you to play games

32
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.933
Here, take this. This is going forward.

33
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.166
This is the back.

34
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.866
What a waste. Jump from here to there

35
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.366
Jump there and you fly.

36
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.466
Wow, we ran and jumped.

37
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.966
Why didn't I find you so good at coaxing children before?

38
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.133
You will find out later

39
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.900
More advantages for your husband
