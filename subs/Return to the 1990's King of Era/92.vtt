00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.066
I have a fucking useless son like you

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:07.466
You can give me 1,200 net losses for a full 15 million

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.500
I beat your dad to death

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.066
Is our uncle calling?

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.366
Don't be angry don't be angry

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.766
It's not my fault.

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.433
Who knew that bastard Yiqiu could control the stock price?

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.133
Fucking community pits me fucking you fart

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.133
I asked my friends in the stock market.

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.766
No one controls the stock price at all

11
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.500
15 million holes

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.566
What do I bet

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.433
I'll kill you, dad, dad

14
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.833
Don't be angry.

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.166
So atmospheric

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.066
Love is bad

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.666
Xiaoqian is not that I want to be angry

18
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.766
I hate that iron can't make steel

19
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.800
Little eye this trash

20
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.666
He can't even run the company now, oops dad

21
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.266
song ordering

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.200
Can he trick the company into proving his ability?

23
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.366
Same as you.

24
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.000
Tiger father without dog son

25
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.766
Haha, okay.

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.900
That's nice.

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.800
Dad?

28
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.966
This is not immediately that.

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.666
Is there a Jiangnan business exchange meeting?

30
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.733
What then?

31
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.933
I took some investment at the exchange meeting

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.200
Isn't the hole in your bank filled?

33
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.000
Humph

34
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.833
The people at the business exchange meeting are like people

35
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.800
What do you protect them with?

36
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.400
Dad, don't worry.

37
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.266
Although that bastard Yiqiu

38
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.800
Although he is a waste

39
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.466
But I learned something from him.

40
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.966
Packaging sales and Chica prize sales

41
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.133
These two things?

42
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.766
It's all that no one else has

43
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:31.733
When is the time?

44
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.366
It must be able to fool the investment well

45
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.166
Look back, look at your performance

46
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:41.700
I'm going back to the house to rest, hey, slow down.

47
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.266
Hello

48
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.566
Xia Yushuang and Ye Qiu

49
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.166
Opened the Xiaobawang game hall

50
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.066
Ah, it's free!

51
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.200
It's alright, hang up?

52
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.233
Are they both fools?

53
00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.566
What kind of money can you make by opening a free game hall?

54
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.866
These two idiots

55
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.200
After the exchange meeting

56
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.666
Don't see much to clean them up
