00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.566
Husband, let's just leave

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.866
It's too cheap to take a break with that rain, right?

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.566
The real estate manager will let Yixiu get any benefits.

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.500
A bad gambler

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.300
self-righteous

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.600
I bah

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.833
Is Lao Tzu's money so easy to get?

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.666
It's a dog man and a woman

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.300
Don't make me comfortable

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.833
They don't think it's better than you

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.700
Good house, don't worry.

12
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.500
I'm good at this kind of thing

13
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.500
Hey, husband, what did you let the dog do?

14
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900
Isn't that kid Yiqiu proud?

15
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.466
I set his backyard on fire.

16
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.066
This marketing model is the convenience store marketing model

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.966
The same product can be sold nationwide.

18
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.500
You probably get the idea.

19
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.566
I understand, it's you who lost your legs.

20
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.800
Can enjoy this chain store marketing model

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.733
Hey, hey, are you alright?

22
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.800
Don't worry, it seems to be cramping.

23
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.300
I have a cramp, please rub it for me.

24
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.766
Here? Up here?

25
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.766
A little higher up

26
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.300
A little bit up here.

27
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.433
It can't go any higher.
