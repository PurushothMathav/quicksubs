1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.733
I can help you solve your factory

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.866
The problem of broken capital chain

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.133
Do you think I'm crazy?

4
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.700
Will believe you gambler

5
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.933
It is now in the trend of market economy reform

6
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.366
You can raise money by issuing intra-corporate bonds.

7
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.366
Too many to say

8
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.200
200,000 more than enough

9
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.366
Issuance of internal creditor's rights

10
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.566
For corporate employees

11
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.433
Issuance of internal debt at high interest rates

12
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.366
Regular one month

13
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.700
At that time, you can recover 100 yuan with interest.

14
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.300
20 bucks a month.

15
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.400
I believe in such bonds

16
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.933
Employees should be happy to buy

17
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.833
20% interest is ridiculous

18
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.266
But you don't raise money fast.

19
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.400
The fund chain is broken.

20
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.366
Your business will go backwards immediately

21
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.800
How do you know?

22
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.900
Methods of issuing intra-corporate bonds

23
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.966
That's what they do in Hong Kong movies.

24
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.366
and

25
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.100
There are indeed many foreign companies that rely on this trick to survive

26
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.966
It looks good that you have such mature breasts.

27
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.166
Then you go back to the company with me now

28
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.866
Develop a detailed plan

29
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.500
Don't you dare tell me

30
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.433
You're just a wimp who can talk on paper

31
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.633
How dare you

32
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.666
This bond issuance plan was really written by you

33
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.600
Why didn't I know you knew this before?

34
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.600
That didn't give me a chance to show it before

35
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.266
Secretary Zhou immediately followed the above plan

36
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.566
Print intra-corporate bonds

37
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.300
Stamp the official seal

38
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.866
And issue bonds in full broadcast Yes

39
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.766
Attention all employees

40
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:37.433
In response to the reform of the national market economy

41
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.433
Issuance of intra-corporate bonds with an interest rate of 20%

42
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.166
100 yuan a month can get 20 yuan interest

43
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.500
Mr. Xia is leaning on a piece of broken paper

44
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.666
Can we get 200,000?

45
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.200
A dead horse is a living horse doctor

46
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.833
There is no other way now.

47
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.400
Sister Shuang, just think about it

48
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.466
I vowed to give Mr. Xia 200,000

49
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.166
I haven't even raised 20 yuan now

50
00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.666
I don't know what maze you visited for Mr. Xia

51
00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.966
I can't believe your nonsense

52
00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:22.766
Linlin

53
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.100
That's enough!
