00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.600
Mr. Fang, you have already lost

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.433
The 5 million of this card

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.833
So I took it.

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.066
Proud in hindsight

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.300
Haven't closed yet

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.966
Fangyuan, your sauce-flavored technology

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.966
It has been reduced to a dime a share

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:18.066
Your 1 million is 10,000

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.866
I haven't counted your pride yet.

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.866
I have money waiting

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.766
Hey dad give me 10 million and I want more than

12
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.866
Husband, do we still want to buy that soy sauce technology?

13
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.900
Are you stupid?

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.600
Now that medicine talisman glass is growing so powerful

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.900
Of course you bought the medicine talisman glass?

16
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.833
10 million medicine talisman glass

17
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.200
Please wait a moment.

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.200
This medicine talisman glass is growing slowly without money

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.766
Yeah, it means the good news in my newspaper

20
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.433
It can only be absorbed like this

21
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.866
Hey, no, it's gone up again.

22
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.300
It has risen to 200 yuan a share

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.500
It means that a large amount of money was injected at this time

24
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.100
Just at this time, it's time for the miscellaneous plate.

25
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.633
We can make 4 million

26
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.000
However, this person who injected a large sum of money

27
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.466
Almost miserable

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.800
So what do we do now?

29
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.800
Clear the warehouse immediately

30
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.600
What, clear the warehouse immediately?

31
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.266
Hahahaha

32
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:25.300
Are you really stupid?

33
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.866
Now it's time to officially look for a pair of glasses.

34
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.533
Are you clearing the warehouse now?

35
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.500
We directly bought 10 million key glass

36
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.100
This time you must win
