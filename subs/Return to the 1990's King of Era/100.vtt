00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:05.966
Be careful

2
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.866
Just two times and still dancing knives and guns here

3
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.400
stand up

4
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.233
You wait for me.

5
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.766
I'll be back.

6
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.900
Husband husband

7
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.500
Sister, do you think I can follow you?

8
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.500
After all, we were best friends before

9
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.766
You take me to make some money, I can do anything

10
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.466
Very capable roll

11
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.566
Brother Earth

12
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.666
You are the protagonist of this business conference

13
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:57.000
In the future, I will use you as my backer

14
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.933
You are welcome.

15
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.566
As the youngest young talent in the city

16
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.466
Let me tell you a few words

17
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.166
Okay.

18
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.666
I'll just say a few words

19
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.500
actually

20
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:12.966
This era is a golden age everywhere

21
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.466
It was a time of booming commerce.

22
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.033
innovation

23
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:22.366
That's the only way that technology can be driven.

24
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.966
Ok ok ok ok

25
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.333
Hahahahaha

26
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.333
Look what you mean by that guy in black

27
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.300
Looking at the hat is silly

28
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.566
autumn

29
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.766
Is this lucky money for Rou Rou too much?

30
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.366
Nothing much

31
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.900
When I give him compensation?

32
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.600
Right? Bye.

33
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.133
So nice. So nice.

34
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.500
Does Xiaoyan not need to worry about being poor now?

35
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.866
Earn too much

36
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.766
Hey, but have you thought about it?

37
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.100
What is the next entrepreneurial direction?

38
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.533
I've decided not to make food

39
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm gonna do it

40
00:01:55.666 --> 00:02:00.433
I have thought about the name of the software, so I will call it QQ.

41
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:06.066
How about you have the confidence to stud with me?

42
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:07.833
Why not?

43
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.900
Then we will become bigger, stronger and create greater brilliance.

44
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.066
Ah!

45
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.700
Ah!

46
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.700
Hahahaha
