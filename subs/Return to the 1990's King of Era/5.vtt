00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.666
How long has this been waiting?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.166
How could this box of broken paper be turned into money?

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.333
How many times has Mr. Xia lied to you?

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.766
How can you still believe him?

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.600
Dad?

6
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.700
I deserve to make this world

7
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.566
I shouldn't have believed him

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.900
Go away

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.366
A waste that can't even support his wife and children

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.800
I said cool sister

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.700
In this era, workers go to work, who will bring money out?

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.166
Let people raise money, don't give people time to go home and get it

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.766
Come on, Yiqiu

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.100
We don't have time to waste time with you here

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.300
Are you forcing me to leave in person?

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Mr. Xia

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.966
Mr. Xia, I want to buy that bond

18
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.300
100 bucks for bonds, right?

19
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.300
I'll register you.

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.700
OK

21
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.233
Take this, okay?

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.866
Look at this, isn't someone coming to buy it?

23
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.366
Just raised 100 bucks

24
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.966
I don't know, I thought I raised 1 million

25
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.300
Mr. Xia, we also want to buy that bond

26
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.166
I'll buy it for 200 bucks, I'll buy it for 500 bucks

27
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.566
I borrowed some money from a relative

28
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.900
I'll take 2,000.

29
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.233
Me, too.

30
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.733
I want to buy it too, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry

31
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.200
Yes, everyone has it

32
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.433
Everyone line up

33
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.766
Come here to register.

34
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.866
500500500500 Okay.

35
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.200
Tell me again

36
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.933
I didn't expect you to be so capable

37
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.466
How? How much?

38
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:39.600
Is there 200,000?

39
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.800
More than 200,000

40
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.366
What's 1 million?
