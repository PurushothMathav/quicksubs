1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.100
I don't agree with that.

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.066
This is Dianli.

3
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.266
Why don't you agree? I'm Mr. Xia's secretary

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.866
Your ridiculous decision

5
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.066
I just don't agree.

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.700
Mr. Xia said

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.166
Do what I tell you to do

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.866
If you don't listen

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.500
I don't mind asking you to do something else.

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.500
you

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.700
You rascal

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.733
Sister Shuang is here

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.833
How is it, cool sister?

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.966
A gift box made with a cool word in your name

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.100
Nice cover, right?

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:33.900
Not too bad.

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.533
Mr. Xia, look at his box of such things.

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.200
He actually sold it for 10 yuan

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.400
10 yuan is indeed a bit expensive.

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.700
Is there a difference between 9 yuan and not 10 yuan?

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.200
Just a dime away, of course there is a difference

22
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.466
This is psychology.

23
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.900
Although it is only a dime short

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.466
However, from the consumer's perspective

25
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.933
He just didn't hit double digits

26
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.266
It's cheaper than 10 yuan.

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.500
Take a look. Take a look.

28
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.633
Don't miss it when you pass by

29
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.000
No 990 no 99

30
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.266
Only 9 yuan 9

31
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.733
New Year's gift box to bring home

32
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.733
Look inside, look inside

33
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.666
9 yuan 9 can't buy it at a loss, foreign wine can't be fooled

34
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.800
Busy with your New Year, what you sold this month is too cheap.

35
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.900
Go together and roll in

36
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.700
I'll have a box.

37
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.400
It's almost Chinese New Year. How face-saving is this gift?

38
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.466
Get me two boxes.

39
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.000
Okay, two boxes.

40
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.133
Come here for bookkeeping, I'll have one too

41
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.966
Yes, please give me one.

42
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:22.900
I'll have some too

43
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.000
Take it well, thank you.

44
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.800
I want three boxes.

45
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.133
I want one too, I want too

46
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.233
Ok, here it is.

47
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.900
Ah, I'm sorry, everyone, today's stock is sold out.

48
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.800
Excuse me?

49
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.900
We will still be here tomorrow.

50
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.100
Sorry, sorry.

51
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.200
It's done, it's done

52
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.366
Sister Na, how is today's profit?

53
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.100
Are you becoming more and more confident in my ability to make money?

54
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.000
Also blow

55
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.966
If you can sell goods, you should bring a few more boxes.

56
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.400
I took two boxes and sold them so early.

57
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.833
How much less money do you make? You are wrong again.

58
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.500
This is called hunger marketing.

59
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.100
Hunger marketing
