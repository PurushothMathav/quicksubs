00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.333
dare not be

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.900
You are the senior when it comes to beating women.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.133
No matter what happened before

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.166
From Now On

5
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.100
I will protect my wife and children

6
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.600
Have you blocked your brain?

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.300
Or read too many short sentences?

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.666
The god of war is back

9
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.233
Second Transformation Husband

10
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.633
Do you believe your own wife when you say this?

11
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:19.800
I'll tell you what.

12
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.733
Get out of here

13
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.700
You're pushing your goddamn luck, aren't you?

14
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.900
If you dare to move the bed, try it.

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.600
Fucking bastard

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.800
You hit me?

17
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.633
Behind Lao Tzu is Chairperson Sun of Dingsheng Group

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.700
His old man eats black and white

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.266
If you hit me in the face, you are hitting Sun Dong in the face

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.800
Be careful of Chairperson Sun's anger

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.033
I don't know how you died, kid. Let me die

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:48.800
How do you know?

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.033
This time your backer will definitely help you

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.300
My backer doesn't help me help you?

25
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.433
Do you know what kind of friendship Sun Dong has with me?

26
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.366
Isn't it just money to kill him?

27
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.500
I'll give it to you, don't hurt me.

28
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.466
Why do you have a crush on this man?

29
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.133
Sure enough, you two sisters are of the same heart

30
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.366
All the men you like are the same

31
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:11.966
Will not

32
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.700
Your avant-garde has already served him, right?

33
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.900
How have you been?

34
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.100
Do you live well?

35
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.133
How are you feeling?

36
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.700
Hahaha shameless

37
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.200
Well said, I will be shameless today.

38
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.400
Come and cripple this kid

39
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.666
Then it was his turn

40
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:32.933
brother

41
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.466
Can you fight?

42
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.366
square

43
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.866
How dare you!
