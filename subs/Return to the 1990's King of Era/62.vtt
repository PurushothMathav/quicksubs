1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.233
To hold the glass

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.700
How about you don't understand stocks?

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.366
This new stock starts to rise and then falls

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.500
Husband is a loser

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.366
What the hell does he know?

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.866
What he really doesn't understand is you

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.100
Poor people like you still need to choose according to the skeleton

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.466
And I can actually place an order

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.933
Hahaha, what are you?

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.733
It's also priced, you can order one and I'll take a look.

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.233
Please eat frogs

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.000
Are you a radish and cabbage?

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400
They set their own prices.

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.600
Are you the one who invited the frog to eat?

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.500
OK

16
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:35.866
How much did you buy?

17
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.500
Bought 500 bucks

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.866
Hahahaha, it's so pitiful.

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.766
I bought it for 500 yuan.

20
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.700
This 500 won't be what I gave you last time, right?

21
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.200
If you really don't have money, tell me.

22
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.700
I'll give it to you, don't pay it back.

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.400
Just feed the dog

24
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.266
If you have more money, you can buy more stocks

25
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.666
How many stocks we buy has nothing to do with you

26
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.466
The bitch has already lost

27
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.566
See how I play you

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
1 million signal gun technology, please wait a moment

29
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.566
Please put away your stocks

30
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.866
Hey, you have a good body

31
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.366
Just order it.

32
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.266
husband

33
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.366
Your sauce-flavored technology has gone up 3 points since it opened.

34
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.633
How did you make 30,000?

35
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:36.000
No matter how cool it is, just wash it up and wait for me.
