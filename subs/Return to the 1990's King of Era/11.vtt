00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.600
What do you mean?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:01.966
Could it be that

3
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.600
However, the business between us must also be maintained

4
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.400
This project

5
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.166
What's the use of small profits with me?

6
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.700
What is this bad gambler capable of?

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.100
It's worth your help.

8
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.166
What ability

9
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.200
If it weren't for Mr. Yi's suggestion

10
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.600
I would have gone broke and jumped off a building

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.466
Understand? Go

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.600
Mr. Yi, thanks for your suggestion.

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.033
Saved my company

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.500
Saved my life

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.900
Please accept my worship.

16
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.033
What's going on?

17
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.800
Sun Dong doesn't have to be so generous

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.600
I'm just a simple sentence

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.700
It's really a simple sentence for you

20
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.066
But just this sentence

21
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.266
Saved my company nearly 1 billion of losses

22
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.566
Mr. Yi

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.133
This is a car I just bought

24
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.700
I'll give it to you as a transportation.

25
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.600
It's my heart too

26
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.900
Such a car can cost more than 200,000

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.800
Why did you give it to this gambler for nothing?

28
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.566
Mr. Sun, you don't misunderstand anything.

29
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.566
He's not just a bad gambler

30
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.200
It is worthy of such a great gift from you.

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
Do I need you to teach me how to do things?

32
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.966
Goodbye three days when you are impressed, don't you understand? Get out

33
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.000
OK

34
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.466
OK, I'll wait

35
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.233
Mr. Yi, please accept it immediately
