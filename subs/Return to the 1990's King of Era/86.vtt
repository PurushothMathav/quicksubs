00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.133
Let my mother teach you a good lesson

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.266
What's wrong with the villain?

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.600
Come on, get up.

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.200
What's wrong with him?

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.700
He thought badly about the bear toy my dad bought me

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:13.966
i

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.966
So I gave him a push.

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.566
It's okay, it's okay.

9
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.000
Make your son apologize

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:27.166
Hmph, so this little beast has a mother

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.400
Your daughter pushed my son first

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.366
If you want to apologize, you apologize

13
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.633
Are you being unreasonable?

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.066
It was your son who ripped my daughter's teddy bear.

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.333
Why should we apologize?

16
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.966
Yes, yes, I don't apologize, what?

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.500
Just a broken toy

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.166
Besides, what do you care about as an adult and a child?

19
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.166
How interesting are you?

20
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.766
What about you? Didn't you say you were going to hit my daughter?

21
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:48.966
How are you?

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.800
I'd love to. Can you handle it?

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.466
Anyway, your daughter pushed my son first.

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.966
I have to apologize to my son.

25
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.466
I hit him in the face.

26
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.366
I said it is indeed your son who should apologize to others

27
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.033
It's your son who steals other people's toys

28
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.666
Yeah, if the child makes a mistake

29
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.100
The child will be useless in the future

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.266
What does it have to do with you how my son is?

31
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.066
I would love to pay for the child

32
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.100
nosy

33
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.566
Do you apologize?

34
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.066
Life is about your son apologizing

35
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.500
Be stubborn, right?

36
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.900
I'd like to see if you have a hard mouth

37
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.400
Or I slap hard
