00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.200
What are you so proud of?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.900
It's only a piece of 5.

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.366
Even if I drop 10 points, I still make 100,000

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.500
That is.

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.166
You bought a total of 1,000 yuan of key glass.

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.666
Up 10 points

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.933
100 yuan at most

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.766
Don't worry.

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.366
Here we go.

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.400
Brother Xiaoqiang, you fell again

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.566
Down 10 points

12
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.466
I lost everything I made now

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.766
Oh, no.

14
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.766
I lost my pants.

15
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.200
This key bag has gone up to 20 yuan a share.

16
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.200
Hey, it's gone up again, it's gone up another 50 yuan.

17
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.900
50 bucks a share

18
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.466
How is that possible?

19
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:37.466
Can my husband really control the stock price?

20
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.300
Our sauce-flavored technology is already halfway there.

21
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.033
The old 1 million 500,000

22
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.066
Yiqiu, look at our medicinal glass.

23
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.866
It has risen to 70 yuan a share.

24
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.000
Yes, it sucks thick at a low price.

25
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.233
Pull the price

26
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.566
Sell them all when they are at the highest level.

27
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.100
We can make a big discount

28
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.866
It's called Zhuang

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400
Yiqiu, you are really amazing

30
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.966
Look, it's gone up to 100 bucks a share.

31
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.500
How much can you earn for 100 yuan?

32
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.766
5 cents a share

33
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.066
Turn it up 2,000 times.

34
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.233
We have a capital of 1,000 yuan.

35
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.000
Only made 2 million

36
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.133
One day

37
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.300
$1,000 becomes 2 million

38
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400
You are too powerful when you are poor
