00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.066
A billion. You know what a billion looks like?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.466
Let you pick it up now

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.700
You can't pick up a billion in such a short time

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.766
Bragging again.

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.866
That's right.

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.066
Who believes who is a fool

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.233
Hmph, I really don't know the sky and the earth

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.666
Do you know what a billion is?

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.766
Open your mouth and dare to say that you have made 1 billion

10
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.966
I don't understand what a billion is

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.233
Is it you?

12
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.366
Even if my best friend

13
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.600
Sun Hongyu, the first guardian of Jiangnan

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.133
After so many years of hard work

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.400
A merchant who only made 1 billion

16
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.066
You are a bad gambler

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.466
In such a short time

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.866
Can you make a billion dollars?

19
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.633
You said everyone here

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.366
Who is not a business person without legal person law?

21
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.466
Quietly you ask them

22
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.100
Do you think they believe it?

23
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.733
I don't believe a bad gambler can borrow me to pay it back

24
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:57.333
I don't believe a gambler can still be a business genius

25
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.200
I can't believe it. I've been working hard for more than 5 years

26
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.366
Get help from Mr. Sun

27
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.400
The net worth is just over 100 million

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.700
You've been in business for less than a month

29
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.333
Dare to say that you have 1 billion net worth

30
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.366
This is ridiculous.

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.700
He keeps saying that he has earned 1 billion

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.800
Who can testify?

33
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.266
I can testify

34
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.566
I can also testify

35
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.600
You both work together in two languages

36
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.700
Of course I will speak for Yiqiu

37
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.100
Humph

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.500
You slander my husband

39
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.700
I have a girlfriend

40
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.066
What happened when I hit you?

41
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.166
Dad, look at the three of them

42
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.600
All three of them hit me

43
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.466
You have to call the shots for me

44
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.100
outrageous

45
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.300
Somebody call the law enforcement team up

46
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.700
Take these three vulgar people to jail for me
