1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.700
Then I'm really unfair

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.400
Small gifts are no respect

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.533
It's nothing compared to your help to me.

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.666
I didn't expect you to not only raise bonds

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.600
You can even read a company's financial report

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.566
A problem that even Uncle Sun didn't see

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.700
You can see something I understand

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.266
There's more.

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.366
One ball!

10
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.533
You raise money internally by issuing bonds.

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.266
Funding can be temporarily relieved

12
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.533
But you still have 1.20 million in a month

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.266
Yeah, company liquidity needs 500,000

14
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.000
It takes 500,000 to treat Xiao An

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.566
This 1 million is gone

16
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.700
Yes, Mr. Xia

17
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.666
Our factory's net profit in a month is 30,000

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.900
How can I return the 1.20 million then?

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.533
I know you owe the factory money.

20
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.100
Let us Mr. Xia take on the debt for you

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.100
Regarding Mr. Xia's usual kindness to your wife

22
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.266
How dare you hurt him like this

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.500
You are such a wolf-hearted white-eyed wolf

24
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.800
It doesn't matter, as long as you can save the scene and Xiaoyan

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.566
Even if I do take on these debts

26
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.900
I would too

27
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.466
Don't worry

28
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.133
Mr. Yi has helped me so much

29
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.366
I'll lend you this 1.20 million

30
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.566
Whenever you want.

31
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
Mr. Sun doesn't need to borrow money

32
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100
I can earn this 1.20 million in five days
