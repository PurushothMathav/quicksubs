00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.100
This slap is for my mom

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.466
How dare you hit me?

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.566
Didn't you just stand here and say let me fight?

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.333
This this

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:13.900
This slap

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.033
I bought it for 10,000 bucks

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.800
you

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.366
You what you

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.933
Aren't you short of money?

10
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.200
Ah then I'll slap you again

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.433
10,000 yuan for you

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.900
Not Li Qiong

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.366
You are going too far.

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.766
After all, we are relatives

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.033
Why did you hit your second aunt so hard?

16
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.666
Now think about the mood

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.833
What did you do when you let him bully my mother?

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.900
You loach

19
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.366
You wait for me.

20
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.966
Is this the end?

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.900
Let my son come and take care of you later

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.600
Son, you treat your second aunt and second uncle like this.

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.200
Is it too much?

24
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.066
Mom, they are just bullying the soft and afraid of the hard.

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.333
I promise that no one will dare to bully you again

26
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.700
Son, you have grown up.

27
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.766
Can you talk?

28
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm going to cook

29
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.366
Alright Xiao Zhou

30
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.333
Go back to the company first

31
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.400
Okay, Mr. Xia will go

32
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.433
Why is my wife still unhappy?

33
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.600
You two

34
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.333
The food factory has such a big problem

35
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.633
Why didn't you tell me?

36
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.300
If I'm short of money, I can get it from the textile factory

37
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.366
Yeah.

38
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.666
Isn't the money problem solved now?

39
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.866
Photographer Xiaoyan, you don't know that loaches are amazing

40
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.300
$1,000 in the stock market 4 million

41
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.800
Now there's enough money to rebuild the food factory

42
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.266
I don't need to borrow money from you.

43
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.766
Ultimately

44
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.833
You still think I'm redundant
