00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:05.200
Tonight Tonight Tonight Tonight Tonight Tonight

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.566
Don't panic

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.500
Everyone be quiet

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.200
We must be real this time

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.866
Don't panic, what kind of Mr. Yi, Mr. Xia?

6
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.933
You've got the circle.

7
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.166
He's a scoundrel.

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.100
He smeared us as false propaganda, here it comes

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.633
Don't try to run today

10
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.666
Aren't you doing this lottery winning event?

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.633
Ah, 100 sets of cards are here.

12
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.566
Come and give me 100 cars

13
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.166
If you can't discount the car, you can.

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.500
20 million in total

15
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:40.133
One less point will sue you for defrauding consumers.

16
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.900
You're messing around.

17
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.666
It's simply impossible in such a short time

18
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.000
Collected 100 sets of kettle cards

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.800
How to default

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.900
OK

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.066
Is everyone listening?

22
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.566
What lottery winning activities did the food factory hold this summer?

23
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.566
It's not real.

24
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.800
Yes, I finally collected the cards.

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.133
Just leave it here and they won't cash it for me, right?

26
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.433
My mother said if you gather all the cards

27
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.900
They'll give it to you, right?

28
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.133
Do you not give redemption if you win the lottery?

29
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.266
Isn't that a scam?

30
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.500
Our children are looking for a change every day.

31
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.666
Just to get together

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.566
There are no prizes.

33
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.033
It's useless to put it all together

34
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.700
How dare you lie to us?

35
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.633
Refund money refund

36
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.200
A refund is a refund.

37
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.400
How much is it?

38
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:25.966
You cheat

39
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.533
What am I doing

40
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.500
Everyone be quiet

41
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.400
Everyone be quiet

42
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.600
stop stop stop

43
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:34.966
Stop

44
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.300
stop stop stop

45
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.966
Don't even think about it today

46
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.500
If you don't give me these 100 cars today

47
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.300
What about it?

48
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:45.200
It is difficult to prove the authenticity of your activity.

49
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.333
Of course I have a way

50
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.100
Can prove the authenticity of my activity

51
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.500
What can you prove?

52
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.700
Who can prove it to you? I can prove it to him.
