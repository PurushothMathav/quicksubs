00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.900
I think you two really don't want to live anymore, do you?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.300
That's because you two should wait

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.400
You're just waiting for the factory to go out of business

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.666
Start now.

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.266
Don't try to sell another pack of cigarettes

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.566
Don't even think about bringing another penny.

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.700
After all, Mr. Xia and you used to be husband and wife

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.666
Do you have to do things so badly?

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.966
Why are you afraid?

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.600
OK

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.600
Let them both come over and kneel and kowtow to me and apologize

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.200
I can forgive you.

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.833
You are wrong.

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.200
Now you should get on your knees and beg me

15
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.900
I just considered letting you live

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.766
Haha.

17
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.600
Are you out of your mind?

18
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.866
You dare to say anything

19
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.366
What do I need from you?

20
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.466
I sell gift boxes cheaper than you.

21
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.566
If you want money, I can send a bank loan at will.

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.400
You just got something to hang your stomach

23
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.366
Mouth marketing?

24
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.266
What else?

25
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.700
It's almost the end of the year

26
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.766
These gift boxes of yours are waiting to rot in the warehouse.

27
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.033
Frog in the Well

28
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.166
Sure I would.

29
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:59.466
If you can't imagine it, I'll see.

30
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.400
See what other means you have to make a comeback

31
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.633
Haha, it is.

32
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.766
You're just a snack seller after all

33
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.100
What will we do later?

34
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.966
But to participate

35
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.566
Jiangnan's top business exchange conference

36
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.966
Such a grand event!

37
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.266
Only people worth over a billion can participate

38
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.233
You low-level trash

39
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.500
Don't even think about going in for the rest of your life

40
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.300
Ah, Mr. Xia

41
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.966
So what do we do now?

42
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.366
Now we can only let the factory shut down first.

43
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.400
Stop in time

44
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.166
Then figure out a way not to stop work.

45
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.900
The problem now is that the gift box can't be sold.

46
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.133
If you don't stop the loss in time

47
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.333
The losses will get bigger and bigger

48
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.866
I have a way to sell

49
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.433
No matter how low Fang Yuan drops

50
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:44.866
Can't stop
