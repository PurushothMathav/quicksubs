00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.500
Hunger marketing has been based on rarity since ancient times

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.533
The less stuff there is, the louder it will be

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.933
The more people there are, the more popular they will be.

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.700
Wait until you have enough popularity

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.300
Let's release the goods again.

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.066
Then you can make a lot of money

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.533
This is called Hunger Ningxiang

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.533
Daydreaming

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.733
You tease people like this

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.533
A few days down

11
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.766
Surely no one will buy this shitty trip

12
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.466
Really? Don't complain.

13
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.666
Let's also make a bet

14
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.700
If you keep making people like this

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.300
Someone can still buy it in three days.

16
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.066
You can let me call you dad, okay?

17
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.066
We pull the hook

18
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.733
If no one buys it after three days

19
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.766
You have to disappear from us

20
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.100
So you don't snore.

21
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.033
No problem, just pull the hook

22
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.366
I want this

23
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.300
Give me a total

24
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.100
I want 5 boxes.

25
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.233
always me

26
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.400
I've been in line for three days

27
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.300
Today, I bought 10 boxes and washed them all while washing.

28
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.166
Hey, Mr. Yi is here

29
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:50.566
I also have a car

30
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.766
So many people bought it, how many did it sell today?

31
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:58.900
I sold 5 boxes today, it's 5 cars and 5 cars.
