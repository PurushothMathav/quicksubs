00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.266
How is this possible with so much money?

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.266
That's enough money to give you a few slaps

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.200
Does this have to be over a million?

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.866
How could this trash have so much money?

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.233
Ahahaha

6
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.500
I see.

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.733
You must have gambled the money

8
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.533
Where do you care where my money comes from?

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.766
The money is here

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.700
Are you qualified to delete you now?

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.966
Ouch, you bet

12
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:30.966
What are you looking like?

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.066
Sooner or later, you are not going to lose it back.

14
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.866
How much did you lose?

15
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.566
I won so little back

16
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.500
What are you so proud of?

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
You are short-sighted

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.866
ignorance

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.166
When will you still look at people with the same old eyes?

20
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.666
This money came from Yigu's ancient records in ancient times

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.866
That's not possible.

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.900
This trash can only gamble

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.633
How could he trade stocks?

24
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.166
Oops, I'm the general manager of Summer Foods.

25
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.366
Don't you believe what I said?

26
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.300
You are Xiaolian's best friend.

27
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.400
Who knows if you will cooperate with this autumn

28
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.466
Are you acting?

29
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.866
Mr. Xia, this money

30
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.866
It's the stock exchange

31
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.433
Dividend to Mr. Yi Qiu

32
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.133
This is -- this is in the millions.

33
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:31.933
Ah!

34
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.100
This is a gambler

35
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.666
Are you really rich?
