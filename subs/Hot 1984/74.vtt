00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.980
Jiang Yun, I’m going to tell you something.

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.070
Let's get it right. young

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.190
No need. Why?

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.100
People won't want you. You are a woman with a child,

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.200
Tomorrow will be stinky from now on.

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.680
Who dares to want you? yes

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.130
Jiang Yun: Be obedient. You will find good friends and family for you.

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.730
Be a good family member. Otherwise, I'll apologize and give you this outfit.

9
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.470
Jiang Yun, do you want to have this child?

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.840
I think. Then something was wrong.

11
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.160
Sisters are with you. Women no longer have men,

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.360
The same is possible. Not by men.

13
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.380
Who can rely on?

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.150
I'm doing the wrong business now

15
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.290
I'm in the city

16
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.310
There is no chance of pairing again

17
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.890
He said he needed to do some psychological dirty work

18
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.010
I want to give you 89 yuan more than my salary.

19
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.670
Let's talk about it if we need to get away from it

20
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.310
Give you a battlefield

21
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.910
It should be 9 yuan

22
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.160
This computer hasn't been turned on yet.

23
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.340
Let’s start to draw the pie.

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.980
Take a look at your broken mountain wheel for yourself

25
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.360
Give me something

26
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.260
Still want to turn on the power

27
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.800
Can I drive it?

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.740
No need to spare you any guilt

29
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.700
It costs money to give birth to a child

30
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.060
I'll be a dick for you

31
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.400
Since this is a woman

32
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.060
what are you doing what are you doing

33
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.680
Aren't you just afraid of other people's birth?

34
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.180
No matter if you have to marry me or not, do you want me to marry you?

35
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.700
Children’s future itinerary

36
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.840
I can relate to you in a way

37
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.840
But I can’t say it

38
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.300
I can look down on you

39
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.820
Since since a woman

40
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.800
Just leave it to me

41
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.990
Is the child okay? Let’s go for a walk or something.
