00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
He's stabilized, okay? Don't worry.

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.930
Gone. Let me help you choose to participate.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.880
Quickly complete the whole good lesson. Go, go, go, go.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.580
Suddenly he discovered these things.

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.130
Ten, go quickly. Quick, quick, quick.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.720
What do we want? Mom. Can you think about what to do?

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.450
no. Son, how did you get here?

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.490
When the coolies come.

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.710
Ah, no. Hello, uncle.

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.150
I said you chose the clothes and they really fit you.

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.570
Mom, let’s sit down first, sit down,

12
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.390
Sit, sit, sit.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.230
Dad thinks it’s pretty good here

14
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.860
We heard what you are thinking

15
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.260
What kind of uncle plan, what kind of quality-effect relationship?

16
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.860
All photography items

17
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.300
It’s not that I can’t think of any plans.

18
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.600
That's how you got through it so that the three of you can know

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.010
You are drinking big tea

20
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.570
I think agricultural products are pretty good

21
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.590
These are all due to the poor ties of the peasants’ mother country.

22
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
Yes dad

23
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.040
What we sell at Commercial Aviation are all imported products.

24
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.660
What electrical appliances, cosmetics?

25
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.220
But the consumer group is very long

26
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.240
In fact, there is a vast market

27
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.410
What do you know? There will be no more visits to the consumer hall.

28
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.320
You just sold a hundred catties of sweet potatoes

29
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.640
It's not worth it. Let's discuss selling a handful.

30
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.760
But tell me what I think

31
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.720
That hundred pounds of sweet potatoes

32
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.860
It’s the farmers who get the power and the consumers who get the benefits.

33
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.810
We made money again, so that's good, right?

34
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.230
It is more profitable to consume per pound. You make more money.
