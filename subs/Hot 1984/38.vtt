00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.060
What are you saying?

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.800
Why can you accept so many meal calendars?

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.600
He collects so many meal calendars? What does it have to do with you?

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.410
Will you still be the same as before?

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.970
How many fake layers and fake dogs follow the dogs?

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.110
Do you think you have no job now?

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:42.040
Are you still giving me food to raise here?

8
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.900
What's going on?

9
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.000
Talk bad about me?

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.710
By the way, wedding,

11
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.720
Am I going to be ugly?

12
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.680
I heard that we have a newbie in our double marriage,

13
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.680
I don't hesitate to have some people come over to discuss,

14
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.780
I have to prepare in advance.
