00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.440
Do you know who I am?

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.040
I donâ€™t care who you are too?

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.620
Two circles and you lose your temper.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.680
To fat.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.660
Right. What about you?

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.200
The old hen is on the roof, what do you think?

7
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.290
Don't mess with him. It's okay,

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.790
Don't be afraid. A pair of fat meat,

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.210
One-on-one. say,

10
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.840
Have you always had this problem? What about you?

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.240
I went out with the idea in my head,

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.470
You guys are scary. Right. say,

13
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.070
I should see how you were beaten to death today.

14
00:00:45.710 --> 00:01:03.520
Then go quickly.

15
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.900
It's okay, I said I would protect you,

16
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.540
You go into the car. Do you believe it? What are you looking at?

17
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.690
Your man beats you

18
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.890
I'll only give you male customers.

19
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.100
Go if you can

20
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.300
Pull it up later
