00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.980
Feel free to bully women

Or who said

9
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.730
A woman cannot beat a man

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.290
As soon as I tightened my grip, I waved it out.

11
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.210
Women's head strength and Dingzhen

12
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.940
It cannot be used as your own equipment

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:47.070
Our family?

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.120
I didn't want to destroy anyone's family

15
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.220
Just ask yourselves

16
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.820
Is your family really harmonious?

17
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.300
you to your wives

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.140
Is it really good?

19
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.320
What's wrong

20
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.810
They gave you sons and daughters

21
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.170
Take care of the housework for you

22
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.270
What did you get in exchange?

23
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.790
It's your beatings and scoldings

24
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.950
It's your disrespect

25
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.709
Really good

26
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.030
What is the meaning of marriage

27
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.700
It's two people supporting each other for a lifetime

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.160
Not supported by one party

29
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.050
Even if it is a shameful thing, I said

30
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.470
I will definitely change this village

31
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.050
So that you can all live a new life 4

32
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.790
You stand in front of me and protect me

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.460
Teach everyone how to protect themselves for free

36
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.820
Who of you is willing to learn?
