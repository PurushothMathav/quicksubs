00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
That's the next hundred generations after all. Um,

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.740
right. Then you crossed the ground, right?

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:16.030
Fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork.

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:24.920
Fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.920
Fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork.

Fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork fork.

7
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.050
The employee you dare to stand up to

8
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.100
Then I will still be three people.

9
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.450
Whose daughter-in-law is not like this? Itâ€™s just you

10
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.610
Are you here to be an uncle?

11
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.380
Even as daughter-in-law

12
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.420
We also have to respect each other.

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.720
you don't respect me

14
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.710
Why should I respect you?

15
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.940
If you really want to take action

16
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.230
Then don't blame me
