00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:13.850
Itâ€™s time to eat. What a drink last man.

2
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.430
This hill will give me a son from now on.

3
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.850
To have a son means not to have a son.

4
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.000
You come out.

5
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.080
You cannot give birth to a son by yourself. Do you also want to see,

6
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.240
The hill cannot be born. Who will give me a son?

7
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.880
I miss you so much. I would take only two women to have sons. You marry.

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.110
What do people like this say about my facial expressions?

9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.420
I tell you, you can't get married.

10
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.580
I have to protect myself from this suggestion.

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.600
Who? Not even me.

12
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.220
Am I the one you promised to run away?

13
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.900
When we look at the company, our family should be able to compare.

14
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.780
willing to think about

15
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.239
It's a list anyway

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.300
Even with the boat special

17
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.200
I want to do it many times and have real love. My husband meets you, Xiaoxian.

18
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.790
Do you dare to serve you well?

19
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.630
I've been happy

20
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.970
I just thought something was wrong with him, Li Chafen

21
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.560
You want a divorce

22
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.150
I'll do it for you

23
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.870
All this is fun

24
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.170
i will help you

25
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.590
Clean up well

26
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.780
Have that root
