00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.980
What? Did you just write down your name?

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.080
Can't give a bit. I've heard it all.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.400
Bad words are spread outside.

4
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.540
In fact, marriage is the best way. My sister has just crawled out of the dust of marriage.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.620
What? You have to buy it alive for me.

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.000
What are you talking about? Why should I buy you alive?

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.090
That's the first time. I never care about feelings.

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.340
It is better to love and control than to control others. I swear.

9
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.820
I won't let you suffer. I listen to whatever you say.

10
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.740
I'll give you whatever you want. Make money to support your family.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.780
Housework is all included.

12
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.920
Good. Sometimes it’s more, sometimes it’s not less, sometimes it’s tax.

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.840
Okay, then change that to make it stand smoothly

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:01:20.970
Really of course
