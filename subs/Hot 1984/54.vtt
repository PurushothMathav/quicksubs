00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.160
It seems that it is a big deal to bear one's fate.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.520
It seems to be based on commitment. I won't tell you until you can beat me.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.700
I'll say three. If you don't fight, I will take them away.

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.780
three. seem. You won't go to him. ah

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.720
It's so hot for you

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.240
I'm so hot that you changed it

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:35.860
If you two don't come with me, Goa

8
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.980
I'm going to pretend to sign Xiaobo

9
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.400

10
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.610
You won't make it easy for that sister-in-law

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.060
What's your name, sister?

12
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.810
But wear it tomorrow

13
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.380
Must be free tomorrow

14
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.330
Accompany me to find a child

15
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.880
Who will pick up your child?

16
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.870
Friends, you will grow up in that special session

17
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.560
What do children think?

18
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.890
You are out of September and you can’t do it either.

19
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.090

20
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.280
Let me swim

21
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.510
Master you

22
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.240
What are you going to do?

23
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.320
What happened to you?

24
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.480
You are so big and young

25
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.480
I still can’t remember that little girl

26
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.260
It’s also easier than I wish

27
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.820
Who will bully her?

28
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.280

29
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.040

30
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.800

31
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.370
No, I want to have children now

32
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.330
It was her own fault, you see?
