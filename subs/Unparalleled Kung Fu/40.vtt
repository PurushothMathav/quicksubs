00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.600
It's a pity that once Wu Shen

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.566
Finally hidden in a place that lies in my hands

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.133
But Dongying needs more insurance

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.400
You are not him

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.166
Dongying will not be known to the whole world

6
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.700
I also advise you

7
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.666
Affectionate I must be autistic

8
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.833
Miss Ou, the winner is king

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.066
If you win, I'll preach again

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.166
Young Master, this time Miss Mu fought against Zeus

11
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.033
How many games do you have?

12
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.600
Is this Zeus so powerful?

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.366
Although Zeus was a reformer

14
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.866
But he united the world.

15
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.766
The tricks of millions of martial arts masters

16
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.366
Continuous reinforcement learning and self-training

17
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.666
Millions

18
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:54.966
This is not equivalent to

19
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.800
Is Miss Mu playing against Master Million?

20
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.500
Although it has been four years

21
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.166
The Dongying team's suicide attempt continues to strengthen

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.833
Its body shape and proportions

23
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.133
Close to perfection

24
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.900
There's no resistance.

25
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.900
It's not worth being twice as happy as the average person

26
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.800
But most importantly

27
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.066
He's a cold, heartless reformer

28
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.700
Hardly any emotion can affect him

29
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.166
In a sense

30
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.833
He is basically equal to

31
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.600
No matter how I fight

32
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.000
Zeus

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.366
You can find the corresponding move from the database

34
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.600
recruit and

35
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.766
Doesn't give me any time to think at all
