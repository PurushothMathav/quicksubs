00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.866
You said you belong to a big girl's family.

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.300
Why are you drinking and making trouble on the street?

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.200
Fortunately, I arrived in time.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.866
Otherwise, you won't be able to guarantee it in your heart

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.900
I'm not a ghost now

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.066
Might as well be dead

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.200
Last time you played against a reformer

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.266
We all saw it.

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.266
And everybody thought it was fantastic.

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.633
You shouldn't have given up on yourself.

11
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.900
The news that I joined Dongying

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.033
The whole building knows

13
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.300
Uncle, you know it too

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.566
I know, Uncle

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.633
You are also a disciple of the apocalypse

16
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.066
Do you also think that I was killed by the ancestors of the Mu family?

17
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.533
It's embarrassing. Back then, Shenwu Dao came to smash the scene

18
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.100
You took the initiative

19
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.900
Helped me keep the whole book

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.900
I remember what you said at that time now

21
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.766
Make me a big fool

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.400
Time respect

23
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.000
Not in my heart

24
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.500
I have difficulties in my heart

25
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.966
Thank you uncle

26
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.166
I didn't expect you to be the only one standing at the train station

27
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.900
Dongying Zuo has no end

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.266
Many crimes were committed in my building

29
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.600
I want to kill but I can't resist

30
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.400
And I said, "Okay.

31
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.533
How can I help you?

32
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.600
As I command

33
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.033
It's my business.

34
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.566
I don't want to involve more innocent people

35
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.966
Do you want to play the black circle for a lifetime?

36
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.200
People like me

37
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.866
Maybe dying in the ring is the best way to end up

38
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.300
If I say

39
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.233
I have a chance to move your way
