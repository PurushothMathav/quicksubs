1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.166
I'll tell you what!

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.866
The karate master of Dongyin

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.366
Pine Party has heard

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.100
Come to our club

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.066
That's arrogant

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.966
Let our curator come forward

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.800
Otherwise, this martial arts hall will be smashed

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.066
And?

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.300
Then your eldest brother and I go up and it's a ladder

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.433
That's loose.

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.466
Kneel down for me on the spot

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.000
Kneel down and beg for mercy

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.466
Brother, you are amazing

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.200
That's for sure.

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.500
I am the Qing Dynasty disciple of the master of the museum

16
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.066
The owner also gave me one or two pointers at that time

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.833
It's easy to deal with a few Dongying people, okay?

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
baga

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.566
Is this the first martial arts hall of the building?

20
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.633
It's Dongying people kicking the hall again, right?

21
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.266
Misunderstanding

22
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.666
I'm here to give you

23
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.066
Dongying people just don't have a long memory and dare to kick the hall

24
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.800
Are you guys okay?

25
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.700
Hey, pay attention.

26
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.966
Is he here to deliver the police iron?

27
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.433
You have no martial arts ethics

28
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:11.966
Excuse me?

29
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.100
I'm sorry to ask my apprentice to make up for your medical expenses.

30
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.166
Don't run
