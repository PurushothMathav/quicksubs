00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.933
Why are you here?

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.800
Hum, I know.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.200
I am not a weak person.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.300
If you still want to marry me, don't leave me.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.133
Take you with you but

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.600
How do you know?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.033
I told Mary.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:20.300
"Who told you to take me away?"

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.900
Don't worry, I've got it all sorted out.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.233
I told uncle Truong already.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.500
You can not give me a picture of my brother Huc.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.033
He taught me many times.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:29.600
Give me a chance to repay you.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.400
So...

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:34.800
You and I came to protect Rain Dream.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.666
But if something else happens in between

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.433
Then I don't know.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.466
Ms. Ton Nam.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.833
Just kidding.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:47.566
Knowing A Xu, if they want to go, let them go.

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.400
I, Tham Huyen Huyen, am not a stingy person.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.466
By then they just don't complain.

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.600
But let's take care of them together.
