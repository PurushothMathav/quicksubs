00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.066
These must be three evil spirits.

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.966
What's wrong? This disease is getting worse.

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.866
I just saw some poison on the zombie.

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.100
Isn't this fortune telling?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.966
Take your time.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.333
Zombie, get to save.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.800
You have the way.

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.666
This.

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.600
Hospital phone

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.766
Really?

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.666
Elder Qin's brother

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.100
We got to the hospital first, science was on time.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.066
Hello, is this the parents' room?

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.233
Who are you?

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.333
Why ask this?

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.700
We are here to talk about this.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.533
Nonsense, the person on the river was clearly dead.

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.966
What else do you need to do, you can't say clearly.

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.900
Too late.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.600
let me go

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.266
Don't you see we came here to beat people?

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.900
You guys are not rolling.
