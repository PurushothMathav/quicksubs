00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.633
Ton Nam threw the tail behind me.

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:07.400
So many people fighting for the sea miles?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.366
Here the sea is also the dragon head of the Alliance.

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.266
Book now

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.100
He is also a resource that many nobles fight over.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.700
Is this the almighty mile marker from that year?

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.066
Can he still wake up?

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.466
He must really not want to.

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.433
And in pain.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.766
Humans have blocked the brain channels.

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.233
So for several years he still has not had the ability to awaken.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:33.400
What now?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.166
I opened all his channels.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.566
But can he?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.400
Depends on how strong the desire to live is.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.733
Ly Thanh Hai, Ly Thanh Hai.

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.333
The person closest to him betrayed him.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.800
Your heart and dreams will be destroyed too.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.666
Once you sleep for so many years

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.866
Should she get up?

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.466
Let those who deserve be punished.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.866
Useful September

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.433
Ly Thanh Hai, Ly Thanh Hai.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:53.933
Think about your daughter.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.166
Brutally murdered at such a young age.

00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.266
You should stand up like a man.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.566
Don't you want revenge?
