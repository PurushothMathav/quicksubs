00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.866
Okay, you are Tan Duc Vuong.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.533
Dare to rob people in front of me.

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.533
Zhang Yilong came to my hospital.

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.633
I will treat you best.

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:08.900
Thanks Jiro.

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.700
Just now I plan to rebuild the red Chinese medicine room.

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.800
Maybe there is no energy to worry so much.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.133
No problem. Come here for advice.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.200
Optional conditions.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.600
Hey, what's wrong, old man?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.400
Who let you not know how to improvise?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.466
You still have a point.

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.600
When we discuss

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.766
You didn't say that.

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.633
You always argue with me.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.033
Does the fight make any sense?

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.100
You are the one who dug the wall first.

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.766
Xuan Xuan, Tan Lao and who?

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.766
The two of them are like that, no need to care about them.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.033
So it seems their relationship is very good.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.333
Our feelings are not normal either.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.133
OH.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.733
Why is this an unusual law?

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.333
That's unusual.
