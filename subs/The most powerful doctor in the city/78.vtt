00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.600
Vu Nhu, what are you doing?

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:06.233
Mr. Wook, don't you want to cure my cold?

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:06.766
I'm home.

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.166
I saw you turned off all the lights, I thought you were asleep.

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.166
So get up.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.033
How does it feel hot?

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.733
Mr. Wook, I feel so cold.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.266
You persevere a little, wait until school ends and it won't be cold anymore.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.166
Yes.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.766
Mr. Wook, where are you going?

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.666
I have important work to do.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.500
I will not be back for the time being.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.933
I want to go too.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.933
Good travel

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.833
You stay home and take care of my dad.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:46.033
Moreover, once the clinic opens, you cannot leave your side.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.966
Just a little hard work, we have a little rain.

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.933
Wait for me to come back to buy you a gift.

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.200
Okay, let's go.
