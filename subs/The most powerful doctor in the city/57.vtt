00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.833
How was it? Good job.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:07.666
Pretty.

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.166
But I still think my A Huc is better.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.466
It is possible to make the dead start talking anyway.

00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.266
Xue Zhiqian

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.966
Please learn to keep a low profile, you are so good I can lose money.

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.066
Nowhere to be seen.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.466
If you don't see it, go away.

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.833
Okay, fairy.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.466
So I'm not worth it anymore?

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.066
I know you, why are you so polite?

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.933
Doesn't it look strange?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.500
Hey grandpa.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.000
sir, what's wrong

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.733
You are asking your question too.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.866
I have to go back. I'll go with you.

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:45.566
Yeon-yeon, what the hell?

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.000
Now we found some on the construction site.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.333
Suspected ancient cultural relics

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.200
Now the construction project is suspended, how can this be?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.066
Someone must have done it.
