00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.200
Mr. Wook.

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.866
Are you dressed like this today because you want to go on a date?

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.266
Yes, today I went with Mary to choose a gift for grandpa.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.333
Mr. Wook, you won't be here tonight.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.566
No turning back.

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.500
What are you thinking?

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.466
Gone.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.900
This is Thien Nhat Cac.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.866
The greatest treasure of Yen Kinh city

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.500
Inside there are many rare treasures.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.466
So today is to choose a gift for grandpa.

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.166
Send it to him as a congratulatory gift from him

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.200
as junior

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.866
I also gave grandpa a gift.

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.800
YES.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.666
Just choose.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.666
I will pay.

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.666
There is no reason for a girl to pay.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.033
Don't forget, I'm a super member.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.900
So the gift here I can choose 3 for free.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.966
No matter how much it is worth, I can take it.

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.900
So this does not count as me coming to pay.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.466
Then I have to choose a good one.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.000
Alright.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.533
Why is he here?

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.500
Could it be that he hasn't absorbed those two bones yet?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.766
What a shame.
