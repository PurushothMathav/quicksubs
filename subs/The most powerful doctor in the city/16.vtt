Older brother

00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.033
Will you marry me?

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.966
Miss Wang, please respect your father.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.833
Miss Wang, the scar on your face has been removed.

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:12.433
With his looks and background.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.566
Will find a better husband soon.

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.000
Great, Ms. Vuong.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.633
Congratulations on restoring your appearance.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.733
But Truong Huc Dong, he is my boyfriend.

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.633
I don't mind dreaming with my sister.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.233
Jiu Jia, that love is good.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:27.666
We will report first.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.566
Thank you for saving Tieu Ly.

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.833
If you have anything in the future, just come find me.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.166
Vuong Mo must go first.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.266
Stole through the Nine Houses.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.233
Sorry.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.933
I just don't want to marry Trieu Van Kiet.

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.933
I didn't expect it to cause you so much trouble.

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.266
no thanks

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.166
I was able to meet a great person like Vuong Cuu.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.433
More than knowing

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.633
Are you going to be someone's son-in-law?

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:50.466
Mr. Wook.

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.733
Miss Wang is due to her childish temperament.

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.066
So...

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.200
What kind of girl is that?
