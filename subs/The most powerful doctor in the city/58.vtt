00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.200
Someone must have done it.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.666
I am always on site.

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.966
If someone does something, I won't know.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.700
Are you sure you are always at the construction site?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.433
Of course.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.666
There is no reason to add a few cultural relics

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.100
There must be someone involved.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.866
I have followed the old man for so long.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.766
Doubt me.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.733
Don't get so worked up.

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.333
I don't know, I thought you did something wrong.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.133
Who are you?

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.333
Is there somewhere to talk here? He is my friend.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.100
His word is my word.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.966
If you all doubt me I give up.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.700
Stop! Who gave you permission to go?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.733
What do you want?

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.033
Does that thing around your neck feel uncomfortable?

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:33.733
I don't understand what you are saying.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.900
Die in the end still have a hard mouth

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.233
You can bear the pain of daily concentration for a few more days.

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:38.866
You better tell the truth.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.866
Maybe I can still save you.

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:41.900
What's up?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.133
Even if you don't say it.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.866
We can also find instructions behind.

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.533
Your life is no longer ours for the time being.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.700
Hurry up and tell me the old man is Trieu Thien Hung.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.133
He threatened me with poison.

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.333
He said if I didn't help, he would die.
