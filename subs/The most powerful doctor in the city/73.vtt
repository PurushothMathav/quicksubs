00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.533
Oh, my eyes.

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.033
My eyes.

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.500
Mr. Wook, are you okay?

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.133
No, this must be dealt with.

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.166
I will go see the doctor.

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:23.666
Come with me first, don't worry about the rainy dream.

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.566
I didn't expect you to still carry these things.

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.033
I am a killer.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.033
Regular meals are often injured.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.166
No first aid kit.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.133
I don't know where I will die.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.533
Same.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.766
Why did you save Van Mong?

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.533
What?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.666
You must also rely on the power of Yen Kinh city.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.066
Who wouldn't want that?

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.766
So you and Cuu Gia are in a competitive relationship.

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.100
If you don't save Van Mong

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.033
With the level of the Nine Families loving the rain and dreams

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.966
Will definitely be heavily affected.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:57.866
Until then.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.266
Aren't you lacking a strong organization?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.966
The husband does something, does nothing.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.566
As long as I have the ability to save him.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.666
It won't be really fun to be innocently lucky.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.700
Live one more day with you

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:10.433
Technology is not bad right?

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.966
Sasden, stop arguing with me.
