00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.366
I will go home and tell my grandfather about the break-up.

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.300
He knows.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.500
It will be fun for sure.

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.266
Yes?

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.700
Of course.

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.000
It's just that I have too many books now.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.666
I can't protect you yet.

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:18.466
But I'm afraid you'll be taken away by someone else.

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.200
Don't worry, I'm yours.

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.666
So Giang father and son are both in trouble.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.666
That's awesome.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.966
Come here and have another drink.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.700
Oh my god.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.033
This just got out of the hospital why is he drinking?

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:48.666
Oh, the hospital made me choke up.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.700
Come here and drink.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.900
Old Zhang, you raised such a good son.

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.666
There will be green smoke in the ancestors' graves, right?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.933
My son is the greatest pride of my life.

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:03.233
Ha ha ha, the ancestral grave is not just emitting green smoke.

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:05.233
The ancestors all wanted to run out.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.600
Mr. Wook, why are you home so late?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.866
Yes, dealing with a little personal matter.

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.533
Hey, old summer, old summer, old summer.
