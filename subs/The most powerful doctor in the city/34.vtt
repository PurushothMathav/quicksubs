00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.366
Right?

00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.933
I heard dogs barking before entering the door.

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.233
What a shame.

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.466
This is the treasure trove area.

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.500
Today, it all depends on you.

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.933
Based on it, does it know how to evaluate treasure?

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.400
Why is this dog following?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.166
Meet people then bite you.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.200
Okay, with guts, today we will compare shoulders.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.566
Okay, so you and I are here in the treasure appraisal area.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.866
Randomly select two treasures

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.433
High price wins

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.766
How?

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.133
If I lose...

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.600
Items in this treasure chest area you choose one.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.900
Young master pays

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.100
I lost to another person.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.166
The young master does not lack money.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.866
If you lose

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.766
Be good and disappear from Mary's side.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.100
In that case

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.833
I will add one more group.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.300
Do you dare to bet?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.566
What bet if A Xu loses?

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.966
I will marry you.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.800
So if you lose...

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800
What about our engagement?
