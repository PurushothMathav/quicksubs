00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.633
What happened so suddenly?

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:06.166
Didn't you help Wang Jiu save Li Chenghai?

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.966
Now it is proven that the great nobles all hate you.

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.233
A strange thing also happened in my hospital.

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:13.800
The next bodyguard jumped to his death.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.833
After being rescued, there was not a single wound on the body.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.500
Now the media is all propaganda.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.900
You borrowed our Tham family's hand.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.900
Fake festival

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.266
Threat.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.900
It seems like there is someone behind him.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.166
Honestly, if I'm right

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.300
This must be some kind of evil magic that can control people's hearts.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.666
But the person behind is very simple.

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.666
Art is cruel

00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.600
That's evil.

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.666
Is Ly Than still there?

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.800
Ms. Van, you're here.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.766
What's the big deal, Mary, why are you in such a hurry to find me?

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.600
Ms. Van, have you ever heard the dead talk?
