00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.533
I look familiar.

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.233
I am Vuong Chinh Vinh.

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.866
From the royal capital

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.566
That is the Royal Family that owns the Red Sun Alliance.

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:11.233
why did you save me

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:13.933
Because I want you to help me become British.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.133
Why does a powerful mother-in-law help you?

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.500
I can help you get revenge.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.700
This time I went to Yen Kinh.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.366
Bring a red sun alliance mouthpiece.

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.633
I can also help you return to the capital.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.233
Okay, I promise.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.466
Wang Zhenrong is hidden deep enough.

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.066
The name of the Red Sun Alliance alone could make Sergeant Yan

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.266
Once a king

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.866
I'm still careful with criminals after this.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.500
So now the patient is awake.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.733
Then goodbye first.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.866
Thanks a lot.

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.566
Yogurt give me some.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.133
Ms. Ton.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.366
How many killers are there in the red meat alliance?

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.766
Not many, you are just hundreds of people.

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.066
Number 100 is not much.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.633
So red meat alliance, you made me a mouthful.

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.300
Please, I will tell you.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.066
If you don't say anything, then don't say it.
