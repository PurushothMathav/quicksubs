00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.566
Why are you pulling my seals?

2
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.933
Hey, what's going on over there?

3
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.033
An outdated female star, I can pull it if I want

4
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.100
Isn't that an expired gift for a female star?

5
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.300
Hey, you are so shameless

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.333
You are so shameless

7
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.500
So shameless

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.666
Hurry up, hurry up

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.200
Hello, when will the liquidated damages go?

10
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.233
If we don't see the money again, we're going to sue you.

11
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.766
What's the matter, Miss?

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.066
Why? Why is there suddenly nothing left?

13
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.000
Character is drawn

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.133
No endorsements

15
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.300
Now you even have to pay a large amount of liquidated damages

16
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.466
Is it because I didn't win an award?

17
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.700
How could it be so sudden?

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.866
Could it be that Xue Zhilong did it?

19
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.533
Didn't he keep saying that without him there would be no Golden Dragon Award?

20
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.066
How dare he screw it up in public

21
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.266
The Golden Dragon Award has nothing to do with him

22
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.166
Yes, Xue Zhilong

23
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.566
I didn't expect the power behind him to be so powerful

24
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.466
Is it really like he said

25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.400
He gave me all this.

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.366
Xue Zhilong, you treat me like this

27
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:24.033
Wang Tianwang Tianwang Tianwang, hug me, get out of here
