00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.666
What a coincidence

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.100
He asked me to be there in a minute.

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.600
And I did.

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.000
Yeah, I said this kid is pretending

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.166
Now that Mr. Gong is here, let's see what else he has to say

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.966
Mr. Gong, I was just about to take care of this kid

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.766
Make the top happy

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.766
But I thought of you.

9
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.266
Leave this opportunity to you

10
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.000
He even prepared such a great gift for me

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:19.866
Yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.166
Since you are here, Mr. Gong

13
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.333
Such a great opportunity

14
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.366
Of course, I'll leave it to you, Mr. Gong.

15
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.600
See you are incapable

16
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.600
Will be slapped by a takeout delivery person

17
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600
That it is

18
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.400
Today is Mundy's awards ceremony

19
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.200
Otherwise, I would have cleaned him up long ago. Yeah, yeah.

20
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.566
Since you are here, Mr. Gong

21
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.200
Our four major families are also there

22
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.166
Don't let this kid spoil the nature

23
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.566
As long as Mr. Gong speaks

24
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.466
Let's make him famous now

25
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.333
Never enter the building

26
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.666
Not too light

27
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.600
I'm going to make him disappear forever

28
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.400
Do you know what you are doing?

29
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.666
Does Mr. Gong know who is sitting in the seat?

30
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.900
What's the matter, Mr. Gong?

31
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.366
How could it be because of him?

32
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.200
Did the luggage just say something?

33
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.200
Out of Mr. Gong's anti-aging
