00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.466
Baby

2
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.866
Our family Mendy from

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.700
Came back last night and that's it

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.100
I get dizzy every now and then

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.566
It must have been scared yesterday.

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.166
We sat all night without much sleep.

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.600
The little doctor comes in

8
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.766
It's actually a minor illness

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.800
But look at him

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.966
I definitely can't go out today.

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.900
Mr. Qilong, there is nothing wrong with his health

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.066
Very healthy.

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.633
Let's go out.

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.466
Where is the bodyguard

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.600
Put him in the car

16
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.666
Auntie, don't touch me

17
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.000
I can walk by myself

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.200
Oh, what a disappointment.

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.400
You just left?

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.033
Don't you say you want to support me and I will support you?

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.366
late

22
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.733
Do you really have no feelings for me at all?

23
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.566
What are these five years?

24
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.066
If you really forsake me

25
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.100
Our Lin family is over

26
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.666
It's not that I didn't give you a chance.

27
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.066
Do you cherish Xue Zhilong?

28
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.700
I was wrong. I will never do this again.

29
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.566
Don't leave me

30
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.666
It will be late whatever you say in the future.

31
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.100
From now on, we will return to the bridge

32
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.233
The way back is no longer relevant

33
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.700
No, you can't just abandon me. Let go
