1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.100
From start to finish

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.366
I never said no to you.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.866
And I told you

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.566
It's only the second time I've met Miss Yue

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.900
We are upright and clean

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.500
But you said so

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.400
What a man with a heart, everything is dirty

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.533
We just got divorced.

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.733
You went to the Jinlongjiang wine party to pester me

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.566
Still confused with this woman

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.566
Now they even hit people.

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.466
You made a scene like this at the venue

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.566
If not for you

14
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.300
Now the awards start early

15
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.900
This has nothing to do with Mr. Long

16
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.733
Miss Yue, this is my home

17
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.800
Thanks for your review.

18
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.433
But I hope you still handle it.

19
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.700
I understand, I hope you can be pure.

20
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.166
Thanks for understanding.

21
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.966
Lin Mengdi has always been me helping you

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.900
You wouldn't be where you are today without me

23
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.300
Please help me

24
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.933
So many years

25
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.666
Our Lin family has always been supporting you.

26
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.000
What do you do with your takeout money?

27
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.866
It seems I'm really blind

28
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.066
I just want to give you a gift tonight.

29
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.433
You really can't tell right from wrong

30
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.900
Also gave me a gift

31
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.366
Your gift to me

32
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.400
Is to make the venue like this

33
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.466
You are a man living off a woman

34
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.766
Asked out by our neighbor

35
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.466
Help another rich woman in a blink of an eye

36
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.466
Aren't you ashamed?

37
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.433
You think your neighbor doesn't have me?

38
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.133
Can you make it to today?

39
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.266
I even gave you your identity

40
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.066
You say I rely on who the woman is relying on who

41
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.566
Don't reverse the order.

42
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.933
What are you?

43
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.866
If it weren't for my grandmother

44
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.766
There's no way I'll marry you
