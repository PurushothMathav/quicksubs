1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.666
Are you mistaken?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Hyatt Group

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.666
How dare you speak nonsense here

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.800
I'm not mistaken.

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.200
I have my own way

6
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:12.300
You know, there's a lot of money in this room.

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.566
A technical genius.

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.166
More Management MBA

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.200
A problem that so many great people can't solve

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.600
Just you, the stinky delivery guy

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.000
You can't solve it

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.900
It's your incompetence

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.100
What a big breath

14
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.000
Where did the madman come from?

15
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.900
kick out

16
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.766
Wait, Mr. Yue

17
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.366
People at the bottom of society like him

18
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.166
There will be no such knowledge and vision

19
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.933
You seem confident.

20
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.100
Anyway, the so-called elites under you can't help it.

21
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.566
You're just waiting for the oath to evaporate

22
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.800
Why not give it a try?

23
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.200
And you must want to know what method I use

24
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.233
Then say it.

25
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.400
Drop your group's balance project

26
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.733
Dedicated to light projects

27
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:53.066
What Mr. Yue, this is too second-hand insurance

28
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.300
Enough is enough to sit still

29
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.600
Why don't we take the initiative

30
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.600
As long as I can save my menstrual efforts

31
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.866
I'm willing to give it a go
