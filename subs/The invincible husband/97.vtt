00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.566
Who did I think it was?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.500
The president of a small company

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.700
Dare to come to Genting Group to bark

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.700
I have children with him

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.966
It's not my man, is it yours?

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.266
I'm not as unscrupulous as you

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.566
And it doesn't matter who he belongs to

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.333
But a mere top student at MIT

9
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.366
No matter how hard you try, you are only worthy of rolling at the bottom

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.866
What about the security guard? How did you let such a person in?

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.933
Shangjin, the sixth lady of the Jin family, right?

12
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.566
Although born rich

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.866
But she is also a brainless and unruly princess

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.466
Everything you use is given to you with gold

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.266
Why are you arguing with me here?

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.000
Kim's good show comes and goes.

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.333
The two men just fought for

18
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.133
Excellent disciple of the Dragon Army

19
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.166
fight kill

20
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.533
Now the two women are taunting each other for the Dragon Army

21
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.766
Wonderful

22
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.700
You two stop arguing and shut up

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.066
Anyway.

24
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.600
I hurt the golden armor

25
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.900
It's been said throughout the summer

26
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.400
What are you?

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.933
Dare to rob me of a man

28
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:04.166
Then I'll let you know who I am

29
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.666
Miss is not good

30
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.866
Our Jin family was acquired by Yueshi Group

31
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.466
What!

32
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.666
How could this be?

33
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.666
Do you know who I am now?
