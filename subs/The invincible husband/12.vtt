1
00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:04.000
The Golden Dragon Award is up to you

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Stupid people dream beyond their means

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.700
200 million sign it

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.700
Leave my life today

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.866
Our marriage can be measured by money

6
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.700
If you want more, you can just say it

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.500
I will try my best to satisfy you.

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, you still don't get it.

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.566
Financial power

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.333
Is that so important in your eyes?

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.900
It's you who don't understand

12
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:26.800
You never know.

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.566
How big is the gap between us?

14
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.633
The identities between us are one heaven and one earth

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.866
What about my care for you in the past four years?

16
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.833
take care of

17
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.066
You mean you were outside delivering takeout?

18
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.233
Go home to cook and wash clothes called care

19
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.266
You really know how to eat soft and hard

20
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.000
Obviously, my Lin family has been sheltering

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.533
Protect you, a lost dog

22
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.533
Lin Mengdi, you yo yo yo

23
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.466
He's in a hurry to jump over the wall

24
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:52.333
It's really a lost dog

25
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.233
Ha ha.

26
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.133
Xue Zhilong, no matter what you say, it doesn't make sense

27
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.400
What I want

28
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.600
It was never your calling

29
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.166
What I want

30
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.333
You can't afford it.

31
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.200
How do you know I can't afford it?

32
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.633
Have you ever considered

33
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.466
I gave you everything you got in the past four years

34
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.500
You also said such shameless words

35
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.700
You are unreasonable

36
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.766
Xue Zhilong

37
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.933
Stop putting gold on your face, okay?

38
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:18.800
You

39
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.066
It's the one who is holding on to our lady

40
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.466
Wimp

41
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.800
Status determines vision

42
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.966
And you have nothing

43
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.266
Monty, the last time we dated

44
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.833
The necklace you tried on

45
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.300
30 million bought it

46
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.900
A mere 30 million

47
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.566
Let your Lin Mengdi's soul be bought
