00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.633
Hit me, you kill me

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.200
It's my fault

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.266
Too playful when young

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.200
Ignoring your child's feelings

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.666
But I've been trying

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.400
Give you the best life

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.933
When you came home pregnant

8
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.466
I'm so angry too

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.966
But I know you're my own flesh and blood.

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.600
No matter when

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.500
Only family is the last port

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.833
Qixi Festival, right?

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.333
It's too late for you to say anything now

14
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.500
The same goes for ingots.

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.466
The support you need most when you grow up is also your family

16
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.533
If he knew who his father was

17
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.366
You can also lighten some of the burden

18
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.266
I grew up without a mother either

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.966
Am I not living well?

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.166
Besides, I can give him the life he wants

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.466
No one else is needed.

22
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.966
You became like this today

23
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.833
Don't you feel the warmth of family?

24
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.400
You want the ingot to grow

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.600
Is there a lack of love too?

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.666
Don't worry.

27
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.466
No matter what this man is

28
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.066
Even for junk pickers

29
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.166
We accept all the gold awards.

30
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.433
In your eyes

31
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.700
Is my taste that bad?

32
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.333
I didn't mean that either.

33
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.433
Look at Yuanbao playing games outside by himself

34
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.833
If he had a father

35
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.933
Don't you still lighten the burden?

36
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.866
Daddy Daddy I Want Daddy

37
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.966
Play ingots until the age of 5

38
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.700
Let your aunt take you upstairs to rest
