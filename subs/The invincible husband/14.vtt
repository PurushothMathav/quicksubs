00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.833
Mr. Gong, this is your new factory

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.900
Only the top families have spouses

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.533
Birds don't smell, okay?

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.500
Don't you think I'm old and confused?

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.566
This is what you drank in Genting Tiangong

6
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.500
That's a difference between clouds and mud

7
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.900
If you don't mind

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.333
Take it back as a tree to replenish water

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.000
You don't have to say anything.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.600
I heard that the Dragon Army will sacrifice their lives at the Golden Dragon Drink Party

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.966
I don't know if it's true or not.

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.500
Trail of the Dragon

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.100
How can you and other commoners speculate?

14
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.000
There is no disrespect in the subordinates

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.733
Just our experts

16
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.033
Only keep Qingyun Longjun for decades

17
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.600
I hope Mr. will take it home and see you.

18
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:48.000
My family is willing to follow Qingyun Longjun with the Banshu Mountain family

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.700
Dad, are you getting old and confused? Shut up.

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.966
Let's see how you do.

21
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.966
Don't let the Dragon Army down

22
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.966
Congratulations to Mr. Gong

23
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.766
Hey, oops.

24
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.400
Dad, aren't we experts doing well?

25
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.300
Why use half of your wealth to follow Yunjun?

26
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.333
Broken corpse

27
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.566
Humph you ascension entertainment

28
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.700
It's just a few actors

29
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.866
We experts want to turn over

30
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.700
You still have to rely on the one above to enjoy the meal.

31
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.566
But the one up here has always been acting weird

32
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.133
Then why are we not idiots?

33
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.100
What did Mr. Gong say just now?

34
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.133
Hey, perform well at the golden dragon reception

35
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.766
If there is any errand

36
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:36.500
I can't spare

37
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.166
Don't worry, okay boss, it's awesome

38
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.433
OK boss is awesome
