00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.200
Ruoxi apologizes to Meng Di

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.766
I said no matter how little he plays a small temper

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.300
You can't make fun of other people's lives

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.633
That's not him.

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.900
I apologize, why should I apologize to him?

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.300
I've never apologized to anyone since I was a kid.

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.166
You were reckless in this matter tonight

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.666
You're blaming the wrong person.

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.866
You hit people?

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.166
Shouldn't you apologize?

11
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.866
Ok, I see it too.

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.233
For the sake of my child's father

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.100
I just apologized to him

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.566
Sorry.

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.833
I blamed you tonight, it's alright

16
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.133
Is it messy to care?

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.333
Thank you Qianyun Longjun for clearing my grievances

18
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.700
I will definitely remember your kindness

19
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.700
Now that things are settled

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.566
Let's continue to celebrate grandfather's birthday

21
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.866
Mr. Lin

22
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.500
For the sake of the Lin family's kindness to me

23
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.266
I should still say something to you

24
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.766
Happy birthday to you.

25
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.766
Happy Birthday

26
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.000
Houfu Wujiang

27
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.766
Thank you Wang Jun

28
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.800
Okay, I've paid off the favor I owe the Lin family

29
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.266
From now on, we don't owe each other

30
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.366
Please take care.

31
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.800
Ruoxi, let's go

32
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.600
Gong Send the Dragon Army Send the Dragon Army

33
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.600
He just left.

34
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.300
What about your resources?

35
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.433
What else could we do?

36
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.300
He and Ji Ruoxi both have children

37
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.400
So be it.

38
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.600
Sister, you have to catch him well

39
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.200
You don't have any resources now.

40
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.300
If we don't catch him

41
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.900
What will happen after we leave?

42
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.233
I'll figure it out.
