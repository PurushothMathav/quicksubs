00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.800
Hahahaha

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.600
I heard right

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.966
What are you pretending to be stupid for?

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.300
You bow to others every day

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.866
The bottom of society who beg for food

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.100
Exit wildly defiant

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.933
10 million is you from Qin Shi Huang

8
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.233
The number that the base can't earn at first

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.866
What a summer bug

10
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.433
You poor loser

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.833
Use less language from others

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.100
Come on, you wasted a minute of my time today.

13
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.233
How to deal with it?

14
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.900
If you have any questions, please contact customer service?

15
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.900
I don't have time to hang out here with you

16
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:35.966
Yo

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.066
What is this hanging?

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.566
Isn't this big star Lin Mengdi?

19
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.166
You are his fan.

20
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.433
This p is quite realistic.

21
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.200
Give it back to me

22
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.300
You poor loser

23
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.966
I also want to marry a big star

24
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:56.033
You don't pee, just ask yourself if you deserve it or not

25
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.766
Your mom didn't tell you

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.866
Don't mess with other people's things?

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.866
You waste my time

28
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:05.066
Affect my money and destroy my mood

29
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.466
Just want to end it like that?

30
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.866
today

31
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.500
You give me this to eat dry wipe clean

32
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.166
Kneel down for me and kowtow three more times

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.566
Knock a little louder and I'll take you for a fart

34
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.300
Gently put

35
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.966
You let me go. What if I don't?

36
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.866
I can't help you.

37
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.233
You dare to hit me?

38
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.900
Do you feel that you have lived too long?

39
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.066
You dare to hit me, you wait to be fed

40
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:39.166
Lao Wang, someone's skin is tight

41
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.366
Come and give him an itch
