00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.666
I'll see who dares to touch him tonight

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.700
everyone

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.833
Tonight turned out to be the prestigious Golden Dragon Award

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.300
Why get angry?

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.200
These are some small ones I have prepared for you.

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.800
Gifts to everyone tonight

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.333
To be able to get what you want

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.400
As expected of Mr. Yue

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.966
Just shoot casually

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.866
Such a precious gift

11
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.600
Isn't this a diamond necklace designed by Mr. Yue himself?

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.266
It's still the latest model this year.

13
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.600
Isn't that a piece of cake for menstruation?

14
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.700
Thank you Mr. Yue

15
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.366
Just like it.

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.466
Let that kid go in advance

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.500
This is Yue Xiaorou, president of Yue's Group

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.033
The only leader of Blue Snow Tripod Master in Great Xia

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.233
New products every year are hard to find

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.000
If you can get in touch with him

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.933
Get the endorsement

22
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.900
Your position in the entertainment industry in the future

23
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.733
It's a leap to the sky

24
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.900
So powerful

25
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.033
That's as long as you get the endorsement

26
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
Your worth is immeasurable

27
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.666
Endorsement fee is free

28
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.600
The gift given by Mr. Yue is too delicate, right?

29
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
As expected of VM

30
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.733
You know design.

31
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.233
Of course not, you understand.

32
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.400
However, the design of the total month appears

33
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.266
These moments are dim on us

34
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.800
Are you so blind?

35
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.300
You can also see the ingenuity of my design

36
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.466
What do you mean?

37
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.400
Do you know who is sitting there?
