00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.100
Something bad, Mr. Yue

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.100
What's up?

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.400
group

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.500
Now under unexplained financial attack

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
It's at stake now. What?

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.166
What the hell is going on?

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.466
Can't find the reason now

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.933
monthly total

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.100
Maybe it's an indiscriminate attack by overseas hackers.

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.533
Mr. Yue, we have lost tens of billions now.

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.466
Go on like this

12
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.766
I'm afraid our menstrual group will disappear

13
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.000
And you single-handedly took the moon from a run-down family

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.466
Make a name for yourself

15
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.900
Don't you just pay for it? Impossible

16
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.533
You are all my high salaries from Wall Street

17
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.700
Hiring talent

18
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.400
How can you be helpless?

19
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.266
Yuesao, we all tried our best

20
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.400
Trash is fucking trash

21
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.400
Miss Yue

22
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.266
I didn't order dessert for your takeout. You sent it wrong.

23
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.166
I know I gave it to you.

24
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.000
You are the delivery guy who was bullied just now.

25
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.466
I especially thank you

26
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.900
Like I said, a little effort isn't enough.

27
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.266
Don't you see I'm busy now?

28
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.300
Please don't disturb me.

29
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.466
What if I could solve this?
