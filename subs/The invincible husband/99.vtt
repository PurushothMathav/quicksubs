Hello

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Excuse me, the menstrual group is a small group.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.400
To the position of the first wealthy house in the building today

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.566
What happened behind it?

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.266
Miss Yue

6
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.766
Once upon a time, menstruation was an inconspicuous small group

7
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.866
But now not only has the Kim Group been acquired

8
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.700
It also received investment from Genting Group

9
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.300
So what's happened here?

10
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.733
Ms. Yue, I would like to ask

11
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.400
This Mr. Xue Zhilong and Ms. Covenant

12
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.300
couple relationship

13
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.800
How did you two respond?

14
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.866
Then ask the two

15
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:22.866
Because of the relationship between the two

16
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.966
Is Genting Group the only monthly investment?

17
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.266
Here's another question.

18
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.266
Miss Yue and I are indeed in a relationship

19
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
I also like menstruation because Miss Yue is capable

20
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300
She single-handedly cultivates menstruation

21
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.400
Our Genting Group invests in menstruation

22
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.200
It's also because of Miss Yue

23
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.866
Mr. Long and I are indeed in love

24
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.766
But don't deny our monthly menstruation because of this.

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.266
I, Yue Xiaorou, never depend on anyone

26
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.500
We all know that.

27
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.300
But we also want to ask, uh

28
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.133
About this

29
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.466
How did your monthly affairs group develop?

30
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.766
And including that of our other groups

31
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.300
What are your thoughts?

32
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.400
There you go. Okay.

33
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.900
The press conference is over

34
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.666
Now is our time together
