00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.766
Open up a price. Can you afford this tower?

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.800
The tower is really his

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.300
If you are the same

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.033
Is the person who wants to save me too?

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.633
Sun Expert Daily

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.566
Oh, expert Sun, you are finally here.

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.766
Look at how much my son-in-law's tower is worth

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.500
If you can get a good price

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.333
I do it for my son-in-law

10
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.033
Don't let go of your worries

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.766
Hey, the plan is this, the money for this lie

12
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.566
Except you honor my family

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.633
Three left

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.866
How about nothing?

15
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.166
Why do you think I'll give it to you?

16
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.066
Hey Yanyan

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.966
Companies need capital to go public

18
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.133
As long as you are willing to help our Wang family

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:45.100
Then I will consider remarrying you

20
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.133
Sun experts should say

21
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.700
Give me shit

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.966
Congratulations to Jiang Shao for doubling the price of treasures

23
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.633
What baby is not his pharyngitis, okay?

24
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.966
That's not Expert Sun.

25
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.500
We are still in the dark

26
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.100
I still expect you to call me the Wang family

27
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.300
You are worthy of my Wang family's cultivation of you

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.833
Thank you for calling me my mother for three years

29
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.933
I already said it

30
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:16.233
You'd better count on him than on a beast

31
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.700
I really saw you right

32
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.366
You're just as defiant as ever

33
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.500
speak wildly

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.633
This is the common problem of you people at the bottom

35
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.800
My father hates it when people lie

36
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.066
Get out of here before he comes

37
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:37.000
Okay, just in time to show him that he chooses to ignore

38
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:38.900
What kind of face is it?

39
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.966
What are you, a little internet beggar?

40
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.900
I still want to get involved

41
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.600
You don't pee, do you deserve it?

42
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.900
Defiant no one disrupts the banquet

43
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.466
Occupying the position of the upper soldier is even more of a crime

44
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:54.400
Somebody break his leg and throw it in

45
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.800
Dad

46
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.833
The pheasant is not worthy of the phoenix

47
00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:58.900
Not to mention

48
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.866
You are a wild dog about to have its leg broken

49
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.300
Hmm go

50
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.066
Wait a minute.
