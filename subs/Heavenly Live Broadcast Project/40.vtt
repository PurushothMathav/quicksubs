00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.766
Hey, sister, are you so lucky?

2
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.066
Got it again

3
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.666
I hate that people just miss you

4
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.166
Drop by the world to see you

5
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.466
I still have to go back later.

6
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.333
Without further ado

7
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.600
Before that hoof comes

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.366
Let's make it quick

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.366
Who is he?

10
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.666
An old witch

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.700
He's been around for thousands of years.

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.800
You have to be careful of getting a spare tire.

13
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.400
Looks foreign

14
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.700
I'm so glad he's here.

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.233
I'll go first

16
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.600
Sister, where have you been?

17
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
Hey sister

18
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.700
Foreign style I want foreign style

19
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:58.266
Give it to me, don't come over, haha.

20
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.400
Cool boss

21
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.566
Give me another 300 roasted whole sheep
