00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.233
Okay, tell him he really knows the law

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.900
Hospital President Ye Yaozi Medical Expenses List

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.866
Computer shows trace

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.000
I can't find it

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.433
Can't find it

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.766
Impossible how is this possible

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.500
Let him find out the ups and downs alone. It's a treasure

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.933
This old man can change his fortune

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.866
If the computer can't find it, there is no need to pay the fee?

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.400
Really guilty, you really think of yourself as a family, don't you?

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400
Don't forget this is a hospital

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.466
I have the final say

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.600
That's right, Mr. Liu is right

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.366
Your sister has spent a total of money since she was admitted to the hospital.

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:34.900
30 million.

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.100
Impossible, definitely not so much.

17
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.266
I've only lived there a few years

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.066
What do you know?

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.300
Dare to offend Liu Shao

20
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.366
If you can't take out the 30 million today

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.966
Even if you're still breathing

22
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.566
I'm willing to push you to the morgue

23
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.700
You rubbish

24
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.700
It's the background that comes out

25
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.266
Strength is luck

26
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.566
Lucky you are rich

27
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.466
What are you pretending to be here with a broken floating god?

28
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.300
Can Liu Shao hear a sentence?

29
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.900
It's called destiny.

30
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.866
The skin can't dry out, big tree receptor

31
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.800
Mortal embryos also want to change their fortunes

32
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.566
Miss Su, Miss Lin

33
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.200
What brings you two here?

34
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.800
I'm here to inform you

35
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.000
Ye Yao's medical expenses are free

36
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.866
Impossible Miss Su

37
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.966
This is a hospital.

38
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.233
5 minutes ago, my Su family had a whim

39
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.800
Has been desperately acquiring

40
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.866
Now I have the final say here

41
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:30.166
And you have a day off to get out of Yunzhou?

42
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:30.966
otherwise
