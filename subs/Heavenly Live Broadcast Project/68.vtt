00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.700
Hey, hey, hey.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.400
Long Bajie or

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.833
You can lend me the book of life and death for two days

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.266
Life and death book

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.366
That won't work.

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.500
The Book of Life and Death is the quality assurance of our Netherworld

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.800
It cannot be changed casually.

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.400
You can't give it to others casually

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.900
Hello saint

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.966
You have to die

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.033
I'll be right there.

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.600
Hey, wait for me for a while.

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.666
Yama Rock is fake

14
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.766
I'm the real one

15
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.166
This is damn good

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.400
Migrant worker

17
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.600
Who can't use who?

18
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.633
I'm leaving.

19
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.066
Hey.

20
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.600
Hey

21
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.100
Great Saint

22
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.766
Great saint

23
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.866
Hey, hey, great saint, hey, hey.

24
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.133
The boy has something to ask for

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.166
I would like to trouble you to come down to the world

26
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.000
The world hey hey

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.800
Not available. Not available.

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.266
Death

29
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.800
I still have to pick peaches from the Valley of the Kings

30
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.266
Tomorrow, I have to dare to go to the Buddha Hands to pee

31
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.766
Can't get numb, can't get numb

32
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.266
You this time

33
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.300
It's really useless

34
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.800
Hey, is this card good?

35
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.166
First of all, my grandson wants it.

36
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.233
Take the time to fight the landlord

37
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.266
Not a great saint

38
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.166
Aren't there four of you?

39
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:27.333
Hey, that local donkey was caught yesterday.

40
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.033
Just take it back

41
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.700
When do brothers have fun?

42
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.866
Hey, Great Sage, Great Sage

43
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.700
Are you stepping on colorful auspicious clouds to pick me up?
