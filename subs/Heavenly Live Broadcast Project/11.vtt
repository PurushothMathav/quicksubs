00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.766
Yano, when did you take me

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:08.266
How can a dead ghost move his hands and feet casually?

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.200
Sister, I just tried it casually.

4
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.866
This is a secret between you and me

5
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.300
What others don't want to know

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.500
stingy

7
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.700
Who doesn't know that he is the actor you invited?

8
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.066
What does this prove?

9
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:25.100
Is he really married to a fool?

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.833
If you really want that baby, it can be cheaper, you bastard

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.466
Cut the crap

12
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.300
I will replace the two ladies

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.000
Break your legs, you trash

14
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.766
Throw it out, what are you?

15
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.866
How dare you point fingers at my man

16
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.000
Are you mistaken?

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.966
He he he he is a piece of trash

18
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.066
If he is trash

19
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.700
Then you're called a stinky reptile

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.300
You are worse than trash

21
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.933
Yes, can you two eat and fight?

22
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.400
How is this?

23
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.466
Husband, since you are divorced

24
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.700
Then come with me to get the certificate.

25
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.300
You shameless hoof

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.400
A word is obviously mine

27
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.100
If you want to get a certificate, I will get it from him.

28
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.333
Follow Me Follow Me

29
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.733
Follow Me, Follow Me, Follow Me

30
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.366
It's too exaggerated for social people to use it with me

31
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.166
Follow me follow me here

32
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.200
Why do you have to save

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.966
Trying to direct and act this play?

34
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.833
I, Wang Qian, am not a fool.

35
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.200
Don't believe it?

36
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.566
How to believe in the Cloud Chamber of Commerce

37
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.900
Will see you through the sewer

38
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.866
Still believe that these two people know you're going to jail

39
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.700
And keep a widow for you

40
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.033
Don't forget that you killed Liu Ruyan

41
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:39.400
I won't gamble with my Wang family

42
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.366
Since you said that the two of them are actors

43
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:43.166
that

44
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.233
What about them?

45
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.100
A wealthy family member proposed to Ye Shao

46
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.333
When your sister proposes to Ye Shao

47
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.966
My five sisters proposed to Ye Shao

48
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.400
Yunzhou Liujia Liu Ruyan proposes to Ye Shao
