00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.500
After self-fall

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.966
The cultivation base of the Ruler Mirror was divided into three and scattered around the world

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.566
The first one is hidden in the ancient battlefield of fighting against the demons

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:12.033
The second cultivation base is hidden in the Immortal Destruction Sword

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:16.366
But only this third cultivation base is missing

6
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.666
Now I am also a saint sword cloud horse

7
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.466
It's a thin line away from the dominant mirror

8
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.266
January has come

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.300
No time.

10
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.633
forced breakthrough

11
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.766
Sure enough, it still doesn't work.

12
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.100
This line has not been broken through

13
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.533
It seems that the return to the dominant mirror

14
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.000
It's not going to happen overnight.

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.933
The power of the film has been restored.

16
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.633
This momentum is much stronger than that of him back then

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.866
Apply film to practice with mortal lives

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.166
The more people we kill

19
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.666
The stronger

20
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.066
I have to get out of customs right now

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.666
Otherwise, wait until the lives are destroyed

22
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.000
It's all over
