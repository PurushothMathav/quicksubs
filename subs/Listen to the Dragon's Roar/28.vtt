1
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.533
Sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.033
You just got started

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.200
The disciples of the four seals are not ordinary people

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.366
You can't be brave

5
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.300
He hurt the red fish like this

6
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.066
This blood debt

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.300
I'm going to get it back no matter what

8
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.966
According to the rules of this dance

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.933
If I win, I can specify the challenge to others

10
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.066
Yes, but only if you can win

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.100
I'm in a hurry.

12
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.866
You go together

13
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.000
I want to type ten

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.766
Ten want to be the savior, it's up to you

15
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.200
young and frivolous

16
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.900
Do you know how to write the word death?

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.833
Louder, since he has to court death

18
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.100
Why don't we follow his wishes?

19
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.666
You go together

20
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.166
Send him on his way

21
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.166
What's he doing?

22
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.600
These are all elite disciples who eloped

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.100
One person poisoned 10 in a row

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.433
This is our last resort

25
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.700
It seems that the defeat has long been

26
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.266
Yeah.

27
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.766
Among a group of Wuhe

28
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.066
Your arrows

29
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.966
Too slow.

30
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:47.333
This

31
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:48.800
That's not possible.

32
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.600
Did you see it clearly?

33
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.466
How did he get that sword just now?

34
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.400
Can't see clearly

35
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.800
I didn't even see the afterimage of the sword wielding

36
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.100
This figure

37
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.466
Master
