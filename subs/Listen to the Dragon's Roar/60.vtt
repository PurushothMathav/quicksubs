00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.800
The man in this portrait is majestic

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.033
At first glance, it is the demeanor of the master mirror powerhouse

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.600
How could that be a lie?

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.066
Beacon fire without evidence

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.166
What evidence do you have to prove that this is false?

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.366
The evidence is simple.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.700
Because Qingyun Xianjun is not a man

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.333
It's a woman.

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.800
Hahahaha

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.033
Woman He said that Qingyun Xianjun is a woman

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.600
Women's cultivation is inherently difficult

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.066
It was even more of a

13
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.900
There is no female modification of the saint mirror.

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.333
Not to mention the master mirror powerhouse

15
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.566
You haven't seen the world

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.233
How dare you pretend in front of us

17
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.966
Believe it or not?

18
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.466
That being the case

19
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.766
Might as well let me kneel down to the portrait of Qingyun Xianju

20
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.833
Wait until I receive a blessing or increase my cultivation

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.833
It's not too late to humiliate him again

22
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.366
How is that possible?

23
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.900
How is that possible?

24
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:13.466
The portrait I emptied my house to buy turned out to be fake

25
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.866
Why don't you kneel before me?

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.166
I promise it will work better than kneeling

27
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.700
What is it?

28
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.100
Do you really think of yourself as the Immortal Lord of Providence?

29
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.266
Get away from me

30
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.900
Oh, what a pity.

31
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.566
This splash of wealth

32
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.900
You can't take it even if you give it to you.
