1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.700
I don't have to beat you.

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.666
I just want to die with you

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.900
This posture is a ten-square annihilation

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.166
It was this sword

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.933
Destroyed the mighty demons

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.100
We are saved

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.433
The first army burned its own military training

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.200
The power of this sword is deeper than it was back then

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.066
Do you recognize this sword?

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.666
How could you not recognize

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.300
This is the sword

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.633
Let this seat hate

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.766
It's the same today.

14
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.533
I will use it to pay homage

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.433
All the lives you took

16
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.833
This sword is so powerful

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.100
We did it!

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.500
We did it!

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.366
The devil is dead

20
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.733
That's great. You can't live without sin.

21
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.033
Long live Qianjun

22
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.633
How is that possible?

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.833
Hit by the World Defense Army

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.066
I only suffered this minor injury

25
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.700
Could it be that even the strongest opinion

26
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.633
Can't get rid of the demons?

27
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700
It seems we are still doomed to die

28
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.500
Hahahahaha

29
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.700
Your ten directions are destroyed

30
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:29.400
It doesn't work for me anymore.

31
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.033
I was prepared for this resurrection

32
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.500
I ate a lot of flesh and blood

33
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.433
Just to be able to withstand your sword
