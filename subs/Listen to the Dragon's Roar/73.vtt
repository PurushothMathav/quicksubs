00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.466
How could he?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.566
Why are you not dead yet?

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.266
That is God's experience

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.166
It's a realm beyond the reach of mortals like me

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.766
How about god

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.200
Gods and Buddhas

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.366
Tang is dead

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.300
This is my final strike

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.300
With the broken sword in your hand

10
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.866
I see how you cut me

11
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.366
The old sword still has lingering power

12
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.166
Broken fronts can also kill enemies

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.666
Qingyun Xianjun

14
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:46.000
Do you recognize this person?

15
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.500
This scumbag

16
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.866
Aoxue, leave me alone

17
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.866
Kill him to avenge countless Wang sinners next door

18
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.366
qingyun

19
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.466
You are weaker

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.433
This life cycle

21
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.833
Let you have too many feelings that you shouldn't have

22
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.166
And these feelings

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100
It will weigh you down

24
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.766
No.

25
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.966
On one side is the mother who gave birth to you and raised you

26
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.866
On one side is the world

27
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.233
How would you choose?
