00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.966
Crash into it

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.400
Will be turned over

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.433
The remaining power here is too thin

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.200
You have to go deep.

5
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.866
How could he have withstood such arrogance?

6
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.600
How did he manage to move forward with such stability?

7
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.900
Humph district tourism

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200
Even if he was lucky enough to cultivate to the second dynasty first

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.233
There will be no more miracles

10
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.933
The power here

11
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.733
It's beyond my tolerance now

12
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.866
Not enough.

13
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:39.100
You have to go to the deepest place to quickly absorb the breakthrough

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.200
Dad

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.700
mother

16
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.833
Wait for me.

17
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.900
No one can stop me

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100
He actually walked into the jungle at the center of the battlefield

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.333
Break through to the first three

20
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.900
It's a miracle.

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.266
A living miracle.

22
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.666
What about miracles?

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.400
He practices in the center of the battlefield

24
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.600
Every attack will suffer a thousand times more pain

25
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.166
Up to three more attacks

26
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.966
He will live and die
