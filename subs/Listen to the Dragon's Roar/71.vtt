00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.266
I am no longer the devil of my day

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:06.100
And you're still standing still.

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.766
What happened to the thousands of troops and thousands of barracks?

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.600
I work hard for you to heal

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.800
Take care of your heart

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.666
I worked a hundred times harder.

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.266
I've run out of lights

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.033
Destroy the tree

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.566
I can fight again

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:31.033
Success or failure depends on this

11
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.933
I said your time is over

12
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.433
It doesn't work for me anymore.

13
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.833
You're struggling like an ant

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
How can there be a half immortal?

15
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.833
I wasn't born strong

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.033
But there's blood in my bones that won't let me bow

17
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.866
Xianjun

18
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.066
No.

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
Even if you open the sky with one sword, what can you do?

20
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.400
I want to see you under this royal power

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.000
How to maintain peace in this world

22
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.366
Hahahaha

23
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.833
When Yin and Yang are in chaos

24
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.466
Stain the sky with my blood
