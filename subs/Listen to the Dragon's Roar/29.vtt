1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.400
He won with one against ten

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.966
It only took three days for him to reveal his peak

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.900
How could it be possible to advance by leaps and bounds to kill the Immortal Destruction Sword?

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.600
It must be relying on the power of the Immortal Destruction Sword

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.833
That's so awesome

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.466
I won, can I specify the person to challenge?

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.166
It's right to follow the rules

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.333
But the reference disciple of the four veins

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.966
All have been lost by your sword

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.300
No one can go on stage to gamble

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.700
That being the case

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.966
Now it's your turn.

13
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.166
But with the edge of the Immortal Destruction Sword

14
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.300
Dare to stand in front of our four elders

15
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.800
The arrogant girl Liu's generation also dares to challenge me to die

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.066
fuck

17
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.900
You don't practice swords

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.833
I am like a frog in a well

19
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.133
Erluoruo Cultivation Sword

20
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.600
I am like floating to see the sky

21
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.733
you

22
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.900
Chaos Sword Sect

23
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.166
There is a way to kill

24
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.166
chaotic

25
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:07.766
You're wrong, I'm just participating in the dance front

26
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.133
And the dance is not over yet

27
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.800
My sword will not stop

28
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.466
Even the four elders were defeated

29
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.933
Who else does he want to challenge?

30
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.100
This Qingyun Sword Sect

31
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.300
There are people more powerful than the four elders

32
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.200
Could it be

33
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.800
Situ Haotian

34
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.766
It's your turn.
