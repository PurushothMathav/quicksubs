00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.433
rumor

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.200
All of your Holy Master's tips were learned from me

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.366
It's sort of a spread.

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.300
speak out

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.733
A nameless junior

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.700
You still dare to claim to be the master of the Holy Lord

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.000
The Holy Lord is now a saint in the realm of great perfection

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Only one step away from breaking through the tenth level of dominance

9
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.000
What qualifications do you have to teach him, old man?

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.166
Are you Qingyun Xianjun?

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.400
Qingyun Xianjun

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.066
If he is Qingyun Xianjun

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.066
I'll rip my head off and kick it

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.466
If I were

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.166
How should you respond?

16
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.833
Empress children can only lie

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.800
Not long ago, I spent a lot of money to construct a fresh pair

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
Portrait of the New Army

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.466
Let you open your glasses today

20
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.766
Why did you just hear about it?

21
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.833
Dominate the marcher

22
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.200
Even a portrait

23
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.633
You don't have to lose the charm of Tiandao

24
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.100
Kneeling and worshiping can improve its cultivation

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.466
It's so useful.

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.700
It really is.

27
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.600
So

28
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.900
When buying it back home for worship at all costs

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.666
How about the heroic appearance of my ancestors?

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.666
The difference between you and the light ancestor in the portrait

31
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.533
What's there to say?

32
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.766
A lie can make you so happy

33
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:23.000
Great elder, this money is spent on true value lies
