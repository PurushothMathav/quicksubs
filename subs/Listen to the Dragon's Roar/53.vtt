1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.400
The original session

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.200
The book that was almost killed was wiped out

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.466
The wound left behind still hurts faintly to this day

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.333
How should I repay you?

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.400
That arrow didn't kill you completely

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.800
It's the biggest regret of my life

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.466
Your regrets are much more than that

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:22.766
I will let you see with your own eyes everything you protect

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.800
Turned to ashes

10
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.766
demonic heresy

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.500
It's useless to talk too much

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.500
Die

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.900
Now you are only a saint

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.166
It's not enough to kill this game

15
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.766
Just shot a few times

16
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.066
It has exhausted most of your strength

17
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.000
If I'm right

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.266
You are holding on now

19
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.233
Hahahaha

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.766
I will soon be resurrected

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.766
Suppressed by heaven and earth

22
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.300
You can't do whatever you want

23
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.400
today

24
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.433
click until

25
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.233
Until I have sucked enough flesh and blood

26
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.833
I will end everything in this world

27
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.066
Including you.

28
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:16.733
Peach

29
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.900
Do the dignified demons just hide in the east?

30
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.800
You don't have to hit me.

31
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.500
Then I will wait for you on the ancient battlefield

32
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.966
Are you coming or not?

33
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.800
The world will become prey

34
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.933
Lord Tianmo has come to the world

35
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.233
You dragons

36
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.466
Cherish your last days

37
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.566
Hahahaha

38
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.300
One more month.
