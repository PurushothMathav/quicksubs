00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.390
If you smile again, I will kill you. roll!

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.890
Mr. Shun, the fact that you woke up,

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.290
I'm afraid I really won't be satisfied.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.950
Yunlan also wanted to help me.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.910
What does this have to do with you? I didn’t expect it to last long.

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.960
So what are you going to do next?

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.530
After running for so long, it's time to fight back.

8
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.750
Will the facts become familiar?

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.640
Isn't it an official?

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.640
Why did you wake up? Yun Qi.

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.650
What did you say?

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.550
Yun Qi, don’t worry too much.

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.110
Even if Shun Yunlan wakes up,

14
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.910
After all, it has been two years.

15
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.050
There is no place for her now

16
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.910
You are now the prudent vice president

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.040
Don’t we still have to rise from the sky?

18
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.280
you're right

19
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.840
But what?

20
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.710
Xiaonian was always around before

21
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.730
I'm worried about what evidence she has in her hands

22
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.790
You can't do it lightly now

23
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.010
Regardless of causing them some trouble, it's still pitiful
