00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
Are you awake? When did you wake up?

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.670
Now is not the time to talk about this, let's get out of here first.

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:25.850
Nickname, that's really not the case.

4
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.850
You idiot, can two legs go on four wheels?

5
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.050
It’s useless. If you don’t believe it, neither you nor the woman can catch it.

6
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.720
Sounds like, what should we do next? Don’t worry,

7
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.660
Even if Yi doesn't work, there will always be a next time, and she can always be saved.

8
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.550
So, it was already possible before,

9
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.060
It's to collect evidence and catch the mastermind behind the scenes,

10
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.640
Just continue to pretend to be in a vegetative state. I have been lying down,

11
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.090
If someone harms me, if he relaxes his vigilance, I may suffer from it.

12
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.790
Come on, the plot of the number of people is based on the period of prosperity and military review.

13
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.600
The truth is hidden better than you

14
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.170
It’s really dark too

15
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.480
Didn't you expose yourself to the fight today?

16
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.320
Leave this matter to me

17
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.530
This is not impossible

18
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.190
I am responsible for your safety

19
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.360
I think you are quite interesting.

20
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.140
Where did you start with these words?

21
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.190
You still know it hurts

22
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.230
You threw up your hands to catch me earlier

23
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.890
You're lucky if you haven't broken up at all.
