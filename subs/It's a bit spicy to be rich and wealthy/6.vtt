00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.880
Are you looking at me like this?

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.440
nothing. You go down first.

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:23.050
My sister-in-law is really decent.

4
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.990
Let the whole family wait for you.

5
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.940
Dad, Dad, you don’t have to wait for me anymore.

6
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.850
Just eat first. What are those words. It's a family.

7
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.440
Of course it will be a miracle. I heard about you,

8
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.200
Go to the Cross-Strait Hospital to accompany Yunlan. I often read simple books to him.

9
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.860
This little thing is not worth mentioning.

10
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.320
I can marry you. What a blessing for Yunlan.

11
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.870
You should spend more time with Yunlan on weekdays.

12
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.700
It turns out that if I wake up

13
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.420
Mom will never treat you badly

14
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.370
It turns out there is some relief there

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.080
OK, eat it

16
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.520
If I remember correctly

17
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.140
It's talking about a vegetative state, right?

18
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.840
It must be someone else's family that is laughing.

19
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.100
It’s also taking care of people in a vegetative state, so what’s the difference?
