00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:10.230
Weather, who is looking for you again? Where can I put the weather stone? I'm worried about it.

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.250
Discussing the weather, what, is the relationship between the weather and you known by them, I don’t owe you,

3
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.450
Why are you calling me now? Wait, since he let me lose, we have to

4
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:37.710
Admit it to them and ask for a show. You are also a parent. You said, we raised him like this.

5
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.100
Is it easy? How can he care about the kind of thing he is doing now? As far as I know, look

6
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.900
If you don’t believe it today

7
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.610
Go directly to mom

8
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.650
Just work hard and be firm in person

9
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.180
It may not be possible to imprison her

10
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.340
Besides, she has no backup plan

11
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.520
It's better not to risk others

12
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.050
But your dad called you so many times

13
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.040
We can't even see you in person

14
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.730
Thank you so much Yun Qing

15
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.840
Sister-in-law, don't be polite

16
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.630
I just can’t bear to look away and ignore Gu Mou.

17
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.930
Just change Qiannian to remaining

18
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.360
Don't blame dad for being so light.

19
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.430
Your parents raised you so big

20
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.090
How could you send Kochi?

21
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.830
Don't take care of your parents
