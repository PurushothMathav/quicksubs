00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.300
Where's Photography Blue? He's in it.

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.100
certainly. That's just right,

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.380
I'll go in and have a look. Pack,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.810
Keep pretending. Who turns up the air conditioner so high?

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.630
What about our perturbed feelings of pride? Is it hot?

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.400
Are you still on the road? Stop pretending.

7
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.120
Hey, wake up,

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.920
Wake up, wake up quickly! Wake up photography blue,

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.880
Ouch, madam, what are you doing?

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.800
We've been dating the Photographer for two years? Get up,

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.080
I originally wanted to open the canned quantity for you to exchange.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.110
Since you won't cooperate, don't blame me for using other methods.

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.670
My subordinates don't understand what you are saying.

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.800
Then explain it to me

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.880
This usually only depends on the favorable eyes

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.320
I think it's a bit similar to the gesture of our chief judge.

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.180
But itâ€™s not us, is it?

18
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.910
I'll find out after I check it
