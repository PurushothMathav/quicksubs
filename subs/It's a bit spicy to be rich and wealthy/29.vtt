00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.200
Take a breath, do you want to be so cruel?

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.700
No matter how cruel I am. Are you better than your younger brother?

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.580
Keep playing your role. your secret,

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.720
I will keep him a secret for you.

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.500
What's up?

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.600
Pull the system. What's going on here?

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.140
I said, the one you want to reduce first.

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.460
That's what I did for myself.

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.660
I will give you whatever I have to fight for. Mr. Sheng,

10
00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.410
Why don't you tell the young lady?

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.310
That lever was left to you by Mr. Sheng before he left.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.430
If she likes it, she will give her Hongshu.

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.780
She is not an outsider either.

14
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020
It's rare for Lian Sheming to care so much about Zheng,

15
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.330
It sounds very good before. OK,

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.330
Continue to take the lead with Sheng Pingqi

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.200
I've already asked

18
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.300
In addition to blog mother and zombie years

19
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.410
It seems that Zhang Ma is the one

20
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.260
It's a pity that she was not caught

21
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.760
Otherwise I must figure it out

22
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.760
Sister-in-law still knows to come back

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.090
Where are you going, sister-in-law?

24
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.550
I wonâ€™t go to see my elder brother again.

25
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.900
you ate wrong

26
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.400
I'm just worried

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.130
Yes, you forgot about business

28
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.310
Then on the surface I

29
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.350
I have to do it.

30
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.340
Make a plan. How long will you let me pretend?
