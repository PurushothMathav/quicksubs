00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.190
What's your look?

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.930
Have you ever treated your biological parents this way?

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.700
biological mother. Have you seen all this?

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.790
This is his attitude towards us now.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.230
Don't worry, I'll talk about him later.

6
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.910
It’s also our fault that we didn’t teach him well,

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.820
Last time we kindly went to visit our son-in-law in the nursing home with gifts.

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.930
He was so bad that he didn't even give us a good look.

9
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.160
Qiao Ni, sister-in-law, this is really the case.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.740
How to do this to your biological parents

11
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.670
It doesn't look like you either

12
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.700
People can't forget their origins

13
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.700
It's my turn to speak, right?

14
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.170
So different

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.700
You sold me for a good price

16
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.280
Put ten million in your pocket

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.800
In less than five days, I lost a golden light

18
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.360
You still dress me like my in-laws and get paid

19
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.530
Don't you just try every possible means?

20
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.180
You're afraid that I'll live a familiar life, right?

21
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.550
Why don't you even have the face of your own parents?

22
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.970
You are left with a conscience

23
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.690
You have a conscience, but you are afraid of foreign affairs.
