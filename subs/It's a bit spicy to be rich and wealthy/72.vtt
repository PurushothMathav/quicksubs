00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.010
This is the budget table for the project cooperation between Shengshi and Tianxi.

2
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.620
I have told you many times that you should call me Chairman in the company.

3
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.870
Chairman, I have something to report to you.

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.980
Let’s sit down and talk about the decades of cooperation between Shengshi and Tang Da.

5
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.000
Tian Qi donated his life with this sense of courage for a long time.

6
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.520
I really don’t know how high the sky is.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.140
From this day on, it is obviously a powerful company that has never been known to make money.

8
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.350
Not only can we cooperate with Shengshi on several major projects.

9
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.960
They can also steal partners from Shengshi Province.

10
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.500
There is a big problem here.

11
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.820
Yunlan, what do you think we should do?

12
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.280
Be prepared to succeed

13
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.200
business field

14
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.740
It's normal for you to argue with me

15
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.360
The business world is as cloudy as a battlefield

16
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.320
You actually said such a thing

17
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.510
You are really not a qualified leader

18
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.830
That's not how this works

19
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.010
Cooperate with the weather

20
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.030
your situation with him

21
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.080
Well, you're not just doing nothing

22
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.190
Fortunately, I didn't leave all the rest in your hands.

23
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.450
Otherwise, nothing will happen

24
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.540
I don’t know how many years Yuanqi has been

25
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.720
The idea has been around for so many years

26
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.900
It turns out that the company will have to count on you in the future.
