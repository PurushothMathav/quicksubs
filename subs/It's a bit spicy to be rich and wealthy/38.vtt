00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
What does Qiaoni rely on to be happy?

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.050
Qiao Ni, I know the person you like is me,

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.470
Only I am no longer here, there was no Zuo Ai before.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.840
This wonderful sound is flowing far and wide.

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.160
It's a bit clever. We have been strong since the beginning.

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.400
Did you and I hear it?

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.440
Who bought justice for whom?

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.510
Yunqi, is this what you said?

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.090
How could it be possible that Mom said it to me? This is all her fault.

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.230
The wonderful sounds here were also synthesized by her. That's right,

11
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.930
aunt. Yunqi, how could she like Qiaoni?

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.910
She must be seeking the Shan family's property.

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.810
What a bad person to complain first.

14
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.860
Are you feeling guilty?

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.420
Yun Qi is your biological son

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.740
Don’t you even believe what your own son says?

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.030
What is your relationship with Yun Qi?

18
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.470
Aunt Su protects Yun Qi so much

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.100
And you and Yun Qi look really funny

20
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.000
Just like a model

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.490
I thought you were Sheng Yunqi’s biological mother
