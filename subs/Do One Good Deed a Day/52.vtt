00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.850
What about you? I came to see my future guardian,

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.290
I didn’t expect it to drop like this.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.250
From the past until now, that broken man has come to accept you,

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.610
If you don’t want you, we’ll change the price and ask for a thousand more,

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.000
Remember to talk, a thick treasure with several layers,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.420
Even if you have the ability to change the price, don’t be evil.

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.000
Do you know what I changed the price for?

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.080
Ah? The daily output is tens of billions,

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.880
We are the most tired today, so we became real,

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.520
Eight-digit Quaker,

11
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.940
In two days we will also be today,

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.980
Your listed assets are worth hundreds of billions compared to his.

13
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.920
It's you and Tan Gu who are having an affair

14
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.660
Start being your little baby

15
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.020
Is it true that you are also making money with me outside the family home?

16
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.490
I can't. Grab 500 grams of Shili Xianghan.

17
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.180
Sister, do you know any of them here?

18
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.620
I'm begging for food

19
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.460
If you want food, go to this road.

20
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.420
Maybe

21
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.300
Why are you cooking too?

22
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.140
give me what

23
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.660
I said that and I took him away.

24
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.920
If he goes to beg for food

25
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.680
No one gave him money

26
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:17.690
Here is five million

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.660
Another fight today
