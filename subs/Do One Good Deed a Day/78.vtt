00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.540
The flow of 10 billion has always been smooth.

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.920
I will take responsibility for you,

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.500
This is also my problem, give me the price of my body.

4
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.440
Grandpa, who are you getting married to?

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.050
You really have to get the one who doubts you.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.520
Grandpa, I had an issue with him.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.540
From now on I will go to whatever he says with my spirit,

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.110
If not.

9
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.210
Then I can also find out

10
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.270
Then I found

11
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.450
At that time

12
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.610
what does he want

13
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.510
I will give it to him

14
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.410
What does he like about me and you?

15
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.190
That line 2 is not good, why don’t you talk about it?

16
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.379
How can you kid be so sure?

17
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.210
It's the day after tomorrow

18
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.630
Has your money arrived?

19
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.410
Go to twenty one twenty one

20
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.450
Everyone gave it

21
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.050
Even if you don't give it now

22
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.130
you are so everything

23
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.560
It seems like you can’t take care of your family anymore.

24
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.350
How about I introduce a few to you?

25
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.190
To say something rich

26
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.910
you want to be young

27
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.550
There are still rich aunts

28
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.290
This performance is also relatively concise and repaired.
