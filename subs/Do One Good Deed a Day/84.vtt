00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.120
What does it mean to be killed?

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.100
Talk about the new work! Dragon King’s father’s people are coming to kill you!

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.710
What kind of body stick can Wan Wan find Wan Wan's father and the others?

4
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.020
There are three thousand people

5
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.619
You know I'm in charge of my afternoon

6
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.420
Under the system of heaven and earth

7
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.320
Then you can tell them all

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.770
Not this step

9
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.530
Finally, the road to join the enemy was newly opened

10
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.460
Defeat Yuma Tenchi and enter this possession

11
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.540
Go and fight to death

12
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.640
Really not only looking at the eyes and faces

13
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.420
Give him a shop, King Daddy

14
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.760
Unfortunately, today, the biggest explosion occurred

15
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.620
I not only want to kill him Jiang Han

16
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.270
I also want to bring out Wang Wang’s father.

17
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.130
I must be too in character

18
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.280
I will definitely be able to

19
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.360
This is the palace of Kyushu

20
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.760
Jiuzhou Jiefu

21
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.710
I am sure to be above ten thousand people

22
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.620
Why is it so hard?

23
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.750
I really want you to see it

24
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.300
Isn’t it how I discovered it in the first session?

25
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.370
But it's a pity

26
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.790
Look, you have no chance to see it

27
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.320
Because you are the one who fucked me now

28
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.100
I find your eyes now

29
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.240
I've passed you again

30
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.100
I'll make you alone next year for you
