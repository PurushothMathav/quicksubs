1
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.140
You are from the Dragon King Palace

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.710
What was your management of that Baoan just now?

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.110
Don't ask about the Dragon King Palace, little secret.

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.270
That's it. That gentleman just saved my secret.

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.050
I, Shajia Cast Silver, held a courageous dinner party for the whole class

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.710
Thanks to Dragon King Palace and Mr. Zhu Ming for their life-saving grace.

7
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.080
Please eat these dream transfers

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.140
People who can be with me in the Dragon King Palace

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.700
That Baoan is not sure

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.300
Hey, hug the security guard I guess

11
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.930
I want to know that she can't hide it. Help me.

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.290
Hurry, electricity rental

13
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.870
I've all been told not to take the exam at such a big poker venue.

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.980
Pick up electricity rent

15
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.400
The subordinate is already Charlie

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.600
The ancient dragon coin I talked about today

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.940
It was brought up by the school committee of the First Division

18
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.820
We were at Dragon King Coin back then.

19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.720
Only the stinky head

20
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.300
As for the method of renting intestines,

21
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.550
In the past few years, I have no longer been in Dragon King Coin.

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.150
It seems that I am helpless

23
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.620
We have arrived this time

24
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.840
I can't help but rent electricity to you, too.

25
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.240
The successful Dragon King coins are all melted away, right?

26
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.740
Hu Nian is here

27
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.040
I'm standing outside

28
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.320
I am grateful for the whole river journey

29
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.860
I can't hear what you're saying clearly

30
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.960
Are you going to Su's house tonight?

31
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.240
Should I go or not?

32
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.060
Didn't you agree?

33
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.919
Why don't you go?

34
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.730
Then help your daughter wear it if you are older.
