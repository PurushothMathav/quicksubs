Originally, my mother opened her mouth so loudly,

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.030
The guarantee of the opponent's field is not beyond the value.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.450
Even if it's just a foot or a centimeter of ashes,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.680
They are all more valuable than your stinky treasure’s beloved secret.

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.020
Let go of this. Today, even if you are a muddy and stinky person,

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.560
Let’s look at what is meant by the sky and the high ground,

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.570
I will live with him right away, your wishes,

8
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.220
Let you know where to live, that's,

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:48.160
You are really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really

10
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.700
Really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really

11
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.920
Really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.060
Really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really

13
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.840
He's on the Internet and I'll send you money

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.560
Not to mention that Diuke is so exquisite

15
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.910
And can you believe in the Great Buddha?

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.850
Is it fair for Umea to die?

17
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.040
Develop a disinfection system

18
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.990
Things from the red house

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.810
Tell you to take it out

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.690
It's so obvious that it looks big

21
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.020
Stop calling this stinky Baoan

22
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.510
I've never seen it in my life

23
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.590
How about so many valuable treasures?

24
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.260
No matter what you look at

25
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.000
Sorry

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.980
I was leaving just now

27
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.300
I really didn't see clearly

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.340
My dad thought it was trash

29
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.590
I'll take a closer look now to see if it's rubbish
