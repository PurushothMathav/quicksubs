00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.540
OK, I'll shoot you.

2
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.100
This is not done yet, but I have arrangements.

3
00:00:31.200 --> 00:01:09.560
This is not done yet, but I have arrangements.

4
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.360
These services are not willing to serve on the Lord

5
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.760
Found another biography of me, this is

6
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.800
Possible problem

7
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.430
That house has something like this

8
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.600
Five main causes of a terrible hundred years

9
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.700
Are you considering selling again?

10
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.540
This is so unimportant

11
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.600
When I was in Ruobu

12
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.920
I also want to see subsidies and housing

13
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.580
This is what it should be

14
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.560
Then please get in the car, master

15
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.700
Said no

16
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.030
Sincerity is not important

17
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.260
On the contrary, I strengthened my ten-year-old brother-in-law

18
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.600
You are still awesome

19
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.000
I know that my little brother has a clear face

20
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.900
Don't want to change

21
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.480
We were hidden all over the road

22
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.960
Just ride this and come here.

23
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.460
You participated in the ceremony as my boyfriend

24
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.060
Here are some of your electric vehicles

25
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.540
They all have to be mine

26
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.900
your boyfriend

27
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.590
You said that and you have considered my opinion.

28
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.590
Why should I ask you something?

29
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.230
I climbed to one thing to be your president

30
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.510
I am not worthy of a little treasure

31
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.450
My hands are the most handsome

32
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.750
Can you wait inside?

33
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.230
What gift have you prepared for you?

34
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.630
For the sake of old age

35
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.090
Grandpa is too thin

36
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.880
Just give me a piece of paper to make a deal

37
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.260
Although you are just a little baby

38
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.970
You didn't think you could tell me

39
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.010
I can certify it for you

40
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.670
You idiot

41
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.520
I definitely wonâ€™t tell you. Look clearly, this is a young lady.

42
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.740
Your boyfriend

43
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.740
Is he that poor ex-boyfriend?

44
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.980
Maybe I heard you say

45
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.020
Be a baby
