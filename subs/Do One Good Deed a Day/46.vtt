00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.530
It's down there, so late.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.280
Let me see, are you wearing the mask?

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.480
Almost, the person at the bottom is me.

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.780
Here are some good places to go.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.880
It turns out that this is called emotion.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.750
That's good.

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.180
Could it be the knife that used this force?

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.200
He doesn't want to kill me.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.740
Even though I tried my best, he still transformed me easily.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.640
This man blames me.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.540
If I go to join, I must maintain my thighs.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:54.000
Give it to you, let me answer the accident, it was me,

13
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.770
After you die, you just want to take care of me,

14
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.060
Believe it or not, it’s a pity. Even if you win, it doesn’t count.

15
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.930
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.900
Don't owe me anything

17
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.440
Missing your wife

18
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.580
Not looking for trouble at all

19
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.280
not on it

20
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.670
Concentrate on your coming into a global dark city

21
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.300
This will be your first order

22
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.810
But our opinion has not changed yet. Thank you.

23
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.950
As for where that door is finally gone?

24
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.530
I don't know anymore. It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.380
I don’t want to become a fool, so that’s not it.

26
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.570
Hong Yi, little brother, you are really good at joking.

27
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.290
This Dark World Alliance, Internet Design Global

28
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.370
Which member processing is forgotten

29
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.090
Even a practical and strong person like me won’t have confidence in it.

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.080
Not to mention, the leader of the alliance has already become the number one genius in the world.

31
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080
Not even becoming

32
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.430
Otherwise, I would go to the Overlord Array alone every day.

33
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.990
Dare to be the best in the world

34
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.910
I don’t know if I want to find the leader of the alliance.

35
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.390
No, I don't want to die, I have to find an opportunity
