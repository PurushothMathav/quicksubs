00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.690
Look, is it exposed?

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.390
Can I give you something to shake it with?

3
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.910
You wait with my sister-in-law, and I will ask you to see her off,

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.090
I also let you die because the people there doubted you!

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.140
You wait for me, I wait

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.340
You said, there are people who want to talk nonsense.

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.620
Don't worry, it's because of the people's love affairs

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.880
When I join Mr. Su, I will tell you the details of this matter.

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.200
They will all force you to be fired.

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.480
I wanted her to run away again, but Su was so unwilling.

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.220
No, she doesn't always want to, of course she will tell you personally

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.500
That's all he just said

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
All the people are gone

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.760
Just stop blowing it to me

15
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.920
We have been together for five years

16
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.780
what kind of person are you

17
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.540
I haven't invited the chairman yet

18
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.680
I use profession

19
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.540
Just let it be

20
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.910
Everything I said is true

21
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.550
Then you say yes

22
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.850
What kind of person is Sun Sun?

23
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.960
Women are good or bad

24
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.340
He is a capitalist

25
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.060
God come to me

26
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.540
It obviously looks like a dormitory

27
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.520
In fact, it’s just for getting married.

28
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.670
I hang up because of him

29
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.720
Okay, let’s just play the game.

30
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.500
Just stop blowing it to me

31
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.850
Then it's you again, I'll give it to you

32
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.730
But we have to agree on something

33
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.910
I'm not with you for anything else.

34
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.000
We are not from the same world to begin with

35
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.060
What I want is more than ten thousand people

36
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.920
Your mother is trying to rehabilitate you

37
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.140
you're fine

38
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.800
Then you can't see me now

39
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.000
When did I say I would stop drinking with you?

40
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.860
Not affected by water

41
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.930
Can I still come out like this, okay?

42
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.050
I'm not in the mood for love right now

43
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.120
You have also become like the peak with him the most

44
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.500
I must enter Su Jia's Yankun

45
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.860
The Lord who met Long Mengjian

46
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.100
Talked for a long time

47
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.280
I still want to see me
