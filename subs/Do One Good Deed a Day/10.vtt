I don't know if I should go home

17
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.180
But he was the only one who chased him

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.040
Not everything is clear

19
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.180
But I haven’t checked out the couplet yet.

20
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.440
Xiaoyue, come in, Su Gou

21
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.760
I've reached the level of 400 brains

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.920
All-in-one customization

23
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.920
This joint industry group

24
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.800
You gave it to me earlier

25
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.390
So heavy all the time

26
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.940
Who are you chasing?

27
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.860
You are a security guard

28
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.630
The power of company insurance

29
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.430
represents everything about this company

30
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.450
So when we go to work

31
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.150
Must join the Green Festival

32
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.750
Our catfish, you know?

33
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.840
Okay, let's go for a walk now

34
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.460
We spent millions

35
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.940
Ingredients that come back from all over the world

36
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.140
These Taiwanese breakfast dishes

37
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.170
Fish fish said fish fish fish yesterday

38
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.610
This kind of man this time

39
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.970
No, it's 10.08am now

40
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.650
Today Xuanlun asked me to become a normal person to celebrate the festival

41
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.320
Thank you for your hard work. Let's have something to eat.

42
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.490
Still keep fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish this is it?

43
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.840
Company regulations prohibit eating during the first half of the day

44
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.100
As an excellent employee

45
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.640
It’s always smoked fish fish

46
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.470
Do you think you just touched

47
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.420
Since I didn't see it, just eat it quickly.

48
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.620
Clothes for the smoke party

49
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.100
Do you start? Sitting is you

50
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.670
When you go to a cigarette party, you look at the house.

51
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.940
No way

52
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.440
Have you finished reducing the swelling? Should you take it for something else?

53
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.180
If you don't know how to choose, I'll go with you.

54
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.340
So what do you do?

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.340
How could you take it out?

56
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.060
Take it and reduce it

57
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.380
make some noise

58
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.060
You took my money and gave it to someone else in exchange

59
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.340
You wait for me a dollar ugly

60
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.980
The original owner is not the original owner

61
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.590
You wait for me a dollar ugly
