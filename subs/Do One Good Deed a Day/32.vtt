00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:15.940
The Totoro Order came to His Majesty Totoro to come out in person. The symbol of the highest authority was deceived into getting the big needle in person.

2
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.890
Went to rent Qin Yongzhong's My Neighbor Totoro and found out that the experience treated each other.

3
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.130
I'm afraid that the story is just ridiculous,

4
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.150
From this, it should be said that even people from My Neighbor Totoro Palace should not let go.

5
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.650
You're such an elementary school kid, you've made life miserable for Young Master Wu,

6
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.790
How do you create land?

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.500
Okay, right?

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.680
No reason, this is My Neighbor Totoro Order,

9
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.880
Due to President Suâ€™s irresistible decree,

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.000
Why don't you hurry up and beg?

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520
Then come here to save your life

12
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.740
Even if the kid is from the Dragon King Palace

13
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.560
You must also remember the Dragon King Palace

14
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.780
So you will know what happened, right Dragon King?

15
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.140
Good Dragon King

16
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.220
Even if you have the order in hand, you can turn back.

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.640
Will hold the door

18
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.940
I won't give you the Dragon King Palace to me either.

19
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.120
I tell you it's too big

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.080
Such a minor illness

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520
Those who continue to the Dragon King Palace will run away

22
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.230
I have an idea to do it first

23
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.450
Even if the Dragon King Palace comes

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.470
Also have to go to the Dragon King Palace

25
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.720
what is this

26
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.320
What is this?

27
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.220
This is our process

28
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.780
That doesn't really have any background.

29
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.100
You're such a bottomless person

30
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.720
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

31
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.740
You just didnâ€™t let me thank you so much just now

32
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.560
What on earth is it?

33
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.160
Since you can prove that you can't help but don't be busy with the ceremony

34
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.370
The spring of two hundred and four years

35
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.050
I've been waiting for you a long time ago

36
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.630
Since law is society

37
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.970
Murder must be punished
