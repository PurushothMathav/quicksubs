00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.770
Listen today!

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.700
If it hadn't been cleared by others,

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.780
Do you know that the one in Touki Dokuno is the Lord of Dragon King Ten?

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.340
My lord

5
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.800
I come to Jiangshi, Ninth Middle School

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.310
The Communist Youth met Liu Liu

7
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.470
Gu Nianqiang Hengdaoyinlu

8
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.050
Bloodbath all silver medalists at home and abroad

9
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.350
You admit that I gave birth to him

10
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.230
What if someone clears me out?

11
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.050
It's true that I'm dead or not

12
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.990
I haven’t seen you for so many years. How come you’ve learned to hide the broken train?

13
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.710
Why don't you die? Why don't you die?

14
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.190
Die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die you die Die you die you

15
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.190
Why don’t people listen to what they have to say?

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.500
Sure enough, beating in the chest will never make you old

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.080
Sure enough, we can’t afford the Internet

18
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:59.750
Do you have anything to say?

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.340
Now I know I'm afraid

20
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.560
Why did you offend you and you suffered for a whole day?

21
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.300
should have thought of

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.160
There will be this result

23
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.880
I regret it now

24
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.620
You call me

25
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:20.960
Don’t conquer those societies

26
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.000
Won nearly 100 billion

27
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.120
God has been out for nearly a month

28
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.780
How did these people get here?

29
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.720
surname gesture

30
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.640
surname gesture

31
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.400
Metropolis renovation

32
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.930
I also agreed to join music.

33
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.100
I don't want to enter the music too high God

34
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.160
we got news

35
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.530
I use the ice tray backstage

36
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.690
Zhaohui implemented

37
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.550
In order to get the chip that repairs this dream, they

38
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.630
On the day of the industry meeting

39
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.810
They should still send someone there

40
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.530
According to the itinerary, Zhao will be the best one.

41
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.760
I will tell you how many films he will have

42
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.850
I do have some

43
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.410
Just take them all out

44
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.810
What can we do?
