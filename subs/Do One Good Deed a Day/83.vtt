00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:09.000
You forgot you finished it once,

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.340
Tell me what kind of small boy you are,

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:23.990
Don't forget you explained, you blinded me,

4
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.360
Just wait for him,

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.360
He was still naive, and this step was broadcast,

6
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.160
Even if you have the Rabbit Sky Eye, why can't you come?

7
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.950
Someone’s little girl,

8
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.170
I want to bring the wind first,

9
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.330
It seems that I used to be able to ignore others,

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.580
Up to this point, it’s like this,

11
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.420
Must, ignore, ignore,

12
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.560
Ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore,

13
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.200
Ignore, ignore, ignore,

14
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.970
Ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore,

15
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.170
Ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore, ignore ,ignore,ignore,ignore,ignore,not

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.480
Ask us to answer the Yakuza Dragon Insect Yamato Head

17
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.440
I just didn’t order the underworld dragon insect.

18
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.320
Your mood is the end of your life

19
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.500
After all, you can just laugh at me when you call me

20
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.390
I won't let you know

21
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.010
That bully brother of yours

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.170
What is Song Renren?

23
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.730
The shopkeeper who didn’t order from us

24
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.880
But for the dark people

25
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.030
His husband's shop is so angry with him Jiang Han

26
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.820
The son also refused to succeed

27
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.110
casual democracy

28
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.310
What's Wangshagua?
