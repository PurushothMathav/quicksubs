00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.710
You can't go. How are you going to go? It's just that what should I do if I'm hurt?

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.330
There is no overtime work for our manuscript.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.610
Besides, I also made an appointment with Xiao Yinzi for dinner tonight.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.460
I'll give you whatever you want, I can give it to you

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.600
Anything is fine

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.600
Originally it was not possible

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.900
But if it’s you, it’s not impossible

8
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:31.280
3. I haven’t thought about anything.

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.070
You and I are the eldest lady of the vegetarian group, Quality Trade

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.610
There is only one man left

11
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.290
What happened just now was nothing strange. Don't leave.

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.920
It's okay. Someone will help you.

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.360
Who do I need to help?

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.760
you can't kill me

15
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.200
I said it, do you understand me? Someone is solving your problem?

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.040
I didn't think he would really come to save me

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.720
I think he doesn’t dare to take me seriously

18
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.260
International Public Disease Confrontation

19
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.040
The next time you get angry, most ordinary people will run away, right?

20
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.110
Go and get in the car, old and young, sit down and take a nap.
