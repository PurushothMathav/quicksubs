00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.000
I've been terrible before. In the end, it doesnâ€™t go to your body.

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.720
But during this time, I care about you very much.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.690
yourself. For example, if it's a long-term health issue, I don't blame you.

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.450
You already have someone you like, right?

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.070
The economy is still with you, and I still hope for you.

6
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.170
Don't talk nonsense. You like wild things.

7
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.230
So can I. I have everything they have.

8
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.280
They can play, they can do anything.

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:45.670
Am I awake?

10
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.430
Just a few hundred million soon

11
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.630
How many sauces must be mixed with

12
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.340
What are you doing?

13
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.400
This is the antidote

14
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.220
how can i die

15
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.540
then what do you want
