00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.320
If you don’t dare to come here, just learn Chinese.

2
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.340
There are so many people with a lot of literature,

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.800
This kind of person,

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.490
Take a look at this car king,

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.590
It's this kid, why on earth is he?

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.320
Such a kiss solved my attack,

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.300
So suppressed,

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.690
I'm afraid he is an electric bamboo who can play with electricity.

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.110
When you are clean, you are my support,

10
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.180
It’s not that he relies on the box,

11
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.720
You dare to order me,

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.780
No, no, sir, you are angry,

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.880
That's not what I meant, I meant,

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.520
Today, if you just let this car king go,

15
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.020
At the expense of our church’s face, you said,

16
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.520
It’s hard to explain when I go back. Don’t forget it.

17
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.860
before you come

18
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.940
But establishing a military status for the Pope

19
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700
This is to ask you to tell me if you can't handle it.

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.560
Go back, Your Majesty the Pope

21
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.700
We are to be the pope of the court

22
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.940
You are afraid of me but not of adults

23
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.600
Otherwise

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.540
I'm willing to offer our Gu family better services than our own.

25
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.840
I just ask you, sir, today

26
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.660
Keep this stinky baby for a year

27
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.850
God, thank you

28
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.500
Hurry up and get off school? Take care of my little one

29
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.760
Why do you break down real

30
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.160
Will you let the villain get it wrong?

31
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.360
Am I targeting him?

32
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.300
Am I targeting you?

33
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.240
I tell you

34
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.440
After he dies

35
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.340
You have so many people that I don’t even think about you anymore

36
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.830
Otherwise don't tell you
