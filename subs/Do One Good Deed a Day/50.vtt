00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.820
You make me make mistakes.

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.470
What are you thinking? I mean, are you careful when eating?

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.430
Thank you anyway?

4
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.230
Wow, it turned out to be a wine wash? I thought it was a wine wash?

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.110
Don't you think I can't finish it for you? Isn't it very hard today?

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.870
I just want to clean you up,

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.380
What about giving away a house?

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.280
You don't like it?

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.780
Like? I like washing dirty things the most,

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.720
I can do it every month, so why don’t you start quickly? Brother-in-law

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.780
I thought one day

12
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.280
Aren't you coming back?

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.440
why do you think so

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080
Am I wrong?

15
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.250
I just left like this anyway

16
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.390
You try to widen your body

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.080
Look how beautiful the West Bund music atmosphere is

18
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.360
How many big and young grass beans are there?

19
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.960
Most breasts like it

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.019
Same as her original meaning

21
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.520
I'll pay you a small amount of money to give you love

22
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.200
I heard it's true for you

23
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.680
different from them

24
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.860
I am determined to punish people

25
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.220
I didn't do anything

26
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.540
mom and dad

27
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.090
I don’t like my feet yet. I won’t eat anything if I don’t have anything to eat.

28
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.930
Forget it again

29
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.750
Forget it again

30
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.180
It turns out that I ate the wrong food.

31
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.300
Stayed up most of the night

32
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.370
What are you doing in my room?

33
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.540
don't know yourself
