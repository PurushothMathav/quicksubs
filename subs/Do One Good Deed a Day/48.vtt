00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.840
You go and get rid of the mental illness karma,

2
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.660
Why can we judge our rivals?

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.120
You're about to eat. We're both in the same boat, but we both have low recharging capabilities.

4
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.860
I want you to come back to me, you think I am crazy,

5
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.280
Just because my opponents can only look at honest ones.

6
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.210
Yes, what do you mean?

7
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.500
Then let me talk to you about some crazy things,

8
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.140
Much of you. What do you mean?

9
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.390
What do you mean? How dare you laugh at my little brother?

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.910
Even if you don’t, I won’t accept you.

11
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.690
You are not his friend, no? He ran away.

12
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.320
You will go home, and your family will call the police for you.

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.340
Why are you back again? Are you watching?

14
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.540
It was too dark all the way. My sister called me.

15
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.900
Are you afraid that you will be shipped back?

16
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.680
What others mean

17
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.700
What should I do if you never leave me? Come and say goodbye.

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.100
Let them secretly live in the location where they are busy

19
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.110
I really forgive you

20
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.590
Take it as dead words

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.990
I'm not lying to my sister

22
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.070
Tell me what my little brother wants to know, otherwise

23
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.190
I will be hurt if I come back with you.
