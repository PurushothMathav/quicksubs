00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.440
This Fuji, uncle said personally that he was going to deal with you?

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.080
What time will it be settled?

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.580
Speaking to Jiangcheng personally, I will never use your reasoning to read words again.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.960
With Zhijiang City, there were no words of his understanding in the whole wine.

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.420
Jiang Hai, I don’t know if you want to deal with me,

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.580
But messing around here,

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.240
Isn’t it more than wrong to reward oneself with the future?

8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.820
I don't want to hear your big words anymore,

9
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.700
If I were you, I would apologize to my uncle immediately.

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.500
Maybe this is because my uncle is upset and he is still worried about his life?

11
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.380
Xiao Yanmei, the Sioux teachings are average

12
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.800
I'm asking you to stop showing off and be anxious.

13
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.060
Wash the pot quickly

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.340
Hurry up and die

15
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.660
The Sioux firebending master took the photo

16
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.760
Get rid of this stinky thing first

17
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.160
Can you shut up, Sister Su?

18
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.060
My brother-in-law didn't do it on purpose.

19
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.780
She just prefers to tell the truth.

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.740
Did Su say something wrong? Little girl?

21
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.460
You are frightened by this

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.240
You fooled Quan

23
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.370
What does it mean sister?

24
00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.780
Jianghai exists this time

25
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.540
She really went too far

26
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.620
Your score is higher

27
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.880
I know that Mr. Sun of yours has offended you.

28
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.180
We and men are both young and don’t understand when it’s not raining or getting up, but

29
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.980
Don't you dare be here somewhere?

30
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.940
Here are the work clothes for a hundred dollars.

31
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.760
And will you pay for the broken leather shoes caused by this wave of work?

32
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.660
I tell you to pull up

33
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.610
This piece is pulling up the man opposite

34
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.590
Take action, take action, catch him

35
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.260
Please let us defeat the white tiger and save me

36
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.060
Pull this up and take it off for me
