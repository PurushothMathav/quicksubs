1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.460
No, it won’t be open.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.140
You just make a phone call and you're looking for hot shoes for a small fee.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.880
I just want our developed countries to break off the contract in order to survive.

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.800
Do you still ask me to take action personally for such a trivial matter?

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.480
He even took action himself. Look at this man who is an adult himself.

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.880
We have created a world, but it is all a white man’s world.

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.240
It’s the water of my Jiang clan

8
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.400
More powerful folk arts products

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.560
Even if the level drops

10
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.660
Every day, there are no three parties left to protect you.

11
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.630
You stinky Baoan

12
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.670
Are you a human being yourself?

13
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.090
That's right, sir.

14
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.470
Fang Shou's literati met each other

15
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.280
You're the one who's so funny

16
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.010
The habits of our eight major families

17
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.610
Master Cheng is laughing at me for asking for help.

18
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.730
You asked him to deal with us

19
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.950
You are so ridiculous

20
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.450
I've been following you for several years, uncle

21
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.550
I also had to look back and find out the case

22
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.590
You don't really think we're going to Guizhou

23
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.950
Usually one installment

24
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.490
I'm just afraid of you, right?

25
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.650
I tell you

26
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.870
If you only have one treasure, this stinky Baoan

27
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.210
It’s the way to be right with all of us

28
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.430
It's also you, Su Jiachen, who has mixed feelings

29
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.640
Let's crack a raw egg

30
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.320
I really want to go back to Qingfa immediately

31
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.580
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right

33
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.600
Some of my companies have stopped supplying source materials.

34
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.160
Lift your book and take off the cripples

35
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.060
Let your calligrapher go to you

36
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.980
you you are not you

37
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.280
Just ask for death yourself

38
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.770
You can't even read a book and travel across the country

39
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.270
How dare you say it now?

40
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.350
What kind of noble person are you?

41
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.430
Dare you say you have someone?

42
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.110
Is this the reason for keeping the family name in the dark?

43
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.600
You liar, I'll eat your mouth and I'll eat it

44
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.660
What what I don't

45
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.420
I won't argue anymore
