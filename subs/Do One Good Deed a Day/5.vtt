00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.960
Sister, I'm really not in the mood to coax you.

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.830
As soon as I came to the news, Su Jiao met again half way through.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.000
During the borrowing period, a big shot with a dragon's eye will appear.

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.020
I tried to find a way to get the Su family's cigarette ashes.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.230
Only then can we see the internal media loudly.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.950
Just one word, isn’t that good?

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.350
My sister didn’t say that he was going to take me to Su’s house for soot.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.140
You have to give this to him too. This is something the Su family wants to do.

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.110
When you think he has no money, break up with him.

10
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.090
I didn’t expect that he would be so capable after not seeing him for several years.

11
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.420
What does he do now.

12
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.690
Security guard. security guard.

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.620
security guard. security guard. OK one. OK one. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK

14
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.480
If I were a security guard, I would also design it.

15
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.050
You also plot

16
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.930
Aren't I a good person?

17
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.160
She said she was invited to shoot

18
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.180
Can I invite you to take a photo of you? Why are you doing this?

19
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.100
Thinking of you just to see me

20
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.240
It's true what people say

21
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.860
You have a plastic bag to invite children to be photographed

22
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.280
Not seen for so many years

23
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.580
Just ask for one day

24
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.540
When did you learn to lie?

25
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.410
Well, why are you here, brother-in-law?

26
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.170
I'm not looking at a few of me

27
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.050
In fact, it’s been many years

28
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.190
Are you really not procrastinating?

29
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280
Then I thought

30
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.820
Thinking of you in front of you

31
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.980
This will not give a status

32
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.000
Plan your show bookism will have you

33
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.120
I hear you listen and learn to save face

34
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.140
How many times do you actually want me to be willing to order? Is it normal? Is it normal?

35
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.460
There are usually rich people

36
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.660
There are usually rich people

37
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.390
Yes, I spent money

38
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.080
Activism

39
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.100
Once I know how to make money

40
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.340
I'm in a hurry for money, so I want to prepare the money I'll give to my family, hahaha

41
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.880
You see no use in money?

42
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.040
See also borrowing money

43
00:02:35.920 --> 00:03:01.170
Is this why Ping Gui passed?

44
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.330
Isn’t this job supposed to be for you? It’s money for you, right?

45
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.620
You, slow down and hurry up

46
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.920
There's nothing wrong with this place

47
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.440
right seat
