00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.600
Come on, I’d like you to come over,

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.730
Otherwise, I'll give it to you.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.350
Come, come, come, come,

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.140
Come, come, come, come, come, come,

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.680
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come,

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.480
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come,

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.680
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come,

8
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:44.580
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come

9
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.220
My dad fights with guns and I am still the eldest son of the Gu family.

10
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.720
Then I can give you the materials for annihilation.

11
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.480
Then it's impossible for me to save you even if I want to.

12
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.980
Why are you so nervous?

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.340
Am I okay?

14
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.090
That's because you're lucky today

15
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.110
That Venerable Xi in this meeting

16
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.330
What a perfect match

17
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.280
That’s why I escaped one thing

18
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.880
You don't dare

19
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.540
You will eat big tigers in the future

20
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540
this society

21
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.460
Not as good as you think

22
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.760
See even me

23
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.060
I am worried about making bread every day

24
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.740
So you will do your best like this

25
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.940
What’s more, you have to look at yourself and change yourself

26
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.980
Be more submissive

27
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.160
Don't hide from people

28
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.780
I have to go through Xiao Sheng's stomach to survive.

29
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.140
As long as you can understand it

30
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.680
Yes, it's for your own good

31
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.280
Do you want to be a security guard?

32
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.260
I can also arrange other work

33
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.100
Anyway, you have to keep distance from Mr. Su from now on.

34
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.520
There is that woman who is super married

35
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.720
You must never have any more compliments with him.

36
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.760
Did you hear that?

37
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.300
especially tonight

38
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.700
Your room card has been handed in and lost.

39
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.040
Then go home quickly

40
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.480
Stop being so obscene here

41
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.040
Don't wait for him here

42
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.870
Is there anything else?

43
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.520
What did your mother say?

44
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.160
I'm leaving first

45
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.600
What are you in a hurry for?

46
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.580
I feel wronged by you being with me again.

47
00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.780
I'm not grandpa

48
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.340
I want to see you tomorrow when I harvest leaves

49
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.140
You finished thinking for me

50
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.860
non-temporal experience

51
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.420
Grandpa talking to you here

52
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.340
When I was making leek soup

53
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.240
Help yourself to the past

54
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.080
Now he's got a hard pussy

55
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.270
I'll go there tomorrow

56
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.530
No need to support him

57
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.000
Wrong, master already

58
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.060
Arranged for my grandpa

59
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.340
The world's most urgent impact

60
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.800
Just check on him tomorrow

61
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.390
Old man, these two days

62
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.550
Please read your words

63
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.730
Arrive on time tomorrow. Come on first.

64
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.530
Where are you going first?

65
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.690
Wash the dishes and fish early

66
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.680
I don’t have the room card given by my female sister.

67
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.610
You don't want to
