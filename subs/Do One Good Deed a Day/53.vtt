00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.140
Not going?

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.190
Meeting your father is a mess, right?

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.950
See you in the new year, we have something to pursue,

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.530
Go to five million, just write me to sell my body,

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.070
Let their family become a circle.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.780
Yes, your two families,

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.020
Go to five million,

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.700
With so much money, why are you asking for help?

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.570
I’ve seen people think that they spend money to hire a beautiful woman.

10
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.330
With a group of sentimental actors, you can pretend again,

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410
I have seen this kind of escape too many times,

12
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.290
Just this fake change,

13
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.290
Calm down, make quick money, change.

14
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.570
But this beauty is pretty good and simple.

15
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.550
I won’t be pornographic for two days. This matter will be closed for a while.

16
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.520
Of course you went to Su University

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.460
don't know me

18
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.480
But I'm not

19
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.519
It’s not that my heart has become big, right?

20
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.490
Please show me clearly

21
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.810
I am Su Zhimeng, President of Suzhi Group, Su Zhimeng, Su Zhimeng

22
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.230
Mr. Su, President of Suzhi Group, gave him

23
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.930
Shopping in front of a planning project

24
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.430
When I'm a fool

25
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.630
Be careful when speaking

26
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.020
This is really Mr. Su

27
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.850
You will meet him again and again

28
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.540
If he loses

29
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.360
I'll call you daddy when I fall asleep

30
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.280
What's wrong with taking turns? I'm afraid.

31
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.860
Isn't that crazy?

32
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.880
Not afraid

33
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.840
I just don’t want a stupid son like you

34
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.000
He can satisfy you

35
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.260
Stop asking me to blow

36
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.060
Are you just saying that he is really a loser?

37
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.520
You guys don't want me to go in

38
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.840
inside

39
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280
Came to participate in my father's karma test

40
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.520
How about losing from the first mate to the master?

41
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.560
Trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble

42
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.080
Trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble trouble

43
