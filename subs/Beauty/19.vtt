00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.590
Didn't you mean that you wanted to use this statement to nominate,

2
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.860
It will shine. Mistress,

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.480
Donâ€™t be too rejuvenating a god,

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.510
Will come its spectators and corpses,

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.780
You will never regret using it, yes,

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.210
If the lights are tight, you will benefit.

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.080
I used to wear a door gown,

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.460
The faster you run, the better,

9
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.990
Let me remember it.

10
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.010
These things are getting smaller and smaller,

11
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.290
Don't commit it.

12
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.170
Don't commit it.

13
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.670
Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.

14
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.150
Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.760
Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.580
Definitely not going out

17
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.450
Why are you coming back? Don't be impatient

18
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.500
My sixth brother and I planned to go to Qingyan Pass

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.360
Tomato Stock Book Unexpectedly

20
00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.099
I met his grandfather upstairs at the office again

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.580
Are you okay? It's okay.

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.150
My sixth brother and I saw something about him

23
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.600
Found this next to him

24
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.000
You didn't wait for me to see this evening

25
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.980
He disappeared

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.620
Afraid that you are in danger

27
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.940
I ran back quickly

28
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.670
This declares you to tell the truth

29
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.430
What on earth did you do?
