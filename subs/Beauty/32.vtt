00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.070
What's impossible?

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.130
Your parents don’t want to be born in the underworld,

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.670
Therefore, he pulls himself away from the enemy and kills him,

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.500
I thought you wouldn't survive Sanri, but I didn't expect that,

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.520
Because that foreskin has moved its mind,

6
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.880
I pulled out his vagina and made a deal with him,

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.680
I hope you grow up safely. Unexpectedly,

8
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.400
In this interlocking conversation, in this matter,

9
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.280
It's all his fault.

10
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.700
What are you going to do? A hundred years ago, you

11
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.340
There is a ninth brother of life and death, this time,

12
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.440
It was he who came to your father's court,

13
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.760
Our plan will always go wrong,

14
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.660
raise you up,

15
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.430
Wait until he finds something to show his affection for you

16
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.970
Let you enter Yingfen again

17
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.370
Sand him again

18
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.830
But who would have thought that you would be afraid of ruining it?

19
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.960
This favor is all based on flesh and blood.

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.960
We have been dependent on each other for these eighteen years

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.020
I won't let you send this

22
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.450
We will definitely find a way, grandpa

23
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.190
It's really not possible

24
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.090
I'll go and make plans with him

25
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.050
There must be something you can do

26
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.600
Chen Xuantian is getting late

27
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.840
You go back and rest, brother

28
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.940
I'm tired too

29
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.280
All rested

30
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.820
For six years

31
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.239
I want to give you this

32
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.980
You need to find someone else for protection

33
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.870
It's you. Have you met my grandfather?

34
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.830
when you crash

35
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.160
It’s not for nothing that you are counterfeiting us

36
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.500
The old man and grandpa went to find him

37
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.720
I know thank you

38
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.550
Bring a small fire

39
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.470
He has been capable for a long time
