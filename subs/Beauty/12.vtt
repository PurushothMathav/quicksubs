00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.260
If you don’t believe it,

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.400
Just try it.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.660
What proof do you have? Your hands are the best proof.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.640
Have you dug into English recently?

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.570
Why are things produced?

6
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.120
I haven't dug it. You haven’t dug it,

7
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.320
That's what people close to you have dug up.

8
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.260
Now, British retribution, on whom of you,

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.580
And if you don’t believe it, you’re just like that dog,

10
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.830
This business is useless to you.

11
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.600
And how to solve it.

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.600
I don’t care if I speak English or German.

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.630
If it fails, you can only accept your fate.

14
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.240
I just put your shoes on.

15
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.960
All is this.

16
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.400
I might as well have sex with him

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.620
Only one person mentions his life

18
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.180
What's the meaning

19
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.760
I think of an immediate solution

20
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.460
Just use a belt to replace you

21
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.020
Take him to the silver cents you dug and he burned them

22
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.860
will succeed

23
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.490
It's that simple

24
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.460
Of course not simple

25
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.560
The messenger must do it in vain

26
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.960
You'll also need your hair and fine toe shoes

27
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.500
Then take him to the dug silver cents

28
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.810
Wouldn't it be illegal to burn it?

29
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.420
I heard that the head is dead

30
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.100
All I have to do is find someone to do it

31
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.500
Of course, I'm looking for Mr. Li. You want to please me?

32
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.800
Didn’t you just listen to who chooses who spends the money?

33
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.640
Do you believe me now or not? I’ll be fine first.

34
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.480
A damn secret

35
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.750
Don’t worry, prepare a secret

36
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.490
Don’t you understand now?

37
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.760
it's all fake
