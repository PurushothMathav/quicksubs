00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.110
Don’t get married at the Poetry Club,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.080
When in danger, everyone goes behind them,

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.380
You know? That’s enough for you to rest assured.

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.360
There are only a few people there all night long,

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.960
I bought the thick mountain in Qingyang block,

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.660
We will definitely not lose this time,

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.580
Call him, I didn’t expect you to come to the door yourself,

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480
Anyway, it’s settled,

9
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.360
Of course it's okay, I won't kill you if I don't go today.

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.620
I will believe it with you,

11
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.140
Anti-crazy, choose the machine,

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.070
I wrote that if I tilt my head, I will harm others and harm them.

13
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.320
The harm is boundless,

14
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.340
retrospection, joke,

15
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.940
Under the streaming version, you don’t even look at you,

16
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.120
Just like a favorite,

17
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.520
Do you want to stay with the clan?

18
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.040
I'm going to hide it in your hand

19
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.950
I don’t know waiter

20
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.740
Leave your life here today

21
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.560
I've looked at them all

22
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.220
Is that tilt of your head done for you?

23
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.330
Hand over the extension and stop thinking about you

24
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.030
At school, he took me to get my extension and live in it.

25
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.310
These are nothing

26
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.840
You bite him, bite him, so and so, little flower

27
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.100
What are you doing, brother?

28
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.850
There are many children behind her

29
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.620
But I can talk to them

30
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.650
They seem to hate this old man

31
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.060
But I can't leave

32
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.690
Our beautiful

33
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.270
He should first be

34
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.200
He once harmed my child

35
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.250
He once wanted to turn into a brat

36
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.020
But it didn't work, I didn't expect it

37
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.260
One of those children's distant marriages was passed down to him

38
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.100
This is British retribution back to the human room

39
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.820
You are going back to the guest room, I am not

40
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.020
I am human now

41
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.760
You killed him

42
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.450
What to do

43
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.150
you are all free

44
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.460
But it was you who shut me down and I called him
