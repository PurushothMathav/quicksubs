00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.940
It’s really unexpected,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.390
There are so many grievances and entanglements between you,

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.220
At the end of the day, you don’t have a police headset,

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.500
Let you forget what the blood jade bead in your hand is.

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.290
Don't be a good boy and break up.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.930
The blood jade beads on your hand were hung by you yourself back then.

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.190
The new bad girl of Qianqun Princess.

8
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.870
Ah, what happened?

9
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.230
It’s okay if you forget, Chen Xue,

10
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.300
You already killed it back then, and you won't let it go,

11
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.310
When you changed your life and raised your soul, I made such a big deal about you,

12
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.130
It’s not for you to give him your life,

13
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.840
Be obedient and give Zhu Zi to me.

14
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.640
You said you can't live in exchange for your life.

15
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.970
Who is it for?

16
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.900
Whose to support?

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.040
I don’t need to know

18
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.610
He is in my praise of Brother Chen’s many years of love.

19
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.810
I promised him something

20
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.950
won't tell you

21
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.540
I won't even tell you

22
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.960
Then I'll go find me by myself

23
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.140
Qianjiu, please be free of charge

24
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.320
I can also give it back to him

25
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.960
Mature, mature, mature, come back soon, it’s me who’s coming

26
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.720
I brought your heart back to maturity

27
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.650
Have you thought about it?

28
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.870
Leave that week behind

29
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.269
Even if your grandfather is dead

30
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.850
We can also take him and return it to your grandfather.

31
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.740
Since you

32
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.320
Please be willing to read it

33
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.590
I don't believe you tuned in.

34
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Don't lose in competition and be fined with alcohol. Thank you
