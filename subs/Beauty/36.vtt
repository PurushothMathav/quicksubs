00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.370
It's like this, I'm the master of hands here,

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.730
Master, are you going to break into this Yangmin City again?

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.450
Someone asked me to come here. I need to learn Yuzhu to save my grandfather.

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.510
Since it’s him, do you know?

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.420
He had been here before we were separated, and it was he who gave me the learning jade beads.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.540
He told me that in ten years, someone will do it again,

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.170
It’s the old man who is so decisive. I can give you the jade beads.

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.890
But you have to wait half again, I need to set him up the day before,

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.780
It's so troublesome to go and live there.

10
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.880
That’s right, it’s too heavy to learn from Yuzhu.

11
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.780
It was the Immortal who asked me to create the setting after the painting with him.

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.520
Also together

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.790
suddenly evicted now

14
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.230
Restore the Grand Master

15
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.850
Will suddenly reflect

16
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.700
So I still took it off.

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760
You can stream it anyway

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.900
gave me a month

19
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.080
Brother Four Seconds Research cut it out

20
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.980
No no

21
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.930
It's me who's interrupting

22
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.600
And my grandpa’s stolen can

23
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.560
It’s almost the same as here

24
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.540
I think it's pretty clear

25
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.970
As long as you don't dislike it

26
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.410
There are still some prisoners in the area

27
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.900
if you don't mind

28
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.140
I'll give you some more

29
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.540
Of course I don't mind, you're right

30
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.980
this town

31
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.820
How could it be

32
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.150
How can I introduce it without any business at all?

33
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.480
I was almost scared to death

34
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.660
Because this is a name for oppressing people

35
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.300
And after going down the mountain

36
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.750
That'll be it

37
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.970
I know this is an oppressive term

38
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.780
I mean what's going on here?

39
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.770
Here is the same two-term Fengxi opera

40
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.040
biological machine

41
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.900
If you withdraw the food from here

42
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.990
You can't get out again. You mean this is

43
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.880
Credentials are destined

44
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.310
Death is inevitable

45
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.290
Kill the rich and die

46
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.860
If I deal with this place

47
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.170
You will live in this apartment

48
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.080
I'm going back to stay tonight, but I can send this to the airport.

49
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.320
If nothing happens

50
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.740
It's better not to talk about it

51
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.880
Don't kill me

52
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.949
If I had known earlier, I shouldn't have had so much water in my body before going to bed. I'm done.

53
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.770
I want to ask

54
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.600
Do you know where the operation is?

55
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.880
I drink well

56
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.830
how's it going

57
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.100
Use a woman with me
