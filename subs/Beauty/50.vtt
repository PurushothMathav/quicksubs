00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.560
In fact, I saw it right in the face that day,

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.430
Big brother, behind you, there is someone who looks similar to you. What?

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.290
He was scared when he was with my brother and you,

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.410
Didn't let me say it.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.490
Is it still there now?

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.110
He hasn't appeared since yesterday.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.040
College, if you see him again in the future,

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.600
Do you have to talk to me? Letâ€™s go,

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.600
College, here we are.

10
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.700
Brother, are we home? Yes,

11
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.780
This will be your home from now on. Do you like it?

12
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.460
Do you like it? Just like it. Brother, I have something else to do.

13
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.320
Go out too and make yourself more afraid, right? Not afraid

14
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.590
Others will be back soon

15
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.900
But he told me not to be careful about leaving half an item behind

16
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.000
Time to find him

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.750
You can save half of it

18
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.360
Go first and save enough

19
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.050
How about this
