1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.600
At that time, Lao Li Tou was attracted to the topic.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.600
He died on the spot, but Wu Laoliu didn't notice and thought he was still alive.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.480
In fact, it was because Old Li Tou had begun to change.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.770
I told them to run away in order to stay,

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.050
Make a deal with him, and this deal is for you,

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.430
So you asked me to make a commitment to marry him,

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.490
Use my support to support him,

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.580
Yes, I won’t retreat,

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.510
What was that? Not long after you were born,

10
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.570
I discovered that your fate is in a hurry,

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.310
Fate wave invites death, I'm afraid you want it early,

12
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.870
It just so happens that he needs someone,

13
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.990
Take his mouthless Korean jade with you

14
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.170
I agreed

15
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.810
Then use blessing

16
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.630
Let him not do the opposite

17
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.010
Support you with silverware

18
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.630
This time I let you live safely to adulthood

19
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.780
in exchange

20
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.360
He will suppress the labor head's silverware

21
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.500
Let him live 18 more years

22
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.920
So what does this have to do with my marriage?

23
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.240
At that time he was afraid that we would be upset and ruined

24
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.460
Just let me write down your birth eight children

25
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.070
I want to settle a ghost with you

26
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.350
But I don't know either

27
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.629
Your real born eight son

28
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.110
Just wrote one without any nonsense

29
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.350
So this marriage

30
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.180
Grandpa who is not established

31
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.480
what do you mean

32
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.350
Maybe you don’t know my birth horoscope?

33
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.870
From the time you understood

34
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.270
I'll tell you

35
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.170
Your parents died long ago

36
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.230
Actually it's because

37
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.910
I don't know who your parents are either.

38
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.930
I will never have a wife or two in my life

39
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.070
Until I saw you on the 18th New Year's Day

40
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.210
I'm desperate

41
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.610
Treat you as a relative in case of emergency

42
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.850
I choose you, don’t blame me

43
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.060
At that time, I thought you wouldn’t survive more than three thousand years.

44
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.480
Besides making a deal with him

45
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.040
I force my grandpa without a suite

46
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.840
Don't say that

47
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.980
How could I blame you

48
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.980
My whole life

49
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.380
They also support themselves

50
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.120
I can only be locked in the prison. I didn't expect it.

51
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.020
He actually came out

52
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.700
I gave you pessimistic customer service back then

53
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.000
It's to protect your immigration

54
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560
Don't let him take away your livelihood

55
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.330
but who knows

56
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.800
You caught his hijab in your dream and turned around

57
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.560
Grandpa at the last origin

58
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.360
Then am I

59
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.830
He can become a bad person with him

60
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.560
Maybe there is another way

61
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.620
What can be done

62
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.540
Someone took my place at that time

63
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.840
Let the smoke you dug out burn before it's gone

64
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.390
Just treat it like a scene

65
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.750
He has me dead

66
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.820
Will give up

67
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.290
you how do you know

68
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.270
mark my words

69
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.870
Never shut up with anyone

70
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.470
Since it’s for Xiaoxuan

71
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.170
Official customer service

72
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.810
Not yet

73
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.430
That woman wants to have sex with him

74
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.670
Let’s go back to the Imperial District

75
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.950
Take the opportunity to kill him

76
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.300
The little Xuanjia still has no ability to protect himself

77
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.860
What should I do if I have an accident?

78
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.540
Then let him get up now

79
00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.840
Finish opening the ancient books

80
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.020
You can't go out until it's over

81
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.130
Close the already deep bloodshed

82
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.530
He can't marry a normal girl anyway

83
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.630
Isn’t it just a Bo Yi Bo or something?
