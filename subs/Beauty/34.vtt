00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.940
What solution?

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.780
Take this and learn the magic of Buddha's hand to press the name and quality seven miles away.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.260
There is a skilled man inside,

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.920
You ask him for his heartfelt message,

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.940
Take him and go negotiate terms with the waist girl.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.980
In exchange for your grandpa, born,

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.840
Isn’t it Guangyang Formation? When did it become a matter of reputation and responsibility?

8
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.500
What I say is that the quality of the name is the quality of the name.

9
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.560
Get your stuff and leave now!

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.390
What do I use this for? Is it something to ensure you don’t get lost?

11
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.830
What is the main meaning of shoe language?

12
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.350
What are you selling again?

13
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.780
At this time, I can only tell you so much about the taste,

14
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.140
This circle, please leave quickly. Within this month,

15
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.620
I guarantee that your grandpa is safe. I am,

16
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.130
It really guarantees that my grandpa is safe and sound.

17
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.310
Until now you still don’t believe me

18
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.150
After all, it was you who killed my grandfather.

19
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.890
Is it normal for me to be pregnant with you?

20
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.770
Didn't expect that

21
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.400
He even told you this, right?

22
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.840
Said I killed him

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.150
that's because of him

24
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.170
Let cool for a few days

25
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.130
suspicion of suspicion

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.940
For a private gift together

27
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.040
Extremely heroic

28
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.060
Destroy people and cast foxes

29
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.180
Difficult to choose books

30
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.400
my grandpa said

31
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.940
At that time, they were just trying to protect themselves

32
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.080
Who chose this knot?

33
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.660
Are you sure you still want to argue with me about this?

34
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.910
Don't you dare to jump?

35
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.770
in need

36
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.930
You can go to the pick-up store

37
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.360
In the past three days, we have also

38
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.300
I need some from you

39
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.380
But we are closed

40
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.200
What do you need? I told you

41
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.020
The clothes you have here are beautiful

42
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.030
The little monkey that won’t fall off

43
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.170
It will become clearer and clearer to set the stage with you

44
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.390
Still looking at you
