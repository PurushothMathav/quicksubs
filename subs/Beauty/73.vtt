00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.440
What is the best time to do observation today?

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.850
Go, wait for me to go.

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.530
Well, what do I have to do now?

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.220
I'm going back to deliver something. Wait until I come back after delivering it.

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.340
Can I do it for you again?

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.070
You stinky boy

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.710
How dare you lie to an old man?

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.790
Old teacher's

9
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.340
Then how dare I lie to you?

10
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.960
The main reason why I lied to you is

11
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.710
There is no suitable wood now

12
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.920
The switch in my house is broken again.

13
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.970
Look at this

14
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.120
I'll deliver it to you directly after I'm done.

15
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.210
A good one

16
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.650
Fine old fragrant wood

17
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.130
Is it okay for you to do it?

18
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.900
Don't think I don't know what you are thinking

19
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.090
you're out

20
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.230
Come back without asking

21
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.500
It's easy to talk about it. Let's go.

22
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.760
I can hide in the woods behind me

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.060
We are now happy

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.640
I can't afford that much wood either.

25
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.770
Extremely difficult

26
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.620
I'm looking for someone to help you

27
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.140
I can do it, I can do it, boy

28
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.750
Don't be polite to me

29
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.930
A cow girl wants a big cow

30
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:05.560
Come help me. I'm here.

31
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.810
Didnâ€™t see you anymore

32
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.350
Niu Nu, where is your dad?

33
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.440
Why didn't he come?

34
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.400
My dad dad

35
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.220
He told me that it was inside the lantern dew

36
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.320
Come on, my dad, your dad, take out his brain

37
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.970
We will go to the back mountain soon
