I didn’t expect that there really was a name-pressing array.

2
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.580
Thank you for the day's journey

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.520
It's too late to stop the grass.

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.520
Excuse me, is the Buddha's Hand here?

5
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.080
It's right there. Is there anything good to eat nearby?

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.680
You want to eat here?

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.170
Isn't it possible? It's not impossible. It's rare.

8
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.680
Go down the pagoda and there will be a noodle shop opposite it.

9
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.920
I think it's pretty good. You're welcome to see you.

10
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.570
Okay, yellow eyes and face, what do you want to eat?

11
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.170
A bowl of sheep noodles. Thank you. It’s easy to bring.

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.930
I can’t tell you. History, Sanzongjing, this period

13
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.260
Why do I feel so weird everywhere?

14
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.760
Your Yang Chui Noodles are ready, netizens please. Thank you.

15
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.660
Do my facials taste like yours?

16
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.970
Wait until you are guest workers

17
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.680
Who are you from the book?
