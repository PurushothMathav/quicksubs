00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.580
It’s true. He told me that I haven’t seen you for a long time.

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.860
I didn't think much about it and asked him where he could live as a half-blind person.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.460
He said it would be nice to be three miles behind the mountain

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.100
I went

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.680
No. Instead, you said that Lao Liu would serve you.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.600
If you only look for Yin Shang Xie Xin, he shouldn’t take the initiative to get involved.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.220
What went wrong? Nine Circles

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.480
You drop the mountain and let me see where you are.

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.860
It's okay, but it's better

10
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.460
It’s all over. How could the blood vessels cross into ghosts and sound?

11
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.390
Xiaoxuan talk

12
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.280
What happened to you after we left yesterday?

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.840
No need to dream about that woman anymore

14
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.200
Only then will the number of fat men become less

15
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.390
Match him under the challenge

16
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.120
He asked me to open his hijab first

17
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.550
Then there is no control over him

18
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.230
done in the past

19
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.900
Open his hijab first

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.700
Then he painted the ribs and disappeared.

21
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.430
It's okay if I have sex when I'm scared

22
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.700
Why are you covering his head now?

23
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.300
It's your life when you get up

24
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.519
How on earth could this happen?

25
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.980
Do you still remember

26
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.660
I've let you carry it with me since I was a child

27
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.780
Every fish sins

28
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.940
He is indeed the man of his generation

29
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.370
In exchange for leaving school at my mother's school

30
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.730
I also personally arranged a marriage exchange for you in the next generation.

31
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.620
What a small design, my greatest fate
