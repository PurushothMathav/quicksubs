00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm talking to Tianmu. What are you going to do? Give me some food.

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.130
You don't want to cook food for the second grandma, right?

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.750
You don't mean normal ghost cries

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.450
Did it appear after the death of the second mistress?

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.360
Do you know where the second grandma died?

6
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.860
Okay, it seems to be in the woods behind

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.280
I heard you use trees

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.700
The second grandma was raped by his son

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.300
Mix starving in the woods back there

10
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.750
The woods are not big either

11
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.150
How could he really be starved to death by a mixed bag?

12
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.040
Because I heard his son

13
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.040
Punished his gauntlet

14
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.510
Being caught in the woods behind

15
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.630
So his willingness is in this way

16
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.060
Why is he like this?

17
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.710
When he was alive, he had no money and loved his belly.

18
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.170
Is the second grandmother a simple girl

19
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.090
Also mixed with starvation

20
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.560
God you said that

21
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.700
The second grandmaâ€™s son is also here with Jane.

22
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.980
I forgot

23
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.210
you are not a local

24
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.300
I know it's just right

25
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.740
The second grandma loved to do good deeds during her lifetime

26
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.580
What a good person

27
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.300
I didn't expect to die so early

28
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.080
It's not easy for people in the village to miss him

29
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.280
So I endured it again and again

30
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.330
Unexpectedly, someone died

31
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.860
I just came here to do some practice

32
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.360
I didn't expect it to be a lie

33
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.300
I do know a way

34
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.980
It can eliminate the desire of the second grandma

35
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.459
Tips before quelling the ghost crying here

36
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.820
Do me another favor and say
