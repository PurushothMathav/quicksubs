00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.000
I got it from the Eighteen Clouds,

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.690
Because of Yangxiang and the old story,

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.190
You broke it,

4
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.770
Even if I die, you won't touch me.

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.310
If you die, you will die. If you want a daughter, let me and my grandfather go free.

6
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.070
Let him talk about the sword again, and the emperor brother will have something to do on his way.

7
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.180
Chen Xue, I won’t let you do it to me a second time,

8
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.360
Dad, what, this snow,

9
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:37.330
Don't talk nonsense. He disturbs your mind. Go away quickly.

10
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.340
Dad, what did he mean when he said that just now?

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.890
I don’t know when I killed him,

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.170
You will be born and you will come,

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.820
It didn’t work out for him, but back then I,

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.820
let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him, let him

15
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.600
We just rely on our heads to write it down

16
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.380
Promise a salt marriage for you

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.220
I was really wrong to imitate him.

18
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.480
Maybe it's possible

19
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.000
That expression of his

20
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.950
I don't look like a liar

21
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.790
according to its place

22
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.430
You've burned your office as a substitute

23
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.870
I also used hair and a new head to write Sword Spirit

24
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.460
He served as Xu Rusheng

25
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.170
It makes no difference to you

26
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.590
But he was not satisfied

27
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.770
And he returned the office randomly

28
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.620
Clearly he wants it

29
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.100
Maybe it's you

30
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.300
I promised you a hundred years ago

31
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.640
Just some grudges

32
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.780
Could it be that I really killed him?

33
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420
You used to be a former minister

34
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.640
I don't have time to pay off my leftovers

35
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.520
I'm tired and won't drink

36
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.780
He shouldn't continue to save the industrial grandfather

37
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.040
The fourth division is puzzled

38
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.020
I'll take you back to your room to rest first.

39
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.200
My sixth brother is here

40
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.420
I'm with him

41
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.420
Come up, come up, countermeasures

42
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.490
Mr. Wang

43
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.130
Did you take a break?

44
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.510
We are on our way here

45
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.550
Another room to bake

46
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.680
Grandpa was still suffering from a fever and he asked me

47
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.940
It’s up to you to think of countermeasures and make a good decision

48
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.910
What are you doing?
