00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.200
Very Xuan, why don't you knock on the door when you come out?

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.630
If you have a wife, why don't you come over?

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.310
Did you know? I was killed because of the cheap dinner.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.980
What else do I want to ask you?

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.800
Why did you suddenly disappear?

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.360
I've been looking for you in Muyo for so long

7
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.140
When I came out, I almost missed that fish ghost.

8
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.670
Be careful, you are good at this or that

9
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.640
You turned a corner and disappeared,

10
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.160
When I got down to Muxuan, I saw a messenger,

11
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.040
Heidi cried his head

12
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.120
Impossible, I didn't see anything in Muyo

13
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.720
You announce, please open the door quickly, we will find a solution from now on

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.350
Impossible, I also said,

15
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.880
No one will open the door tonight. You can leave.

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.480
What emperor is

17
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.810
Chen Xuan, please open the door

18
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.030
You have a problem too

19
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.930
If you eat breakfast, he will kill you

20
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.260
I see you have a problem too

21
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.780
How about running fast tonight?

22
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.860
I guess I won't be seriously injured if I don't think about my career. Just go away.

23
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.580
I won't look at you anyway

24
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.440
you will regret it

25
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.410
be willing to observe

26
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.870
Pick whatever you want before chasing each other

27
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.240
i found you

28
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.760
I saw you last night

29
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.640
Your brother will take you there Wang Shenfang

30
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.910
Come back and go

31
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.600
I remember the review

32
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.960
What about you at night?

33
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.050
Why go to Houshan?

34
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.560
It doesn't hurt when you get older

35
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.320
Came again yesterday

36
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.740
Just talk about wishing for heaven

37
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.660
What happened when I became convinced?
