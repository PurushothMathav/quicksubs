00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.540
What do you say?

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.260
Since the land is used to indiscriminately marry each other, it is the environment that resists marriage.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.460
Don't move other girls.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.860
Did you just see her from somewhere?

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.900
Just inside the door?

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.880
So, did you read it wrong?

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.220
Is there nothing else?

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.540
Hasnâ€™t the girl said anything yet?

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.910
What's the word for this?

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.020
To the past. I like this word,

11
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.780
Boy, I'll come and visit you next time.

12
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:07.350
It's Ming Guan, he bought it for himself,

13
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.520
What did I do to you? I left long ago.

14
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.310
Still have to go, see you key escort came in an impression.

15
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.710
So I hid

16
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.800
But you died in an unknown way when you were a child

17
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.110
I am so suspicious of that and so on. Thank you.

18
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.760
Tell me where you went, right?

19
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.980
I'm going to find my grandpa

20
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.800
he is always there

21
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.450
You have to let my grandpa figure it out first.

22
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.690
Can't go anywhere
