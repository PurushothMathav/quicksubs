00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.320
Please have the courage,

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.240
I'm sorry to say that you are my grandson.

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.240
What do you, Old Chengtou and Xiaoxian, want from me?

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.750
Come and practice Buddhism for my grandchildren and their wives.

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.070
They got married after staying at the hotel.

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.720
Don't ask you,

7
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.860
I also heard about the wine.

8
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.110
Some time ago, people in the village were interested in her.

9
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.210
She suffered.

10
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.430
Thank you, Mrs. Wang. However, the hotel still feels a bit strange.

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.150
How about eating for two days?

12
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.930
First class, please come down and help me.

13
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.370
As long as you don't dislike me

14
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.660
To say that my feet are stuffy is like not hating sitting.

15
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.790
I'm going to give you a male revenge

16
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.890
You are responsible for the finances

17
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.960
You stay here to help

18
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.980
Our tree is too small

19
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.590
I'm going to help with the materials for Wu Lao Liu.

20
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.570
tidy up

21
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.410
It's time to help Li Hao back at his place

22
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.190
Then invite the marriage certificate

23
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.910
Everyone is having a good time

24
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.280
Like what's wrong now I don't

25
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.810
Xiaowei has someone

26
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.480
Are you looking carefully at the clothes?

27
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.240
He's pretty scary

28
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.440
Everything has people

29
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.300
Maybe he can really cultivate his life

30
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.490
Wang Po, I’m a little timid, so don’t scare me.

31
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.650
Call people by yourself

32
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.850
Because this way you can feel angry

33
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.410
Wang Po, I beg you

34
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.390
Shall we make clothes with you?

35
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.400
If you want to eat, it will be reduced.

36
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.110
There will be a red cloth on it

37
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.100
It's too long. Who can't give it to me if it's two meters long?

38
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.660
Clothes are for
