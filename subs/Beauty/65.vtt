00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.570
General, is that you?

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.950
It's me, it's really me.

3
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.750
Sorry, okay, you're pretending, what are you looking at here?

4
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.720
Father, you are my whole life,

5
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:42.550
Invite my sinful woman.

6
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.250
Father, I have never been too busy,

7
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.470
Come to me if you have anything to do. I'm talking about your unfailing maleness.

8
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.900
You know it all.

9
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.440
No grass, who is it?

10
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.040
Father. Even so, I will take you,

11
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.950
It's a true feeling.

12
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.730
Regardless of the masses' ranks, I will keep you in check.

13
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.230
In the past three years, you have accounted for a lot,

14
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.060
Everything in this suit.

15
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.980
Let me do my job. First, it is just a matter of tune.

16
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.500
Father. Although I am not,

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.850
But I take your feelings with you.

18
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.590
Regardless of the bottom.

19
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.720
I have deceived Your Majesty

20
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.320
It's better for me to do it with my own hands

21
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.760
Your tribe is guilty of bullying the army

22
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:41.760
The saved brother was dumbfounded

23
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.240
How to harm ghost people

24
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.180
Are you trying not to lose my power?

25
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.710
I blocked the new meaning

26
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.710
Because one day you abandoned this place

27
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.950
I have no choice

28
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.750
After the people of the entire country are blocked,

29
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.840
Don't bother

30
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.400
If you want it

31
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.790
Accurately for several days

32
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.080
That's because I made you stupid with my own hands. Don't you be afraid?

33
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.430
Pre-recognition of leave itself
