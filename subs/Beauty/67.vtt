00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.100
Where is it? You want Guang Ling Zhan inside

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.620
The station has been a bit uneasy lately.

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.820
How do you sleep until the town is fine?

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.780
She should be considered my wife.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.300
Good or not. That’s where the early anger came from.

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.670
Wait. You said this is Guanglingzhan. Yes.

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.410
Do you know where the absurdity is?

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.710
I have to go over and take care of something.

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.920
Ridiculous. This town has not been peaceful recently.

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.500
You. It’s better not to go out at night.

11
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.080
Really? The town has been pretty busy lately.

12
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.900
On the fifth night and early in the morning, there will be the sound of ghosts crying.

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.340
Being hit and jailed

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.480
Or lose your marriage

15
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.920
Otherwise, your life will be lost

16
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.900
It's cold with Li's house

17
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.500
You won’t go out, will you?

18
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.240
What about you?

19
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.380
The young man is so old

20
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.460
Half of the body is in the picture

21
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.400
Just keep rolling

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.800
It's all a trap.

23
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.520
No trap for the little one

24
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.600
Then I will tonight

25
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.270
Just find a place to sleep

26
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.390
Go back tomorrow, okay boy

27
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.090
If you don't trap me

28
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.280
It's better not to go back with me

29
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.750
I also want to worship you deeply. Is that true? Thank you. Goodbye.

30
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.530
Boy got me on the right track

31
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.910
What's that thin thing you're talking about, young man?

32
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.020
I document that the smell of love on your body is very strong in your home.

33
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.500
It's for free, right?

34
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.890
who are you really

35
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.700
I want to ask you to do something for me.

36
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.940
You must not have paid for it

37
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.690
So what's going on?

38
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.710
I want to ask you

39
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.800
What kind of competition do you want me to do?
