00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.980
What's the meaning?

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.460
Let me ask you, there is a god son who avoids the party today

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.880
What did he tell you?

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.780
I first asked him if he had met my grandfather

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.670
He asked if he hadn’t seen grandpa for a long time

6
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.070
That's what he said

7
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.090
Wang Shenzi next door is your Lingqun

8
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.730
Your grandpa is always walking around behind the observation bench.

9
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.810
How could he not have seen grandpa for a long time?

10
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.450
Those people give a good talk

11
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.780
Who is that? Is it grandpa?

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.560
Don't worry, don't mess with Wu Laoliu and Uncle Luantai

13
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.990
Even Grandpa Wu can't harm me

14
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.850
How do you know he's saving you now?

15
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.890
It’s not because I want you to die in the future.

16
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.910
The blood on your body

17
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.290
Just use it to mention their wolf disaster

18
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.360
Che Qinghuai, you will know

19
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.640
He has no intention of using you to bring disaster.

20
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.340
Only I can save you

21
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.840
Then why did you save me?

22
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.610
That's because you're not

23
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.440
mark my words

24
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.900
Never mention it

25
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.200
What are you running around about?

26
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.290
Still drinking coffee and sleeping

27
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.420
Why are you still saving her?

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.700
I'm sleeping on the powder, obviously

29
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.240
No one can go to Houshan Mountain to fight

30
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.580
I just carried you back

31
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.520
Otherwise, you will die and die with your soul.

32
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.920
Slept all day and night

33
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.670
I just exchanged you back
