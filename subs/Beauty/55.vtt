00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.140
Mr. Wu, what are you talking about?

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.520
Weren't you captured together with my father?

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.940
Grandpa is dead!

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.800
I'm here to persuade you this time, right?

5
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.880
Impossible, how could I die?

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.920
It’s dad, he’s pretty good too,

7
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.800
As expected, this blood-breeding animal is now in my hands.

8
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.850
Lost ground, what nonsense are you talking about?

9
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.280
My grandfather and Mr. Wu are brothers.

10
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.960
Grandpa has long been infected with the teacher,

11
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.160
When I was young, my heart was ripe and wrong,

12
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.800
Let the tricks handed over to her by the master go wild and fly away.

13
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.820
Finally, I was moved down the mountain and moved here,

14
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.610
Be strong, be strong, Mr. Wu,

15
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.750
What can you say quickly?

16
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.070
This is a try

17
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.790
Chen Xuan is not so easy to say

18
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.950
Hand over the bloody column

19
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.970
I can spare you from saying goodbye to the old man

20
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.580
I really didn’t kill your grandson.

21
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.770
My old man might

22
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.130
It's just that I was blinded by my waist.

23
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.130
That's why you said that about my grandfather

24
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.400
You all should wake up and stop writing.

25
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.340
I won't believe you Chen Xuan

26
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.140
I'll tell you today

27
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.060
A great name

28
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.260
Do you remember your grandfather’s grandson?

29
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.700
You are not from here either

30
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.100
I already knew this

31
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.680
I am my grandfather's sword from Houshan

32
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.890
No more floating pills

33
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.010
Then do you know that before your grandfather

34
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.430
I complained about a child

35
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.940
But in my teens

36
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.200
Explanation of reasonable words

37
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.970
After Zina, your grandfather got married in Yuyu.

38
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.070
Until he suddenly left eighteen years ago

39
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.670
I've been gone for several months

40
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.650
We always thought he was dead

41
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.950
I also told you this

42
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.520
I couldn’t get along with my husband at that time either.

43
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.440
And brothers

44
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.540
Let's go imprison him together

45
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.750
Go make money

46
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.310
Then did you know that when he comes back?

47
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.230
tell us

48
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.920
You are his handsome boy outside

49
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.200
Analysis of negative-born children

50
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.860
Who doesn't know his handsome son?

51
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.800
long dead

52
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.180
There are no dead bodies

53
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.420
Where can I get the negative analysis from?

54
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.050
Stranger things

55
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.170
The name he gave you

56
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.490
So what if it's a name

57
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.920
That's because

58
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.580
The handsome man he used to be
