00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.840
The relatives' wish was not to let Gu Zhu come out of these homes.

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.340
You can do it, I will turn it into these homes,

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.100
While looking for a home, if I treat myself as a Cang home,

4
00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.390
If he couldn't pass it on to Huang Ning, he would become that chicken.

5
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.030
What casualties cap Wang Li and the government bank.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.190
It was all my fault back then, I paid thousands of balls,

7
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.190
I'm sorry for you, but I guarantee you,

8
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.850
I will definitely not let him down this time, Wan Xing.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.300
You are believing that you will,

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.380
Princess, you are enough to have another meeting, I will run away too much,

11
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.500
I will treat you as well as I will with you.

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.880
Don't worry, when the time comes

13
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.240
I can hold the ball in the conference

14
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.940
Do you want to come to Guanli together?

15
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.190
The two of us won't go

16
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.820
I changed the subject

17
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.040
He has long been unable to let me go.

18
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.320
Ren Rong looks like this now

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.980
we went

20
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.740
It will only make the princess sad

21
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.420
But if he can see Gu Ren

22
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.560
Will you be very touched?

23
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.060
The two of us have already settled on Cheng Xue

24
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.060
We have seen your Chaolu

25
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.260
how do you recover

26
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.780
It will be delivered to your home in front of Guanli.

27
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.830
Higher, higher is better

28
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.150
Brother Chen, why are you here?

29
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.210
I came over to see grandpa

30
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.230
Is there anything you need help with? No, no.

31
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.870
We have enough police here.

32
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.050
You are responsible

33
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.730
Look at Wang Po

34
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.090
Pay once the laundry is done

35
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.950
That's all

36
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.730
We can't afford this money

37
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.110
You'll be fine this time, right?

38
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.500
Thank you for your hard work, everyone

39
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.200
Go, Mrs. Wang
