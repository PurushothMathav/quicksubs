00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.640
What? Who is he burning?

2
00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.410
This is metal

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.810
Okay, Xuechen, I’m leaving

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.600
you have to be careful

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.110
What's wrong with him? Who?

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.340
People are like kings and gods

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.180
Come and talk to me

8
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.920
What did he tell you?

9
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.990
Just chat a few words and become a student

10
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.850
Your courage now

11
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.710
It's quite big

12
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.410
What can be done?

13
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.740
I've pissed him off

14
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.140
What should I do if I take it away? You know

15
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.200
Why can you always go to them?

16
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.930
What are you doing?

17
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.020
This door opens a box

18
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.060
in square numbers

19
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.020
Foot Yin Yang Gate

20
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.520
Where can it be melted?

21
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.880
People from the second year of Yin Yang came in

22
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.180
That's why?

23
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.800
The reason why he can find you

24
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.450
That's right

25
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.040
It's open for business

26
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.420
Come on, why are you kidding me?

27
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.280
Apart from this, tell the truth

28
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.240
I'm afraid of everyone

29
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.940
Since you are afraid

30
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.450
why don't you listen to me

31
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.100
Wait until I'm ready

32
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.560
We are all angry

33
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.120
Guan Cai and the corpse of a woman who came back to sell

34
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.020
How can we harm people if we deal with him?

35
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.040
Actually, I've always been curious

36
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.540
What grudge do you have with him?

37
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.160
Let's drive up

38
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.080
More curious than me, the victim

39
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.020
This has nothing to do with you

40
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.850
as long as you know

41
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.250
As long as I won't harm you

42
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.560
But you didn't say

43
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.740
I generally believe you so much

44
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.660
You told me to be careful

45
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.840
Also with Wang Shencai

46
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.740
They told me to be careful

47
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.970
And the Holy Successor they gave

48
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.970
You can’t rely on much from what you give me.

49
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.720
Just screen I'm still alive

50
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.380
What's the meaning
