00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.500
Don't force me. It's a good thing. Give it to me.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.530
What is it?

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.390
If someone is not a thing, who is it?

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.620
He turns out to be a ruler,

5
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.330
There is no room for this method of scoring three baskets.

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.840
Let me see how many more there are today?

7
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.320
Not much, enough to deal with you.

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.550
This, this, this,

9
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.290
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this,

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.990
This, this, this, this,

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.470
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this ,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this,this

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.610
Quan Da Xueyizhu

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.850
Isn't it good to resurrect the clan you left behind?

14
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.630
Don't take any more hostages.

15
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.370
How can there be so many good things in danger?

16
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.990
What old age, illness and death?

17
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.030
The royal wife of the academic circle

18
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.810
These are the laws of nature

19
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.600
This is like seeking death and seeing through it

20
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.340
You saved the seat again. Thank you.

21
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.570
Didn’t I say that?

22
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.129
It's for your grandfather's sake

23
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.220
What is your relationship with my grandfather?

24
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.030
I've never seen you

25
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.480
you haven't seen me

26
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.200
But I have seen you

27
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.480
Grandpa didn’t know how to raise children at that time

28
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.410
Deliberately writing something new told me

29
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.670
My bad feeling has passed

30
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.310
Said he was willing to raise children with him

31
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.200
In the end, he actually disliked me for something.

32
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.540
But how do you look?

33
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.460
Am I not good-looking? No

34
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.700
You look too young too

35
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.850
My grandfather gave up for half a year

36
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.300
What did you say

37
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.920
You really want to talk

38
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.840
I really like to hear it

39
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.930
But more than ten years ago

40
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.970
You are also one of our five major sects

41
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.230
Famously handsome man

42
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.020
When I saw him

43
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.160
He is broadcasting Hua Zhengmao

44
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.080
After more than ten years of separation

45
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.200
Are you getting old so fast? Tiantian

46
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.700
Of course it's because back then I shouted to stop writing.

47
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.170
Not Gao Zu Laoliu

48
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.940
Shouting a strike can quell the boycott

49
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.640
They started going everywhere

50
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.580
It's a mother's fault. She's missing people.

51
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.020
Came early, stayed a little later for revenge

52
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.960
Just came to Nafu and walked to the river

53
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720
Cui Cui is the one who died

54
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.210
Why, choosing Laokou is a recipe for death?

55
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.230
And you, boy

56
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.320
I never expected it

57
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.440
You can actually get together with Liu Bansha

58
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.630
do you know

59
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.990
In fact, there was no Lao Liu and you back then

60
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.150
No need to die

61
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.580
Liu bansha health

62
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.000
If they want to eat you kill them
