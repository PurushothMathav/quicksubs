00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.550
Dad, what are you doing?

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.380
Nothing done?

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.780
Xiaoxun, you should do it, right?

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.260
I'll cook you some food.

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.440
Well, dad, are you doing enough?

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.560
Okay, what's wrong?

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.520
Really, Dad?

8
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.980
If you don't follow me, I'll burn it for you

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.430
It’s just the wreath of peppers before chasing each other, I think about it no matter what,

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.020
Don't scare me, it's all my fault,

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.650
I didn't make some wreaths, you are no longer here,

12
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.260
One is called Tudanzi,

13
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.780
How do I eat a few chocolates?

14
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.420
I will die for you!

15
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.690
If you ask for something, I won't beat you to death!

16
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.290
So cute

17
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.810
You're not dead

18
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.650
But life is not about

19
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.860
Can't you eat sweets if your blood sugar is high?

20
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.560
I just grew up and didn’t eat more.

21
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.840
You tell me

22
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.520
How did sliding chaos occur in Minato City?

23
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.700
Where are you sleeping?

24
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.120
Now that you have grown the taste

25
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.240
Then I will throw it away for you after you give birth.

26
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.800
When did your blood sugar drop?

27
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.470
Buy it for you again

28
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.460
I have to give it to you

29
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:27.330
Someone is feeling sore down there.

30
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.830
That's your son Wang Shen, his son Qifang

31
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.010
What happened yesterday?

32
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.820
Today I'll run away and kick Shaotian

33
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.080
That kick is still

34
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.450
Did Lao Li Tou kill him before he was alive? The royal family had already

35
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.580
I woke up yesterday and saw you hadn’t come back

36
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.840
I still found my whereabouts

37
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.120
Whose first-line royal prince?

38
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.000
I went there to eat a few days ago.

39
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.320
You just came back strong

40
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.360
You probably don’t know yet, grandpa?

41
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.760
But my whereabouts yesterday

42
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.940
I also met the royal family early

43
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.630
It's impossible to say anything back to her
