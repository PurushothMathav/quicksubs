00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.460
Grandpa's old tiles were nothing more than what he could learn.

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.540
God didn't lie to you. Just ask the people in the village and you will know.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.500
He didn't call you sideways, but at the same time he was calling for the soul of his dead Wazi.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.240
I dream that one day he will come back and learn for you. You are so pitiful and pathetic.

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.430
I don't believe you. Stop laughing.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.910
If it weren't for your grandfather having other ideas

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.980
How could I choose this name for you? How could it make you and that woman calm down?

8
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.900
This life is really a joke, I will accompany you

9
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.080
This old man with a blue mouth and a round mouth

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.940
I don't believe it

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.200
Follow me to meet my grandpa

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.960
I will ask her personally how I am

13
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.700
Then go down and ask her.

14
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.040
Even if you die

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.100
My grandpa wonâ€™t die either

16
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.050
Why do you want her?

17
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.910
Just say that I live

18
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.110
Someone else's ran away

19
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.710
You call someone

20
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.150
I really only have some left to kill you and you

21
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.060
The children of both adults are here.

22
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.740
I've been following you secretly

23
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.360
Now I think you're in a bit of danger

24
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.060
I'll come out

25
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.560
Grandpa, I saw your grandson

26
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.340
He has always been afraid

27
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.300
That was all behind my back at that time

28
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.440
How could he still vomit?

29
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.180
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right

30
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.130
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
