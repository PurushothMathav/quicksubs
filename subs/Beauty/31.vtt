00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.110
It suits you, yes,

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.070
You kid is a little careless.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.530
He was the one who killed us back then.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.870
Speaking of which, we are confused and should not decide.

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.040
When he was an official in Qingyang, he was not a brother yet.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.880
I am afraid that instead of being brothers, we will become brothers.

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.020
I'm afraid that we will buy it in the back of Qingyangguan.

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.460
Unexpectedly, this matter made my junior brother,

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.840
The days are long and the master's hand is gone.

10
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.290
Later, Youzhongzhong came to his senses.

11
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.930
Fortunately we retaliate.

12
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.690
From then on, he disappeared in the village,

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.770
Unexpectedly.

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.590
He quarreled with you again

15
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.080
Why did he want to harm you? These things?

16
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.940
In fact, it's also our fault

17
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.290
Back then, we were just trying to protect ourselves.

18
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.570
Just a drum kit

19
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.630
We didn't kill anyone

20
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.170
Why are you talking so deeply to us?

21
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.090
Met me before

22
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.370
The body of the disabled rider

23
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.900
You just wrote

24
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.040
There is Sun Jing

25
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.240
We also made our own choices

26
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.140
You asked me before

27
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.780
did you kill him

28
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.080
Now I tell you that I know it, do you know it?

29
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.250
Anchu, where did we meet you?

30
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.420
I heard it said before that it was from the back up and then up.

31
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.810
Then think carefully about it

32
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.530
Where is the back part?

33
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.510
After that, tens of thousands of people did it, and the soldiers swirled.

34
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.560
Letâ€™s see you in the UK

35
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.180
this is impossible
