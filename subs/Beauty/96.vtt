00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.640
The master said it was impossible.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.580
That's right. I mean just in case,

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.560
One day I will give out 10,000 yuan, and Shi Yue will leave my grandfather to take care of him.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.290
But my grandfather is also old.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.780
In case he arrives,

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.940
Shiyue still needs you to take care of her.

7
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.770
Brother Chengxiong, why did you pay 10,000?

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.620
You can definitely make it into the panel.

9
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.800
Master Chengxiong, nothing happened to you really.

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.840
You can rest assured to tell me, I will definitely enter the power.

11
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.940
Really, but just promise me.

12
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.730
I promise you, who has been suppressing civil affairs for so long?

13
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.500
If you are really not here, I will definitely take care of you.

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.950
Okay, that's fine, but the guest room is over here, I'll take you there. This announcement is before the ball

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.620
why are you here

16
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.680
I'm here to demonstrate

17
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.620
do you have any regrets

18
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.740
if you regret

19
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.120
tell me now

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.500
Of course not

21
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.710
Why do you ask that?

22
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.360
Can you really let go of your words?

23
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.470
your friends

24
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.100
Everything wonderful about this time

25
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.720
Will resurrect together

26
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.420
I owe you this

27
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.570
Things I posted

28
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.690
Never give a quote

29
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.380
you finally got up

30
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.030
How old is it that you still have to rely on it?

31
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.180
so tired

32
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.530
I also had a dream, right?

33
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.420
One hundred thousand, hurry up and go to Grandpa Wang Boqiu

34
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.370
Hurry up from Wang Bojia's clothes store

35
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.330
A little weird

36
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.650
Look at the price, Li Ya

37
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.910
I kind of need to make sure.

38
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.310
You eat first
