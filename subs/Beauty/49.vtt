00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.510
What? Are you so afraid of me?

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.770
Then don't be afraid of the reputation of this girl who has broken shoes everywhere.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.620
It's different.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.770
Don’t worry, I’m living in the superior rain now,

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.290
I can't kill you, I will know when the time comes.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.800
The alliance has been kept in the dark for so long, and it is about to fall into the trap.

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.260
I have to remind you.

8
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.660
Injured, there is death, injured to death, you saved me,

9
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.200
I haven't even got to mention thank you.

10
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.430
Chengxuan, you are so willing and ruthless,

11
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.580
I really deserve to be questioned by a thousand swords,

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.580
It's also very good, you can live in it after you get it,

13
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.270
Su Su did my homework and returned Xu Yuzhu to me,

14
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.930
So can you. Of course I will let go.

15
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.220
how do we know

16
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.590
I came here to continue my relationship with Lord Chen Xue, as I said

17
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.350
I've been watching

18
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.590
But that old man who lives in chaos in Hong Kong

19
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.150
Don't think she is a good person

20
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.430
I tell you to stop

21
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.600
That was last time

22
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.000
Study and live in this river treasure

23
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.020
You mentioned something special

24
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.180
Cutting knots cannot control her directly

25
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.100
I remember

26
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.000
On the street with brother Rang

27
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.680
I will want you October

28
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.210
Remember what I said to you

29
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.400
Outside from now on

30
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.160
Surely it can’t be countered? But?

31
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.270
Then we'll leave first

32
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.120
It's fate to meet my brother

33
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.880
Damn, can I still come back?

34
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.380
sure

35
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.620
Wait until the New Year

36
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.560
We can also come to her to eat at her brother's feet

37
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.680
so good to me

38
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.960
I decided

39
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.420
I want to tell you a secret

40
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.080
what secret
