00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.750
I'm not allowed to press the button. You're just a repairman. Please open the door for me!

2
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.640
This kind of grass is only knocked by people, who, early in the morning?

3
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.240
Who are you trying to cultivate your hands with? Are you thinking about this little brat?

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.540
You can't be nice, you?

5
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.200
say what?

6
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.570
Me, you talk back to me!

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.580
Never mind my cute mouth, what is Bu Daying talking about?

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.550
Let go, when will you be respected enough to walk away, and your feet will change?

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.740
I sent him away for a week, and Guiguizuizi just came back last night.

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.680
Where have you been?

11
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.360
I went to Lingzheng and I had something wrong. What happened?

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.310
Ling Zheng, when I went to Ling Zheng for a while two days ago,

13
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.430
Why didn't I see you?

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.120
That means we didn't go there alone as a joke.

15
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.600
Our brother is more like Guangling Town

16
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.200
Where else can you go to me?

17
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.940
I think you are new to this class?

18
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.260
I would sing yesterday after you came back secretly

19
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.330
Dear fighting dog

20
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.230
It’s about grasping whether it’s better to sell something or not.

21
00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.530
Who doesn't know that Liu sold it for more than ten years and was ready?

22
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.700
The village is only eight years old

23
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.900
Why are you so new to contact?

24
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.980
You are an undesirable person.

25
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.340
It's said to be a heavy one

26
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980
It’s because of your heavy karma
