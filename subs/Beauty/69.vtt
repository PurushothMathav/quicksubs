00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.980
What do you mean?

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.000
The town began to feel uneasy, due to Er'an'an's death.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.520
I cry in the town every day, wishing for a special Lord,

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.140
Even though many people came here to practice the method, it was of no use.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.200
There was nothing we could do, we didn't even dare to go out at night.

6
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.120
Die. Then what happened to me last night,

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.720
Big brother, listen to my advice and take advantage of the fact that there is nothing else to do now.

8
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.660
Run quickly. Good, willing, good,

9
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.520
Maybe it's nothing. I can't leave anymore.

10
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.620
Right. Do you know where the Huangmiao is in your town?

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.460
I have to go over there, Huang Miao, to save you alone.

12
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.210
Yes, what's going on? I heard the old man in the village say,

13
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.590
That Miao has been comfortable since the beginning of the family,

14
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.910
Something happened.

15
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.730
Where did someone enter in the past half month?

16
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.490
I can always hear stories from women

17
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.870
Ju Shu that Miao Lin

18
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.910
one cries

19
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.450
I'm crying with something invisible inside, I know thank you

20
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.890
I said, why don't you stop circling?

21
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.820
Why did you suddenly blackmail me, young man?

22
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.340
This side is not surprising

23
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.300
He also sent you to show up for him

24
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.370
I heard from the old man that if you want to eat, you can eat it. Please give me a tip.

25
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.510
I have to solve it for you today

26
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.940
Have you ever heard a saying

27
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.410
What a saying?

28
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.830
One person is not perfect

29
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.210
The two of them donâ€™t look at the scenery

30
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.430
No one will tell you anymore

31
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.410
what do you mean

32
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.110
If you break the law, you will die.

33
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:52.100
Don't believe this fresh
