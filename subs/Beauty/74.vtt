00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.190
Come fire. Your drama is a bit sticky.

2
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.920
It is a bit unpleasant to use.

3
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.390
I can actually transport this wood back myself.

4
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.740
Don't bother the kids, but this big brother.

5
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.640
There is no reason to let guests suffer.

6
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.660
Niu Niu Daniu, go and help the guests arrange wood.

7
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.349
Everyone else, let's go.

8
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.420
Can you put the wood down at that point?

9
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.270
It's okay kids.

10
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.610
This wood is too heavy.

11
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.110
And it’s crushing you.

12
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.040
No, it’s not even.

13
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.420
What do you mean?

14
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.980
No one is missing.

15
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.720
The two are not on the same page.

16
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.360
Three people are not guaranteed.
