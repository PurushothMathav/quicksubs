00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.890
You don’t have money to eat,

2
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.060
My father ate too much before me, so he put me in the forest at the back of the mountain.

3
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.440
I'm dead, can't you be angry?

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.320
Mom, dad broke it off, dad got angry,

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.940
Ah, grandma was also thrown into the back mountain,

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.100
Later grandma,

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.220
Dad’s head is lowered,

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.420
When I become a lamp, who is your grandma?

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.030
It’s grandma, last night,

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.570
Grandma also lent you my house,

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.020
You are still sleeping in my bed,

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.680
Your grandma is the second grandma,

13
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.520
It’s grandma,

14
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.600
Brother, do you want to stay and play with me? The last one

15
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.000
i can put daddy

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.620
The world will give you light, otherwise

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.200
You can't go to the manager and take the word my dad

18
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.780
Look behind you yourself

19
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.920
That's a show of exchange of affection

20
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.550
I almost gave up on the uncle

21
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.890
thank you

22
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.260
Where do you think you are?

23
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.470
I'm asking you

24
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.380
Come down quickly

25
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.540
you want in something

26
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.570
What's on your side

27
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.480
Didn't you just say that

28
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.520
Do you want me to be careful about that tone?
