00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.816
What are you insulting my daughter like that?

2
00:00:02.816 --> 00:00:05.950
I was wrong. I know I was wrong.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.333
I really know I was wrong.

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.083
Forget it, sister-in-law

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.383
This Yingying has already apologized to you.

6
00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:14.016
Don't be angry.

7
00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:16.133
We are family after all

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.533
Just forgive him

9
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.850
It's not me who decided not to forgive

10
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.016
It's my daughter.

11
00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:22.116
Forgive him.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.883
It is impossible to forgive in this life

13
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.250
Nan Nan

14
00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:27.616
I'm open for business in person and apologize to you.

15
00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.050
You can't forgive him yet

16
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.533
Did you not pay attention to his elders?

17
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.950
Uncle, don't kidnap me morally

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.383
Is he like this now?

19
00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:37.700
It's all because you didn't educate well.

20
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.716
Of course, yeah.

21
00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:41.083
It is not ruled out that his mother did not educate him well.

22
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.616
It has nothing to do with me

23
00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.783
Brother, look at your baby girl

24
00:00:44.783 --> 00:00:45.933
What are you spoiled like?

25
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:46.983
It's lawless.

26
00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:49.116
How dare you speak to me like that?

27
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.850
Zheng Guo

28
00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:54.000
No matter how much you mess around outside all these years

29
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.700
I never cared about you.

30
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.000
What do you want to say?

31
00:00:57.183 --> 00:00:58.533
Don't you forget

32
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:02.333
Before my parents died, they told you to take good care of me

33
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.016
Are you going to teach you a lesson for this little thing?

34
00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:09.016
I dare not violate the hospital of my brothers and parents

35
00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:10.900
That's fine, but

36
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.700
I just promised them to take care of you

37
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.633
Not to be bullied

38
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.016
I didn't promise them to support you for the rest of your life

39
00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:20.850
It's almost 50.

40
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.116
From today onwards

41
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.950
Just resign as vice president

42
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.083
Find yourself a job

43
00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:29.550
What if you can't keep a hukou?
