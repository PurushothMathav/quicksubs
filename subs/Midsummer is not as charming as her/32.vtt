00:00:00.616 --> 00:00:04.016
All girls who just rejected their mother's major

2
00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:07.683
I just had an affair with Nen Mo yesterday

3
00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.416
I just got divorced.

4
00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:11.566
Oh, that's still your love affair.

5
00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:16.716
Then which of you will pick up the plane with me?

6
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.800
I still have something to do in my hospital, and no one touches my phone.

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.650
I'm going to practice the piano later

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.916
I'm afraid I'll be late for the pick-up.

9
00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.200
Poor dinner

10
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.366
Hurry up hurry up

11
00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:28.916
Then you come with me to pick up the plane

12
00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:32.483
I have something to do

13
00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:35.283
What can you do as a social idler?

14
00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:39.050
I'm going, it's up to you

15
00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.966
Sister, don't you think he likes you?

16
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.166
What should I wear for a date alone?

17
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.166
He asked me out so openly

18
00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:00.166
If mom knew you would support me

19
00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:04.666
What am I supposed to wear?

20
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.450
Why don't you have a single dress for a date?

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.250
I want to buy clothes.
