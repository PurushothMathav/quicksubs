00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.983
So what's going on?

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.650
My friend's kids want to see your brother play

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.566
Get him some tickets to deliver

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.866
Friend's child

5
00:00:08.283 --> 00:00:10.550
I'm afraid it's Su Yingying and her concerns

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.566
Second uncle?

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.800
My brother's performances are all public welfare

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.333
All the ticket money has to be donated

9
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.250
They want to see it.

10
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.233
Let them pay for the free one themselves.

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.550
Why are you so busy without asking you to get any tickets?

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.750
Oh, shit

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.050
Sister, hang up the phone

14
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.850
OK

15
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.233
Later, I said it will definitely come again.

16
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.350
No, I have to wait.

17
00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:35.550
I can't stand his mother and baby attacks either. Goodbye

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.850
Is it so exaggerated?

19
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.150
Why don't you hide?

20
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.100
What if I hide from you?

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.533
Miss, here comes Mr. Su

22
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.433
Let him in. Yes

23
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:54.183
Sunan, did you want the ticket I asked you for?

24
00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:59.933
Uncle, I have said that there are no free tickets.

25
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.683
And this is at my house.

26
00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:05.550
It's not good for you to make a scene like this

27
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.966
What the hell is that girl talking to me?

28
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.150
Believe it or not, I will teach you a lesson for your father.

29
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.966
Uncle, this is the Su family

30
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.400
Please be aware of your identity

31
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.083
Dealer, how dare you foster son talk to me like that

32
00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:23.783
When your parents died

33
00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:25.800
If my brother hadn't brought you back

34
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.133
They're already dead outside

35
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.383
To put it bluntly, you are a dog raised by the Su family

36
00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:32.283
Go out go out go out

37
00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:34.133
What right do you have to say that about my brother?

38
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.050
Even if he's not my parents' biological

39
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.566
He is also my father's personal decision to find his family

40
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.283
But your uncle has no money

41
00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:43.283
It depends on my family's dividends every year

42
00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:44.400
You should not

43
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.283
Do you want to please my big brother?

44
00:01:46.283 --> 00:01:50.000
Otherwise, be careful, he will cut off your money, hey.

45
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.050
Little girl, turn your elbows out

46
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.900
Never mind.

47
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:56.666
I'm too lazy to care about you uneducated girl

48
00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:00.833
Hey, I took those tickets, you, you

49
00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:03.466
How can my father still have such a brother?

50
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:04.900
Just robbers

51
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.350
Hurt with you
