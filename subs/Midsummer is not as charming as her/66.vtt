00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.816
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:04.866
Who let you in?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.333
Auntie can't come today for something

4
00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:09.933
I said I wanted to make you a meal

5
00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.233
Auntie will give you the key.

6
00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:13.166
Don't think I'll marry you like this

7
00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:15.166
You are worthless now

8
00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.883
Not even that bitch Sunan

9
00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:19.566
Speaking of Sunan

10
00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:22.583
Do you know who he is?

11
00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:23.966
What identity?

12
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.783
Isn't it the plaything of the three young masters of the Su family?

13
00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:27.966
Brother Ruichen

14
00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:32.383
I found that Sunan has a saying that is quite right

15
00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:35.916
What are you talking about? You are so stupid and disgusting.

16
00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:37.716
Of course it's a compliment

17
00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:41.750
Actually, I'm also running errands for people today

18
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.416
What the hell are you playing?

19
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.566
Is this a letter from my cousin to you?

20
00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:52.766
The letter that Miss Su wrote to me?

21
00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.183
That's right, my cousin said

22
00:00:56.183 --> 00:00:58.866
Last time he had a shocking article with you at the Su family

23
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.416
I miss you

24
00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:02.850
If you are also interested in him

25
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.216
Buy the land in the eastern suburbs

26
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.350
As a dowry

27
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.933
Unexpectedly, I just went to the Su family last time.

28
00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:10.216
Didn't even get in

29
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.216
Just because Miss Su saw it

30
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.683
There we go.

31
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.783
You took the Su family one step further

32
00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:20.416
But my cousin said

33
00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:23.883
I want you to take a picture of the land in the eastern suburbs as a betrothal gift

34
00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.083
Sleep as a brother

35
00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:27.050
Do you have any money?

36
00:01:27.516 --> 00:01:28.966
Isn't it just money?

37
00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:33.033
Hello

38
00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:35.216
Go to the bank to borrow 50 million

39
00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:37.166
If the bank refuses to lend

40
00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:39.716
I mortgaged the house company

41
00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:43.366
I must take this land in the eastern suburbs
