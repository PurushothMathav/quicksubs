00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.883
The ugly girl surnamed Su pedals three boats

2
00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:04.083
Drainage star cheated

3
00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.133
I heard you're an old man's slut

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.400
This time, let our brother be deceived by you

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.316
Immediately send someone to remove the hot search

6
00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.033
All rumors

7
00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.516
Those who transferred offenders were sent green letters by them

8
00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:15.400
Yes, you are Su Mingcheng's fans, that's right.

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.783
But this matter has nothing to do with our family name brother

10
00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:19.400
We simply don't like your face.

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.000
To win

12
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.883
Don't even think about using this to pay back our brother.

13
00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:23.666
Do you know who I am?

14
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.266
It's just being a father

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.216
Hello third brother and sister

16
00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.666
We're hot

17
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.400
Don't worry, I'll fix this right away.

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.833
It's too late.

19
00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:40.233
Your fans are joining to investigate the vegetable industry

20
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.616
Fortunately, there is a big brother

21
00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:42.766
I'm sorry, sister.

22
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.316
I take them to apologize to you.

23
00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:46.366
This is the sound of the early morning

24
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.766
I listen to Ge Ge's broadcast every night and go to bed

25
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.983
This is the sound of his voice.

26
00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.800
Sorry, I didn't know you were your sister.

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500
I'm sorry, please don't tell Ming Chen.

28
00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:55.833
I know the leader of the backyard regiment

29
00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.266
You told me he'd be angry. Help him up.

30
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.800
So do you forgive us? To be honest

31
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.166
What about your mistake? It's not a big deal.

32
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.533
It's hard to say forgive

33
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.183
It's just me.

34
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.800
Always small-minded

35
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.416
So I returned it the same way
