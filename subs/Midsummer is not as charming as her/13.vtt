00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.650
Why don't I know?

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.883
It's what our family doesn't want.

3
00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:04.566
Bullying you powerful

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.200
That's not bullying, is it?

5
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.383
It's too easy for me to break one of his hands

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.650
Somebody drag them all out

7
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.300
Don't set foot in here again

8
00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:18.300
son

9
00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:20.500
Thank you for being Lan Zhan's bitch

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.366
He offended the losers himself

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.483
You are punished by them

12
00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:25.750
Should have found someone to kill his brother long ago

13
00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:27.100
What should I do now?

14
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.333
If you offend the Su family, we will not exterminate the door, right?

15
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.483
It's hard to march

16
00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:32.200
Don't live the hard days of the past

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.150
Shut up!

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.933
The Gu family can achieve today

19
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.750
They all rely on the West Lake to work hard

20
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.166
Won't let anyone destroy him

21
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.133
Even if that bitch Sunan gives me money to start a company

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.850
How can I get on my way?

23
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.383
Don't blame you.

24
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100
Mom, call your mom

25
00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:48.000
Let no one nest up in front of him, Young Master Su

26
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.800
He's done this to you

27
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.383
Are we still begging him to hit you?

28
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.583
Can our family protect women's insurance only by virtue of the country?

29
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.250
You have to rely on the Su family

30
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.383
One day I will replace them

31
00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.750
It's not too late to scrap
