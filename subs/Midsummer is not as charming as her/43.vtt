00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:03.433
Brother Su Third Young Master really agreed to join us

2
00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:05.433
It's true, it seems you guessed right

3
00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:07.866
Su San Shao invited special guests this time

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.300
It should be Su Yingying

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.466
otherwise

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.950
I don't want to rush to see them right after the show

7
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.816
What a pity!

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.333
If it was Miss Su who invited us

9
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.033
Brother, you can take the opportunity to take him down

10
00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:20.633
And I can also be one step closer to Su San Shao

11
00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:20.950
But

12
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.766
Although it is a pity that she is not the real Miss Su family

13
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.016
As long as Sunan doesn't suggest it himself, it's fine.

14
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.466
No matter who is invited

15
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.500
Stronger than that bitch Sunan

16
00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:32.050
This time, Miss Su

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.366
Sooner or later it has to be in my pocket

18
00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.233
All I meet are self-feeding talents

19
00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.000
I don't understand that Su Shao is not rich

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.150
We met at the party

21
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.750
at that time

22
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.050
You three young masters may have some misunderstandings about me.

23
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.066
I'm here to apologize to you today.

24
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.400
If there's anything you want to know, just ask me.

25
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.266
I'll tell you.

26
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.633
I heard the reason why you divorced Sunan

27
00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:53.866
It's because he's from a bad family

28
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.116
There is indeed a reason for this

29
00:00:55.116 --> 00:00:55.833
To tell the truth,

30
00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:57.733
The real reason why I divorced Sunan

31
00:00:58.033 --> 00:00:59.300
It's him who lies

32
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.050
Laughter doesn't change his marital affair

33
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.916
That's right, he loves vanity and corruption

34
00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:06.000
He slept with a man?

35
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.900
And there are countless large sums of money

36
00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.550
Even the butler of your Su family

37
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.833
Also his skirt minister

38
00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.550
It's really easy.

39
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.400
I can't stand it. I just divorced him

40
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.266
But why have I heard of it and never experienced it?

41
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.016
It all depends on your sorry heart

42
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.516
Su Shao's income depends entirely on himself

43
00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.433
If anyone can help

44
00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:26.066
That has to be the thinking master in your hall

45
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.433
Lord, Sunan is just a stall

46
00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:30.066
As if he did it?

47
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.133
I don't even deserve the qualification to win

48
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.366
You say yes.

49
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.266
Ha ha.

50
00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:36.266
Indeed Su Hey

51
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.533
Yingying is just my second uncle's illegitimate daughter

52
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.933
Sunan reminds what is really on fire
