00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.716
Really? Can you really save my daughter?

2
00:00:02.716 --> 00:00:05.400
I am the senior brother of the divine doctor

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.666
As long as I do it, it will be fine.

4
00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:08.366
Doctor

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.200
Hurry up and take whatever you want in to rescue my daughter

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.166
Where is the noodle?

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.516
Come with me, wait a minute.

8
00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:14.600
What are you doing?

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.983
My second brother said

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.166
Before he came

11
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.466
No one is allowed in the operating room

12
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.700
Who is your second brother?

13
00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:24.133
Doctor Shen said that Song Mingyue

14
00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.916
Sunan Shenming Guan Tian

15
00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:29.566
It's about time.

16
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.216
You're still bragging

17
00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:33.433
My second brother can't even call me

18
00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.800
What's more, you are a human being who can be convinced

19
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.300
Dirty slut

20
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.033
You are the divine doctor

21
00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:40.683
Unattainable

22
00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:43.516
He always has some guys who don't know the sky and the earth

23
00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:44.883
Pretend to know him

24
00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:46.283
As his fellow senior brother

25
00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:48.266
But I've never heard of him having a sister

26
00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:50.283
Bitch, you want to kill my mother, don't you?

27
00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.400
Get out of here

28
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.933
Don't delay my daughter's name

29
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.466
Whoever leaves the money doesn't need you and this bitch

30
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.466
Sunan, wait for the surgery to end

31
00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:01.866
Wait for me.

32
00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.333
No, the patient signed into the atrium
