00:00:03.383 --> 00:00:04.516
What are you both doing?

2
00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:07.766
There is golden sand in my eyes, and you still blow water with me

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.150
This window is not open, where is the wind coming from?

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.516
Why do you care so much?

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.750
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.616
What's the matter, maybe you come to estimate me?

7
00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.066
I will start tomorrow.

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.966
Grandma must be on time

9
00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:21.350
I see. I see.

10
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.700
I won't be late tomorrow. I'm sleepy.

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.816
You go first

12
00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.850
You can't enter my room casually from now on

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.016
Little sister, do you really need me to pick you up?

14
00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:37.300
What if you get lost?

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.183
Come in with us, no

16
00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:41.100
It's all your writing outside

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.800
If you come out, you have to go to the toilet again

18
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.816
Can you send an assistant to pick me up later?

19
00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:47.000
You wait at the door

20
00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:48.783
Yo Sunan

21
00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:50.416
You are so haunted

22
00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.900
How can I meet you everywhere?

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.866
You didn't hear I was coming to the show

24
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.216
Did you come here by chance?

25
00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:57.550
Do you want to look in the mirror in the third party?

26
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.483
How big of a face dare to say such a thing

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.083
Then why are you here?

28
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.550
You don't want to say

29
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.550
Are you here to see Su San Shao's performance?

30
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.283
Is that okay, haha?

31
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.716
Sunan

32
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.583
I say you have to go through your head to brag first

33
00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:13.716
Do you know how much tickets cost for my third brother's performance?

34
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.350
General admission has already sold for seven figures

35
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.883
You poor

36
00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:22.083
Can't even afford the outermost tickets?

37
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.350
That's not necessarily bro

38
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.600
Sister Yingying, don't forget

39
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.500
Sunan's top gifter now is Butler Su Fu

40
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.016
All he had to do was sleep with the old man

41
00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:32.700
Maybe.

42
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.616
Can you really get Su San Shao's ticket?

43
00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:37.300
No matter how powerful a housekeeper is, how powerful can he be?

44
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.250
Our tickets were given by Su San Shao himself

45
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.916
Just three.

46
00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:44.550
Even if Butler Su Fu has the ability to reach the sky

47
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.250
You can't possibly give him a ticket

48
00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:47.916
I really don't have a ticket

49
00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:51.400
Because I don't need this show at all

50
00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:54.966
I was personally invited in by Third Young Master Su, hahaha.

51
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.516
This is the funniest joke I've ever heard

52
00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:58.266
Suna

53
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.583
Don't you still want to say that Su San Shao is your brother?

54
00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:02.183
I'll come to greet you in person later

55
00:02:02.183 --> 00:02:03.850
What's the problem?

56
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:05.216
What are you, Miss Su?

57
00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:06.616
The third young master sent me to pick you up

58
00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:07.650
Come with me, please.
