00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:02.500
Brother, thank you for being hungry.

2
00:00:02.683 --> 00:00:05.250
What does the little sister say? I'm your brother.

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.283
May I help you?

4
00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:07.566
How could brother not come back?

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.100
And then I heard that...

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.200
You were supposed to have a meeting abroad today

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.916
Big brother sent a special plane to pick me up

8
00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:14.766
It will be over by the time he goes.

9
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.200
Well, what about big brother?

10
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.483
He went to buy you a cake

11
00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:19.683
When he said you were in a bad mood

12
00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:22.116
Will eat crape vig cake

13
00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:25.616
He will fall in love more than me and Mingchen

14
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.516
Why are you calling him by his name?

15
00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:28.450
He is our eldest brother.

16
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.250
You really think of him as your big brother

17
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.450
I remember when you were a child, you refused to call him brother

18
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.083
He also said that he must marry him when he grows up

19
00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:39.550
It was a childhood joke.

20
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.166
joke

21
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.700
I'm afraid some people don't think this is a joke

22
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.950
The surgery is over.

23
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.700
I think this kid likes you

24
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.116
What do you think?

25
00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.316
What are you talking about?

26
00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:52.650
Why are you looking at me with this expression?

27
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.483
You went there specifically to buy me a cake

28
00:00:56.483 --> 00:00:58.666
Big problem
