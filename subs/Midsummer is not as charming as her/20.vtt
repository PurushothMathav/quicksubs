00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:01.300
What about this one?

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.066
Do you like the heart of the ocean?

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.733
Just barely

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.100
Worthy of my identity as the eldest lady of the Su family

5
00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:13.050
This is the founder of Eternal Heart.

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.000
Made by hand

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.033
This is the only one in the world that is still barely

8
00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:18.366
Didn't you all say

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.366
Do I deserve the best in the world?

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.333
It's just a necklace, what's so great?

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.900
Ok ok ok

12
00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:25.850
big brother

13
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.133
I heard this necklace means a lifetime of love.

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.100
It's for the person you like.

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.600
It's not suitable for you to give it to me, right?

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.000
No, I think it will work.

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.800
If you think it is inappropriate

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.783
Then I'll take it back.

19
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.766
Since you gave it to me, it's mine.

20
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.050
How can I go back?

21
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.800
The big deal is that you will meet the girl you like in the future

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.900
I'll give it back to him.

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.166
Listen to the eldest lady

24
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.950
Master Su, let's go home, Miss, please

25
00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:58.783
Get off when you get home. Well, I'll go get the flowers first.

26
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.900
Hey, don't you like it?

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.100
Was that a gift from my brother? I can't throw it away, right?

28
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.033
Hello sunan

29
00:01:17.683 --> 00:01:20.433
Let's make a deal tomorrow at 3pm

30
00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:21.700
See you at the coffee shop
