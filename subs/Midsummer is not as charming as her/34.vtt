00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.583
Father and mother arrived

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.200
The year my parents were away

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.200
You keep your facilities so clean

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.650
It seems that you have all grown up Nan Nan

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.000
Mom and Dad brought you gifts from abroad

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.150
I'll see if you like it later.

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.933
Mom and Dad, please continue to rest

8
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.266
I'm ready for dinner tonight

9
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.500
Adults' work is reliable

10
00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:29.700
Okay, hurry up and eat, the food is cold, that's it

11
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.550
No food to eat, come on

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.366
About us

13
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.233
When are you going to tell your parents?

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.966
Still going to hide it from me

15
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.466
Mingzhe Nan Nan

16
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.583
Come over for dinner, come to mom

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.483
Oh, right.

18
00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:53.350
You know

19
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.683
A friend of mine's daughter just came back from abroad.

20
00:00:56.683 --> 00:00:58.183
Why don't I see you?

21
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.933
You should start a family too

22
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:00.933
Drag it down again?

23
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.783
There are few good girls left

24
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.583
Thank you, mom, big brother, no blind date is required.

25
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.166
How can you not have a blind date?

26
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.750
Your brother doesn't have a girlfriend, he has

27
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.066
Big brother has a girlfriend

28
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.350
What am I sitting on?

29
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.733
Big brother has a girlfriend

30
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.950
Why don't I know?

31
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.383
Who are you?

32
00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:19.983
Who is that girl?

33
00:01:20.483 --> 00:01:23.233
Since we are together, we must be responsible.

34
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.033
The whole body has to be on the schedule, Dad

35
00:01:26.283 --> 00:01:27.866
The eight characters haven't been written yet

36
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.066
I just like people

37
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.600
Haven't confessed yet

38
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.400
Then what are you waiting for, son?

39
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.500
Hurry up and tell the girl

40
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.633
Don't worry, he seems to already know

41
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.033
So I'll ask again tonight.
