00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Mom

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.250
Why do you suddenly want me to divorce Ruisheng?

3
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.650
Shut up who is your mother

4
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.133
Don't pee and take pictures of yourself

5
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:06.966
Look at you like this.

6
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.333
The yellow-faced woman who only knows laundry and cooking

7
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.283
Are you worthy of my son?

8
00:00:09.283 --> 00:00:10.650
And haven't you seen the news?

9
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.200
My son got your commendation.

10
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.133
have a successful career

11
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:13.933
Worth over a billion

12
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.733
Even the daughter with the down payment deserves it.

13
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.933
Look, you have been married to our Gu family for so many years

14
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.200
It's the same thing.

15
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.333
This is the face for our family.

16
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.450
But your family was too poor to open the pot at first

17
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.900
It was me who appeared in the hot city to open the company, you give up

18
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.200
Do you have any self-knowledge?

19
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.850
I buy this crap every day.

20
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.766
You still have money to help my son start a company

21
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.333
I'll tell you what.

22
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:31.933
You and my son

23
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.400
Not from the same world at all

24
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.000
I advise you not to be shameless

25
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.683
Hurry up and sign these administrative letters

26
00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:37.783
Get out of the house

27
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.683
Mom, this is what you mean.

28
00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:42.566
I don't believe it.

29
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.250
Ruicheng won't divorce me

30
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100
I want to hear it from him.

31
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.766
How thick-skinned you are!

32
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.750
Survive to see if I don't kill you

33
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:50.933
What's the noise?

34
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.200
Dean, come here

35
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.733
Explain it to mom

36
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.433
You don't want to divorce me, do you?

37
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.183
I was going to give you some toughness

38
00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.200
I never thought you were so shameless

39
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.483
Since you want to ask me

40
00:01:03.483 --> 00:01:05.150
Then I'll tell you.

41
00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:07.000
I brought up the divorce

42
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.783
I have found someone worthy of my life
