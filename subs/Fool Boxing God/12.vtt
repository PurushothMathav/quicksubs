00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.533
Do you think the hair is neat?

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.033
Just to get on that one

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.866
I'm neat. I'm neat.

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.800
This guy is stupid

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.133
Why would this uncle and the martial arts school send a fool here?

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.266
Does this fool have a grudge against him?

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.133
Why is that?

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.100
This is the owner Xiao who came to give us money.

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.000
Open Open

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.900
I press Li Hu

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.600
This kid can't last us

12
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.500
I told you I 200,000

13
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.566
If it's a kid who can last 3 minutes, I lose

14
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.900
You lost my gun

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.700
Take a look inside.

16
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.600
Look at half of me turned out to be a fool

17
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.766
Zhuo Fan

18
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
I want such a person to be my opponent

19
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.066
We also look down on me Lee too much

20
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:37.866
Behu

21
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.800
This is a master personally selected by the small owner

22
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.133
You have to be careful

23
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.166
Be careful of the white in the gutter

24
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.666
Hey, do you compare with your mouth than me?

25
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.966
You will only know who is better

26
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.433
Since you are so confident

27
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.966
Let him hide

28
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.966
Dongdong, as long as your people win, you bet one to ten

29
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.933
Dare to answer

30
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.266
Bet one to ten

31
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.733
What's there to be afraid of?

32
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:03.133
I took it. There's 50,000 for the whole family

33
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.466
Excuse me, this is my bus card.

34
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.866
Don't worry, big bad

35
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.333
Wait until I finish

36
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.566
What conditions do you say? I'll take it.

37
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.033
The conditions are simple

38
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.166
This is a deep thought

39
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.033
No matter the consequences

40
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.900
Why are you afraid?

41
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.400
Or you don't believe it either

42
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.433
That kid

43
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:23.933
Isn't it life and death?

44
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.100
Dude is indeed a desire official

45
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.333
It's life and death

46
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.866
God-sent tricks

47
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.633
In that case

48
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.933
I'll take the life of a fool

49
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.066
Don't talk too much

50
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.466
Who loses and who wins is not necessarily

51
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.733
I'll see.

52
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.866
So let me just say this.

53
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.300
Boiling Night Unlimited to Ultimate Fighting Series

54
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.900
Official start
