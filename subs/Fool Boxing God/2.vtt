00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.766
I was expecting him to report the temperature

2
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.466
Turns out to be a fool

3
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.900
Throw him out after this meal

4
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.400
Brother, how can you do this?

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.466
If you throw it out so big, he's sure to die

6
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.700
What do you say?

7
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.766
How long did we take care of me and not tell you?

8
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.500
We're both about to open the pot and spend money to support him

9
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.333
Right

10
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.700
I seem to have exceeded a little

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.566
But can I have an extra odd job?

12
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.033
By the way, find a way to contact his family

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.433
brother

14
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.200
The taekwondo next door to Langtu kicked people into the gym

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.700
The saber lost everyone

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.266
Are you going to start the overall situation?

17
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.366
These guys

18
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.366
Think of a way to manage the cultural management business and let him fix this

19
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.966
You go too far.

20
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.300
go away

21
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.233
Hahahahahaha

22
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.933
I'm a big tiger, I'll call the police

23
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.300
Beating us is nothing

24
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.600
Our master Xiao He is the most powerful person

25
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.866
Hahahaha economic strength

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.100
It's a black belt I specially invited from Korea

27
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.000
Humph swept through 18 martial arts halls in Jiangcheng

28
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.166
How could your sale be his choice?

29
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.833
Give up the shutdown as soon as possible, hahaha.

30
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.100
Master, I put the door over me

31
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.200
Unknown thing

32
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.233
Brother, let's have a black one
