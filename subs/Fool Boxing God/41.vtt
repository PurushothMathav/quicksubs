1
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.700
fire brigade

2
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.166
Come and clean the martial arts hall for me so early in the morning?

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.766
Kim, get out

4
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.600
We don't welcome dog slaves who worship foreigners here

5
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.366
Whatever you say.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.466
Chen Daoyuan, what do you mean?

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.333
The last time I beat the manager by luck in the early morning

8
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.766
I said I would be back

9
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.633
This time, I came prepared, haha.

10
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.900
Banqilong, let me introduce

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.366
East Island Extreme Flow Karate Master

12
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.233
Known as invincible in nature

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.233
This time I invited him.

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.666
That's to give you face.

15
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.233
Don't be angry

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.666
I don't care if you're in the mood or not

17
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.333
Then you might as well close the door early.

18
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.766
If I say no, I won't fight

19
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.533
Come back another day

20
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.300
Don't call him, hurry up

21
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.700
Ah, don't fight, don't force

22
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.033
As long as you accept my plaque

23
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
Disband your facial features within three days

24
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.900
If you don't have the guts to go to Hong Kong, don't open any martial arts hall

25
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.633
Ah, look at your incompetence

26
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.900
Shame on our elephants

27
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.900
Pay attention to the green mountains you keep, and you are not afraid of running out of firewood.

28
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.366
No, let's spare a few soldiers

29
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.500
It's better to be a dick than to be beaten to death

30
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.733
How can you say such spineless words?

31
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.833
It's not just about martial arts

32
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.266
This is the business of every descendant of Yan Huang

33
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.166
Escape when encountering strong enemies

34
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.200
Are you still a descendant of the dragon?

35
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.100
The sky fell and a tall man stood on it

36
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800
We 500 don't even have a mirror dancer.

37
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.266
And the consumption is already wasted.

38
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.266
You go up or you go up

39
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.500
Sometimes the big eater is

40
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.266
Maybe we can still have a big stomach

41
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.633
What if the big eater is here?

42
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.800
The king must be their opponent

43
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.733
What is the exit to get back?

44
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.566
Others have been bullied to the doorstep

45
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.933
Where else can you retreat to?

46
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:53.466
People should not be arrogant

47
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.733
What am I waiting for?

48
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:58.400
How can the descendants of Yanhuang be bullied by foreigners?

49
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.900
Born to be a hero

50
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.266
Death is also a ghost

51
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:06.833
Curator Jin

52
00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:08.566
This soldier

53
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.866
very excited
