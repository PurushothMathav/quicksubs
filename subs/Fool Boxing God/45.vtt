00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.400
Mr. Makin, lick it

2
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.600
Hero master, are you courting death?

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.366
Come and lick it

4
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.700
King, don't provoke him

5
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.600
It's okay. It's okay.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.033
I'm good, he's not good.

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.666
Don't protect him, deer.

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.900
You can't protect me either

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.600
What is the identity of Mr. Banji?

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.600
Mr. Chicken

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.766
I can't stand it for another me

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.600
Did he fool you to death?

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.500
Non-eye diseases are not taught

14
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.000
Eat now

15
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.300
The king is amazing

16
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.100
Flying dragon in the sky

17
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.800
Is this ancient?

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.866
The famous stunt of Long Fei, the first person of Wu Youth

19
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.000
Flying dragon in the sky

20
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.633
I remember now.

21
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.066
That day, I was playing the North King and participating in an underground boxing match.

22
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.900
I met Gu Haoran from Feilong Picture Books

23
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.966
Gu Haoran used this trick to defeat the king

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.733
He must have learned it then

25
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.033
Coco, he's not broken

26
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.900
Is the dantian broken?

27
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.433
How could he?

28
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.566
How could he perform such a powerful move?

29
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:19.000
It can even create a net-level Sakata building

30
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.833
My master cured him

31
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.100
His dantian and meridians have initially recovered

32
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.566
Legs also grow

33
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.233
North's body recovers

34
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.366
Wait, where did you get the master?

35
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.566
I said goodbye when I was looking for him

36
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.700
Talk about it later
