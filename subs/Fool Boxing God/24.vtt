1
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.166
Can't I?

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.600
What am I watching?

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.200
Gu Haoran was actually kicked black by that fool

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.600
How is that possible?

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.766
He's not funny.

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.266
The big eater king is so powerful

7
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.100
Even Gu Haoran was no match for him

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.033
Unimagined situation

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.200
Gu Haoran underestimated the enemy

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.300
He couldn't have imagined it.

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.100
This fool can be so powerful

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.466
But Gu Haoran can come back

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.166
Getting hit may be a better solution than getting rid of suffering

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.666
So it looks like the big eater has a chance to win?

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.966
I didn't expect a small place like Jiangcheng

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.500
And characters like you

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.566
Now I'm going to get serious.

18
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:41.766
come

19
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.666
Let you see the supreme weapon of the Feilong Martial Arts Hall

20
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.200
Reincarnation hegemony first form

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.166
Vicious Fire Rabbit

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.166
Appeared appeared

23
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.100
This is the unique skill of Fei Long Wuguan

24
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.866
Dragon and Tiger Overlord

25
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
Old man, I'm arrogant.

26
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.466
Haoran Haoran

27
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.200
invincible

28
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.000
Haoran Haoran

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.766
invincible

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.733
That's just the premise.

31
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.633
The game has just started

32
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.366
Let you fool wash your neck and wait for death

33
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.566
Ride a donkey to read the songbook and wait and see
