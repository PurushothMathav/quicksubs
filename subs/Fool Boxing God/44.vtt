00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.066
If I win, you don't have to close the door.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.700
This, this kid without internal ban

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.066
Said he was going to challenge Mr. Banqilong

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.433
King, don't talk nonsense

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.833
It's not that they talk nonsense

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.833
Xiaomei, he said it all

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.400
Try it, don't even think about it.

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.600
He also said what about him

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.600
Then shut down

10
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.600
That man is too strong

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.466
We are no match for him at all

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.166
I only hate myself for being too weak

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.233
He was also branded as a coward by others

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.200
little dragon

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.566
I'm sorry for your ancestral family business

16
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.800
Brother, it's not your fault.

17
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.633
It's all those guys' fault

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.666
Don't drive in the morning, don't hum

19
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.900
A fool tried to stop me too

20
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.700
On Banchillon

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.666
Don't hurt the eater

22
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.300
It's okay if you don't want me to hurt him

23
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.700
Lick my vamp clean

24
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.200
Don't go too far

25
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.266
Did you hear me?

26
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.700
Let you lick Mr. Berchillon's shoes

27
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.866
Can lick his shoes

28
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:11.000
It must be the greatest honor of your life.

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.566
Whose blood are you these two days?

30
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.166
Of course, it's your money for a day, Mr. Qilong.

31
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.966
Oh, Mr. Banqi wants my blood?

32
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.000
How about you, Mr. Banqi?
