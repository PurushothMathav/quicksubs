00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.633
Battle Royale

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.300
Drop a knife!

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.800
All the equipment depends on picking it up.

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.200
Lightly without any living environment

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.333
He actually crushed the weapon with his bare hands

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.666
Is this still human?

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.666
Oh, dear.

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.133
The quality of the weapons dropped on Valkyrie Island varies

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.966
It must be his knife that doesn't work

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.300
It is said that in the airdrop material

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.133
There will be divine weapons made of iron clouds from outside the sky

12
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.200
Hair breakage

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.000
cut iron like mud

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.766
You let him pinch one and try it.

15
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.766
You're right.

16
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.300
Your swordsmanship goes through the cliff

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100
My shield is unbreakable

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.233
Not as good as us

19
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.366
Dry. Dry.

20
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.400
Between struggles

21
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:12.833
selfless
