00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.400
You obviously didn't faint why

2
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.600
I'm talking to you, why don't you resist?

3
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.000
Before I just shouted

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.833
You come to save him

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.933
I shouted so many times just now

6
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.800
No response at all

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.300
What do you mean?

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
Are you playing with me?

9
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.200
Obviously it can't be beaten, I'll tell you the impossible

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.200
I don't even know.

11
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.833
I met him with me today

12
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.900
Come, come, take a look, take a look

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.633
Are you satisfied?

14
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.900
Sorry.

15
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.233
I'm sorry, what's the use, sorry

16
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.066
I'm sorry. Can you 2 million back?

17
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.033
Excuse me, can I return it?

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.066
You're a fucking acid star

19
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.400
roll

20
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.766
I don't want to see you anymore, you go away

21
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.500
Where are you going?

22
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.900
Leave me alone

23
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.566
You come back you come back

24
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.966
When you have no value

25
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.900
It's a cash cow.

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.666
If you lose money, throw it away as a burden

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.600
Just don't die

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.466
14 Bring the big eater back

29
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.633
Heal him at all costs

30
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.400
And make those who abandoned him pay the price
