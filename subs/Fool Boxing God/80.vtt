00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.066
Did Long Fei see it?

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.966
Now I'm holding you down

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.566
What are you struggling with?

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.833
What landing trap?

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.766
Far less than I grind away half a cent

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.466
come in

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.033
Zoom out in front of me

8
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.700
You think I don't exist

9
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.266
thunder

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.566
How are you about to dissipate?

11
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.266
No, you are a crow's mouth

12
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.400
Shut up

13
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:41.500
Who said you would meet crazy people?

14
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.433
So what else do you have?

15
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.566
Actually made it out

16
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.133
Release and refine the sword with fire

17
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.500
Alchemy with gold and iron

18
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.033
Grandmaster and Yu's Sword Refining

19
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.933
No opportunity for yin and yang today

20
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.233
Starry Night

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.900
Refining swords with golden pills

22
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.066
Not today

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.300
Ah!

24
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.566
So threatening

25
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.466
A sword in the sky

26
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.166
OK

27
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:34.500
This sword can open the Heaven's Gate Slash, which is good for your devil body

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.466
Open the door to heaven with one sword

29
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.400
Tianmen will open the advanced jungle

30
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.700
A sword actually opened the gate of heaven

31
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.366
Get the opportunity to soar

32
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.433
Long Fei's once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to soar

33
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.000
Are you flying fast?

34
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.400
No matter how good the fairy world is

35
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:53.000
Without him

36
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.033
What's the point?

37
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.200
Can make you talk like this

38
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.833
Without your care all the way

39
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.400
There is no order to act

40
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.100
Oath made when memory is restored

41
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.700
This Life

42
00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:16.400
I would.
