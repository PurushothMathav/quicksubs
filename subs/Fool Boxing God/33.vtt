1
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.000
Right?

2
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.700
OK

3
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.966
When I woke up, the girl went to the river in winter

4
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.700
Stuck in love

5
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.133
What are you talking about, old man?

6
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.833
I'm just looking for someone

7
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.600
I don't understand.

8
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.966
I also came at your age

9
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.466
Ask what love is in the world

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.266
Direct education of life and death

11
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.266
This underworld

12
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.533
Not if you want to go

13
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.700
If you want to come back, you can come back

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.800
The old man sees that you are talented and smart

15
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.433
Your husband is destined

16
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.166
Study medicine with me

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.400
What are you talking about, sir?

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.466
The person I'm looking for isn't dead yet

19
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.633
I can't find him.

20
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.400
Then why did you throw yourself into the river for treatment?

21
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.933
I'm sorry, I'm too tired.

22
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.566
Accidentally fell

23
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.400
Thank you for your kindness, sir

24
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.200
Cold attack

25
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.066
Right and evil

26
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.266
No kidding

27
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.766
In the future, you will do things, don't go to the horns

28
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.800
Not for one tree

29
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.600
Crooked neck tree

30
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.100
Lost a forest?

31
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.700
You got sicker after you went out

32
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.833
Leave the root of the disease

33
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.900
A lifetime's work.

34
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.900
No way.

35
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm looking for someone who was born to eat fish and was seriously injured

36
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.766
I couldn't leave him alone.

37
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.500
Here I have the final say, listen to me

38
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.966
The little girl of the Chu family pays a visit to Doctor Ping

39
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.800
I implore Doctor Ping to help

40
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.033
Rescue this person
