1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.200
Oh, wake up, wake up.

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.400
That experience was all about mirror dancers.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.200
He is still the undefeated general under the king of big eaters

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.233
Why can't he be a Spiegel dancer?

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.200
It's not that I haven't tried his inner strength at all

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.233
Nothing.

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.833
Does the Spiegel dancer know as soon as he tries it?

8
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.333
The golden veins are broken and the dantian is broken

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.800
He has no inner strength at all

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200
I'm not even a dancer.

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200
How is that possible?

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.100
How did he defeat even the dancers?

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.166
Brother experience, did you read it wrong?

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.366
There can be no mistake.

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.200
His dantian is empty

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.633
No internal strength at all

17
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.466
He defeated experience in his own right.

18
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.333
That king must be born with divine power

19
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.100
You are amazing

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.866
Big eater is awesome

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.600
What's the use of just learning a move?

22
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.066
If you don't practice martial arts, you will end up in vain

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.166
Just wait and see.

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.733
He stopped there.

25
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.366
Don't be rude, okay?

26
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.000
Even if your big eater Dantian is abolished

27
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.533
So what if you can't be a doorman dancer?

28
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.666
You are still no match for him

29
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.566
What are you saying I'm no match for this fool?

30
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.666
Hey, believe it or not?

31
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.466
Sooner or later, I will definitely be better than him

32
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.200
Who is stronger than the king of big eaters can win Jinli

33
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.066
Will you definitely win Jinli in the future?

34
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.133
Is it so hard to admit that others are better than you?

35
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:09.933
Gone

36
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.366
Anyway.

37
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.400
This time I saw the king of the big stomach

38
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.700
That must be a one-in-a-million martial arts genius

39
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.866
We are about to commit

40
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:17.766
Just wait.

41
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.700
Follow you means what else do I mean?

42
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.466
What do we do?

43
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.733
We practice martial arts

44
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.266
So whether it's an underground boxing match or a formal match

45
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.766
I have to take the boss to participate

46
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.166
It just so happens that there is a game underground tonight.

47
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.866
200,000 800,000 so much trust

48
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.600
Is the underground castle very dangerous?

49
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600
Don't let the tour guide go, okay?

50
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.800
The big eater even Jin Li went to the side

51
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.566
Look around

52
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.100
There are not many people in Jiang City who can defeat him

53
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.133
So there were 20 of us in vain.

54
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.966
Why can't it be delivered to us?

55
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.233
But don't worry.

56
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:53.766
really

57
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:54.933
Huh?

58
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.966
This is the Dragon and Tiger Great Return Pill left by the previous owner

59
00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.666
Yes, that's right.

60
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.600
After eating it, you can greatly enhance your physique.

61
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.866
Let you save 10 years of breaking the body's Forbidden City

62
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:05.333
And let your resistance

63
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.700
Reach the level of clarity

64
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.333
brother

65
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:11.133
Are you going to give this medicine to the big eater?

66
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.100
Yes, this is after the big eater is done eating

67
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.933
It's not as easy to get hurt

68
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.200
You can rest assured

69
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.966
Hey.

70
00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:19.200
Follow you to see if he is a fool or an outsider

71
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.633
Such a good thing

72
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.500
This is not

73
00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.200
Oops I know you want this

74
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.000
But I think it's still possible to guard against friends

75
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.500
He can break through the mirror when he runs out

76
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.200
And help me make money

77
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.133
Can you? You can't?

78
00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:31.133
So you start to get down to business

79
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.400
Old Xiao Wang ate this

80
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.433
I have a place to take you tonight

81
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800
So comfortable

82
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.566
Take you to fight like you won today

83
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.666
Is there anything delicious?

84
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.666
As long as you win

85
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.366
You can have anything you want.

86
00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:49.966
Ok, I'm going to play a game.

87
00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:51.433
I want something delicious
