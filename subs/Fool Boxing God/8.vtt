1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.133
true or false?

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.366
That brain doesn't work

3
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.800
You believe what he says

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.866
You don't know if it's true or false.

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Oh king

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.766
Look at this.

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.266
Can you learn it?

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.766
The martial arts moves are all fake

9
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:26.000
I'll try it, Dad, take it easy

10
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.833
Rest assured that the gift is ready

11
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.433
fuck

12
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.166
Brother, did you see it?

13
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.266
Your Majesty, he really learned so much Arhat boxing

14
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.800
Even a fool can become a dancer

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
Then have I not practiced on a dog in the past few years?

16
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.766
Your Majesty, you are amazing, applause

17
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.933
Then take a look.

18
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.433
What level of dancer is he now?

19
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.533
Did you go to the Civil Affairs Bureau?

20
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.133
How do you think civil dancers are easy to find?

21
00:00:59.133 --> 00:00:59.933
It was everywhere.

22
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.900
Dancers are graded into mirrors

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.500
Dark mirror

24
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.866
Innate grandmasters and land gods

25
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.400
Don't look at the mirror dancer is the lowest existence

26
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.833
But there are very few of them.

27
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.233
Like them

28
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.966
It's no problem to fight one hundred casually

29
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:15.966
If there are weapons

30
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.566
It can be hostile for thousands

31
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.366
In ancient times, many famous generals were folk dancers

32
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.833
But the Spiegel dancer

33
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.266
Song Jiangcheng is also the existence of one palm technique

34
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.166
Whether you open your own martial arts hall

35
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.666
Or be someone's bodyguard

36
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.400
Or is it kung fu to become a big family?

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.766
That's a million dollars a year.

38
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.166
If he was a Spiegel dancer

39
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.466
I think I could cut my head off.

40
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.300
Apologize to him.
