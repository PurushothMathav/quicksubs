deer

3
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.033
Who is the deer?

4
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.433
I have investigated

5
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.133
Xiaolu is Xiao He's sister

6
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.033
He was the one who made the big eater king

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.566
Bring it back to Songhe Martial Arts Hall

8
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.833
Can you find the identity information of the big eater king?

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800
I contacted the head of the inspectorate

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.400
Not a single missing person

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.066
Matches the identity of the big eater

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.666
Big eater, who are you?

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.033
I am recording

14
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.100
When you're healed, we'll see the sale

15
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.500
Let's eat something to pad our stomachs first

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.000
Miss Li, your order is ready.

Big stomach king big stomach king

21
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.600
Feed the deer

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.866
Where are you now?

23
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.766
By the river where I first found the king

24
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.100
Did you find him?

25
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.100
Can't find it?

26
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.566
There is no surveillance near the full length of the underground

27
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.200
There's nothing the inspectors can do.

28
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.100
And it got even worse.

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.933
We don't have the big eater's personal information.

30
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.466
There's no way to find out.

31
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.000
Deer, it's too cold outside

32
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.100
You come back first

33
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.100
Shall we think of another way?

34
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.666
It's too late for you to make a fire in the house

35
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.266
I don't know where to starve and be beaten

36
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.400
What am I supposed to do?

37
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.166
But there is no but

38
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.300
I will not go back to the shopkeeper.

39
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.833
Never forgive me

40
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.433
He asked me where you were
