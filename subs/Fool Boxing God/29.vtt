00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:04.000
Brother, why did you leave the king there alone?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.300
How could you do that?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.366
He cost me 50,000

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.766
500,000 got me seriously hurt

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.566
My legs are all wet

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.533
Brother, you clearly know that there is a problem with the king here

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.566
You dragged him to the game like that

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.033
How can you stop on your knees?

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.233
You are my sister

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.733
She is an outsider

11
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.966
Look at my whole body

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.566
It hurts everywhere

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.200
Why are you turning your elbows out?

14
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.466
Do you have to talk to him?

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.200
It's not that the earth is gone, he won't pull it

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.733
If the martial arts hall is gone, he will not shoot.

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.333
Harming the owner like this

18
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.866
And lose so much money

19
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.100
It's good if you don't ask him to lose money, right?

20
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.500
2 Ah, you've been saying this for your whole life

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.466
It's brother

22
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.900
How did you become like this?

23
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.433
Have you forgotten?

24
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.333
That 50,000 dollars

25
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.266
It was obtained by the big eater who defeated Jinli

26
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.366
If not for him

27
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.500
We have long been closed since the back facial features

28
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.100
And those who fight to the death in the ring

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.666
This big eater is not you

30
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.666
He finally defeated Li Hu

31
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.966
That 500,000 in exchange for his life

32
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.166
That 2 million

33
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.533
He just blames the boss for tempting you.

34
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.566
It's you who are overwhelmed by victory

35
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.366
How could you hang it on his head?

36
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.233
But the big eater king himself said he can turn it around

37
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.966
Know Gu Haoran

38
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.133
Don't blame the dragon

39
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.666
Know how good he is

40
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.400
But does the big eater know?

41
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.800
Does he know who Gu Haoran is?

42
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.700
Do you know what Feilong Martial Arts Hall is?

43
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.100
Everyone who knew he lost the city

44
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.600
Did you lose your legs?

45
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.433
Brother, you really

46
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm so disappointed.

47
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.066
Second generation, let's go

48
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.900
Why are you going, old man?

49
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.200
No, why are you looking at me like that?

50
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.000
What are you doing? Find someone
