00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.100
Hey deer

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.700
deer deer

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.766
You know the deer is Buddha Jumps Over the Wall

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.000
Why didn't I see you calling his name when eating Aolong?

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.766
When did he become yours?

6
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.000
He is obviously from our Sun He Martial Arts Hall

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.300
If you really think he's that important

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Why did you leave him on the cold street?

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.266
Begging and Fear

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.766
Just because he lost a game

11
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.400
Existence loses but only wants to corrupt

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.666
From the moment you abandoned him

13
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.866
He will no longer take the initiative to break through

14
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.766
Irrelevant now

15
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.033
He belongs to me, Chu Yunxi

16
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.433
Let me be fair

17
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.500
This girl is looking for this kid

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.033
Frozen for hours in the ice and snow

19
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.200
Tired and falling into the river

20
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.133
Fortunately, Lao Gu passed by there

21
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.466
Otherwise the animal freezes into popsicles

22
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.166
I was going to try my best to find you just now

23
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.633
Luckily you're all here

24
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.466
Otherwise I don't know what to do yet

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.766
Even so

26
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.466
He no longer belongs to this moment

27
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.266
irrelevant

28
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.366
Ding Xuanyi saves a life and defeats the seventh-level auxiliary

29
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.166
Can you please help me in the face of the Chu family?

30
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.333
Yes!

31
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.600
Oh, Mr. Wang

32
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.200
Please save him
