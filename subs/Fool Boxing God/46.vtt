00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.766
What big eater is the cross-border peak?

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.933
Did I hear it right?

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:05.866
That's right.

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.300
When his meridians were broken

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.100
Can defeat the Mirror Stage martial artist

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.600
Now his dantian and meridians have recovered

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.466
It is not surprising that he can defeat the transformation stage

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.500
Who would have thought that he was actually a Realm Transformation Expert?

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.566
I didn't expect that I couldn't hide so much after losing

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.333
The existence of the enemy army

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.066
Even some people in the class are army dancers

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.300
You're doomed.

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.800
Sir, I'm careful

14
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.400
What is this move

15
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.266
Dragon Suppressing Eighteen Palms

16
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.066
The big eater king uses Qiao Feng's classic movements

17
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.000
I am in Emperor Japan

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.166
I have seen the emperor's version of Tianlong Babu many times

19
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.700
How is it?

20
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.900
When he was in good health

21
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.900
We also watched a lot of martial arts movies

22
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.733
Like what laugh rivers and lakes

23
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.766
eagle eagle dragon eight

24
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.266
Zhu Xianxue Zhongjiao Xing

25
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.266
Come wait a minute

26
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.000
Snow Swordsman and Zhu Xian are also counted.
