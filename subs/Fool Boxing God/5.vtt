1
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.633
Broken or one-handed?

2
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.166
What are you fool about?

3
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.166
manager

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.733
He's on a plane?

5
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.866
Can't solve anything?

6
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.200
Was he lucky just now?

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.533
Next move, give me his head

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.733
Thank you for saving me.

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.900
Are you all right?

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.633
You saved my brother, my brother, and we're treating you to a feast

11
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.900
I will satisfy you as much as you want to eat.

12
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.700
Does he have a meal if he wins?

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.800
Then get out of the way

14
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.033
You need to be able to win the experience

15
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.766
I'll treat you to whatever you want.

16
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.466
What do you mean? Don't listen to him!

17
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.266
Go quickly

18
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.100
Beat people to eat

19
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.600
So awesome
