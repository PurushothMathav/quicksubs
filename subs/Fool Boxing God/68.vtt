00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.600
Are you sure this is a pig dragon?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.866
It's still a golden dragon in the sky

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.266
The inner realm is stronger than you

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.433
Shaokun Zhuang

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.200
What I said is true

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.366
The golden dragon

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.433
At least twice as much as me

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.166
The owner's expenses have been dealt with

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.633
Young Curator

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.066
That fool stole our martial arts skills

11
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.033
You mustn't let him go!

12
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.466
What a fool

13
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.200
A fool with high martial arts skills

14
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.800
Stealing from the stunts of our Feilong Martial Arts Hall hurt me

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.666
He was serious.

16
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.966
Hey, Master Gu

17
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.266
What did you say that fool's name was?

18
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.766
I will never forget his name for the rest of my life

19
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.200
Big eater, I knew it.

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.366
Sure enough it was him

21
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.200
This guy is amazing

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200
He only needs to take a look

23
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.300
You can learn the martial arts of others

24
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.100
Just like in the movie

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.566
Do you know where that came from?

26
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.266
I see.

27
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.566
He is the sister of the owner of the martial arts hall before me

28
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.066
Rescued from the river

29
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.400
It was because of him

30
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.466
Kick me out of the martial arts hall

31
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.000
I've been with him my whole life

32
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.000
Fished from the river

33
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.466
Is it really him?

34
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.366
After finishing

35
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.233
Al wanted nothing else in his life

36
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.066
As long as you can help me out of this evil

37
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.833
I, Al, have been

38
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.866
die and give up

39
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.100
He won't see the sun tomorrow

40
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.566
Whether you are or not

41
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.100
Will send you to the west
