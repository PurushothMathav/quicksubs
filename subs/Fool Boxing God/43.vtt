00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.166
Give me less

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.000
This is the sign of our Matsugo Martial Arts Hall

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.766
Holding love, I thought it was loose

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.833
Where did the little beauty of the Crane Martial Arts Hall go?

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.366
Moved the rescuers

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.300
Do you think this fool can save you?

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.233
Don't be silly, deer.

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.966
Sending a martial arts hall can't save it

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.466
This time, Boss Jin invited Dongdao Guoji

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.900
Limited viewership of Kongzhidao Master

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.766
Mr. Anti-Ji

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.866
Mr. Anti-Ji has never been in a hurry in his life

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.100
This kid can fly

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.533
I suggest you don't let him die.

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.700
Which side are you on?

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000
How can you find someone else's confidant to kill yourself as a precaution

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.366
Leave him alone. He's trending conversation right now

18
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.700
Boss Jin can give me glory and wealth

19
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.166
Can you give me money?

20
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.600
What can you give me?

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.866
Let this fool ride on my head

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.100
I have eight lifetimes of blood mold

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.700
Hmm ok al

24
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.400
Just based on your words just now

25
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.866
From now on, you will be responsible for this pipe.

26
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.066
Haha Jiang boss

27
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.066
Thank you for your appreciation.

28
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.400
The invincible Mr. Bench is here

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.466
You think you can go against the wind

30
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.800
Hurry up and give me this flat piece and close the door

31
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.400
Close the door, why close the door?

32
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400
Hey, what the fuck

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.000
I won the game, why didn't I close the door?

34
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.900
What's the matter with you?

35
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.066
If I rob you, you don't have to close the door?
