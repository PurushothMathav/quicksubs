00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.866
You want past lives, you want status.

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.033
I want to get the true biography and become a grandmaster

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.966
I want to be admired by everyone

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.066
This is all your confidants

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.000
But do you know what these things mean to me?

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.833
How tedious it is

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.400
fly

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.733
You look so high

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.533
I really am

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.366
I ask you if you are poor and leave home poor

11
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.600
Next is poor, I said how did you get along so fast

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.266
What does SS mean?

13
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:32.933
I ran away.

14
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.366
His brother, his bones never had a chance to do things

15
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.533
The Receiver Helps the Misguided

16
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.566
More than a disciple

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.400
I just have to deal with me

18
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.866
law of the jungle

19
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.800
This guy?

20
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.500
It's your hospital

21
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.966
Ado Koga

22
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
What do you want?

23
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.633
But keep you around your big belly

24
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.766
It won't happen in front of the whole world

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.266
You never let me go

26
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.400
Otherwise, these two people

27
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.800
Don't remember

28
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.233
Brother, do you know where your friend is?

29
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.966
Go for it.

30
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.400
In front of the world

31
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.900
Beat him hard
