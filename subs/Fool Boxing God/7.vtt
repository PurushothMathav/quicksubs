Eat more

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.066
Sister-in-law treated me badly before.

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.966
I didn't expect you to fail to help me, did you?

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.200
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.500
Uh, I owe you one

You watch my sister come to eat

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Brother, what nonsense are you talking about?

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.700
Obviously, you were too cruel to him before.

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.900
He's not talking to you.

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.300
By the way, what's your name?

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.466
You see, he can eat so much, why don't you call him rice balls?

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.666
Go go go you are the rice ball

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.866
There's food for the whole family.

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.666
What do you call your mouth?

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.800
picky foodies

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.166

Big eater bar

22
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.500
From now on, you can call your sister-in-law

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.400
Hmm, big watch

24
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.666
I see you are also a martial arts practitioner

25
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.300
You can beat Gionee, the mirror dancer

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.433
Are you also a mirror dancer?

27
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.800
And I see that trick you just did

28
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.700
Is it taekwondo?

29
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.333

30
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.266
Brother big stomach king means

31
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.800
I think he learned it from someone on TV.

32
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.800
Watch TV to learn martial arts

33
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.900
Please don't be kidding.

34
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.066
How is that possible?

35
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.800
Everything on TV is fake

36
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.766
Can he learn it at a glance?

37
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.800
Your Majesty, did you learn it after reading it once?
