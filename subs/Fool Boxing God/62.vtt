00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.966
Qin Daoyuan, why are you here?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.466
Well, this isn't some old card. Go out

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.733
How about yours?

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.433
I threw it away too

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.233
Know?

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.766
I have a little grudge with them

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.100
You solve it yourself

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.533
Do not enter the banner of Feilong Martial Arts Hall

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.866
You are pressing

10
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.866
Hey, what you want, what you want

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.066
By the way, your good days are coming to an end

12
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.733
I'm afraid you forgot to give it to the big eater.

13
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.900
Licking shoes and eating paper

14
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.700
Do you want me to help you recall the memories?

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.066
Little girl movie

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.133
Do you still have the heart to jump mountains and want water?

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.866
I can tell you

18
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.700
I have invited three major landscape experts and Chinese collective grandmasters

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.600
Strong humph

20
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.100
Today's call to blood

21
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.466
Your brats are here for the time being

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.200
How dare you buy books to kill people?

23
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.066
You can eat rice indiscriminately, but you can't talk nonsense.

24
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.866
I didn't say I bought books to kill people.

25
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.166
Ah yes, the sword has no eyes

26
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.866
Then you brats

27
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.766
Don't bump yourself into someone else's knife edge

28
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.666
Then you can't blame me.

29
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.566
Does Miss Chu have a way to complete this ultimate bloody battle?

30
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.433
He must have come for Defeat King

31
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.033
Once the ultimate bloodbath begins

32
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.800
Valkyrie to a radius of 300 miles

33
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.500
Haha, that's right.

34
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.300
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.833
You see

36
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.366
Look at the way he opens the altar rags

37
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.800
cockroach
