WEBVTT

1
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.200
Snatch divided

2
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.566
The Undertaker is no match for Guru Longwei at all

3
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.400
Let's congratulate Master Longwei

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.900
Please enter the finals

5
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.900
Ah!

6
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.366
The next showdown

7
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:31.600
There will be Li Changlong, the owner of Feilong Hall, against Feilong Martial Arts Hall

8
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.800
Long Fei

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.333
The black curator is the master of our old school

10
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.400
And Long Fei is our year

11
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.200
Grandmaster representative of the light generation

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.933
Who wins and who loses in this master-disciple showdown?

13
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.300
Let's wait and see.

14
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:48.833
Ah!

15
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.166
I didn't expect it.

16
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.733
You will come to me this way

17
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.466
You are no match for me

18
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.700
Admit defeat, master

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.666
I was treated as a warrior and rose to the challenge

20
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.033
How can you admit defeat easily

21
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.966
This is what you taught me

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.466
Sorry to call me master.

23
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.166
The stupid things you did

24
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.066
today

25
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.900
No mercy

26
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.433
Those were all deliberately designed and framed

27
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.800
Ghost little junior sister two little guesses

28
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.866
like-minded

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.433
Why be honest with him?

30
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.633
You mean the teacher is wrong?

31
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.066
Humph

32
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.800
I saw it with my own eyes that day

33
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.266
How can it be fake

34
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.200
I have proof.

35
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.000
evidence

36
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.900
What tricks are you playing?

37
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.833
Unless you can defeat me head-on

38
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.533
Otherwise it's useless to say anything

39
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.000
partial trust

40
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.166
stubborn

41
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.000
Someone has to break it

42
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.166
You antiques

43
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.100
Specially pull the old era to an end

44
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.033
Don't give me these big words

45
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.466
Wait until you defeat me

46
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:54.566
I show respect

47
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:58.166
I will defeat you head-on with the martial arts you gave me

48
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.200
Use my martial arts to deceive teachers and destroy ancestors

49
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.600
Is this your way of respecting teachers?

50
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.833
I don't want to appear anymore

51
00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.833
Master Li's statue

52
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.166
That famous dragon statue?

53
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.700
What do you see?

54
00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:18.033
I also used his method

55
00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:19.966
Same as the dragon statue

56
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:24.200
Your image seems to be more powerful than the interest gallery

57
00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:25.200
Could it be that

58
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.833
Is this going to be a trick of making blue out of blue?

59
00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.666
Say Lele is yours

60
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.866
As the saying goes, power is afraid of the young

61
00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.300
I'm going to give you three moves

62
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.866
Stupid what did you say

63
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.100
I'll give you three moves

64
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.700
It's not that I look down on you.

65
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.900
But to let you know what is called

66
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.400
Blue is better than blue

67
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.600
Let someone know

68
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.233
Conspiracy is just a sideline

69
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:49.566
Destined to go far

70
00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:50.966
Only upright

71
00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:53.233
The results achieved by one's own strength

72
00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.266
Will be respected by the world
