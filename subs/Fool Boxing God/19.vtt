1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.366
Yes 1 million

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.900
What's more, the next contestant is also a man-machine

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.266
It's none of his business

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.200
Whatever comes next

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.400
Then you will take the money to earn popularity

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.800
Think about it.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.900
What are you considering?

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.033
Do it now!

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.166
Come and sign

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.700
Hey

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.700
Big watch as long as you have the concept of millions

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.833
As long as you win

13
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.233
If you want to eat Australian dragon king crab, I will buy it for you.

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.633
1 million 1 million 1 million 1 million 1 million 1 million

15
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.966
I hit you, what is this Xiao guy doing?

16
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.966
That silly boy has been seriously injured

17
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.500
He wants to let him compete again

18
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.000
The snake swallows the heart

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.300
He has been eaten down by 1 million spring breeze

20
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.833
He won't give up easily

21
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.133
Miss

22
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.866
We can trade 10 million for this fool

23
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.066
Blood is not profitable

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.433
It's useless.

25
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.666
This kid has become his cash cow

26
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.000
Don't talk about 10 million

27
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.766
100 million is just a matter of time

28
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.500
He won't give up easily

29
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.300
It's a pity that this kid's peerless talent in his life

30
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.033
You don't get that in the World Series.

31
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.500
On the contrary, it was quietly unscrupulous in a small place like Jiangcheng

32
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.300
Gu Haoran

33
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.166
Why is he here?

34
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.566
It is said that this Gu Haoran is non-civil and military

35
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.300
The museum remembers the strongest trust after Wu Fei and Long Wei

36
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.500
Become the king of fame at a young age

37
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.233
The former is limitless

38
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:37.700
Some even call him the next Long Fei

39
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.366
He is not worthy of Long Fei, but he is a master of transformation

40
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.366
The youth of the May 5th Contest formed a

41
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.300
The true skills of the younger generation

42
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.466
He wants to be able to operate with flying boxes

43
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.266
Then successfully put it into my hands first

44
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:52.233
Miss

45
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:56.766
Shouldn't the tomboy's next opponent be him?
