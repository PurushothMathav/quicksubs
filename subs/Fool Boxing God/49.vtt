00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.866
Monitor, um, you said

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.533
Are we

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.866
Did you just watch Big Lao Wang being taken away by them?

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.766
Otherwise, I once abandoned him

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.900
He came back to help me regardless of the past

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000
What right do I have to keep him?

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.200
Again

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.500
His strength is now above the transformation realm

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.166
A small Songhe martial arts hall can't keep him

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.633
The capital is the place where the minister of great merit teaches all

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.066
But this one

12
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.866
It's going to be very difficult to see him again

13
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.833
Who said that the deer followed

14
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.600
Maybe when I come back

15
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.766
That's my brother-in-law

16
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.833
Ok ok ok

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.433
There's a girl in paint

18
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.400
Although there is something wrong with his head

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.066
But it's amazing

20
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.966
Hahahaha

21
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.733
What's the matter, brother?

22
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.633
It's okay, the eyes are fine

23
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.633
Don't worry about it. Yeah.

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.000
Xiao He

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.833
Big eater, don't look at me, it's just a one-time thing now

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.466
Wait until I send the Roewe young master to care this time

27
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.200
Officially enter the Feilong Martial Arts Hall

28
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.400
You will regret it in the future

29
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.166
What's wrong with you, big eater?

30
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.033
I have seen

31
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.033
Have you met Long Wei, the young owner of the Flying Dragon Dance Hall?

32
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.000
I guess I've seen it on TV

33
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.600
Not long ago, he won the runner-up in the inspiration competition

34
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.266
I see

35
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.866
I only remember that the champion was Long Fei

36
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.500
The runner-up doesn't really matter

37
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.600
But it was clearly Long Fei who won the championship

38
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.900
How did Longwei become the crown owner?

39
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:37.233
Rumor has it that Long Fei is arrogant after winning the championship

40
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.966
The situation is unbridled

41
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:43.500
In the middle of the night, he tried to unload the spectator bird and was caught on the spot

42
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:47.366
The owner of the museum abolished his martial arts skills very little

43
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.300
Evicted from the Abandoned Dragon Martial Arts Hall

44
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.000
Long Wei also became the young owner

45
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.866
My lady's marriage partner was originally Long Fei

46
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.666
This happened

47
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.566
The marriage also fell on Long Wei

48
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.300
Reduced to night and night singing

49
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.000
Not a good person either

50
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.066
Can I get out of this marriage?

51
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:09.000
It depends on your next performance.

52
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.500
The big eater will definitely do it.

53
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.900
The deer is right hehe
