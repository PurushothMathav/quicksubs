00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Do you know this necklace?

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.300
Well, it's expensive, isn't it?

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.460
I don't know.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.740
My dad told me to give it to you.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.300
I'll help you carry it.

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.500
I also heard that the captain himself went to Paris the night before.

7
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.160
Bought a necklace of the ocean heart at auction

8
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.700
Two hundred million.

9
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.540
Who did you say this was for?

10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.580
Thank you. I love it.

11
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.540
You have to thank my father.

12
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.820
He gave it to you.

13
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.420
Do you know Bach Hun Yeon?

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.380
Looks like the daughter of my former nanny.

15
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.820
Because my heart is not right, like me, without success, my father sent me abroad.

16
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.340
Do you two have good feelings?

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.400
Not familiar.

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.300
What's going on?

19
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.420
You're welcome. Go home for lunch.

20
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.420
What are you doing?

21
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.240
I heard that before I didn't come back, you beat Dung Thien.

22
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.200
Do you know what your name is?

23
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.580
This is called Little Three.

24
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.740
Miss Bai, don't get too involved.

25
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.040
You said you were married to Captain Ip.

26
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.220
Where's the marriage certificate?
