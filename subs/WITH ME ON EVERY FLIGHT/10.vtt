00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.120
Ah.

2
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.680
Love, why are you here?

3
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.160
I know.

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.080
They tricked you into coming in, didn't they?

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.740
Want to hurt us all our lives sweeping the land

6
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.260
If we get caught, we all have to play.

7
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.540
Don't go out!

8
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.680
So what do you do?

9
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.400
What is modest now?

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.900
We can't lose our jobs anyway.

11
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.120
Lam Need

12
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.340
Broke into the captain's office overnight without permission.

13
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.700
Bad Conspiracy

14
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.300
According to the contract

15
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.680
You're fired.

16
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.700
There is also compensation for the company's 500,000 yuan in losses and compensation for liquidated damages.

17
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080
Half a million dollars, you're robbing money.

18
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.360
And I've been tricked into this.

19
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.820
I can't believe you can check the surveillance.

20
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.460
The monitor broke down three days ago.

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.080
Love, can you not let A Phong worry?

22
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.740
The result on office design is too many company secrets

23
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.980
You've been in there all night.

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.860
How can you lose?

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.160
What if he steals company secrets?

26
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.060
Gotta go.

27
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.060
Let me out!
