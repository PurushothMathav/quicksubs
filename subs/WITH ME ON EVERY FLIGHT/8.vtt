1
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.500
Captain Ip

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.220
I'm not Captain Ip.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.540
My name is Zhao Xue Linh.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.660
He won't care about you.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.620
I'll take you back to the interview.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.620
Thank you.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.600
Color has power.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.140
You are polite.

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.520
I don't know if you want to see the back door.

10
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.440
I don't want him to just get married.

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.820
Looks like I have to chase.

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.920
Everybody pay a little attention.

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.320
This is the new intern, Lin Tinh.

14
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.900
People later take care of more.

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.820
Always hated me.

16
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.180
Why ghosts don't melt

17
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.460
You get used to it first.

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.660
Dream, what's wrong with you?

19
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.880
Oh.

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320
Lin Qin clearly did not pass the interview

21
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.820
Maybe it's because he and Chief Zhao have a good relationship.

22
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.740
I admire his charm.

23
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.060
He's this kind of person again.

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.460
The night captain's looking for you.

25
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.660
Why is he looking for me so late?

26
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.520
So who knows?

27
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.860
Maybe he likes you.
