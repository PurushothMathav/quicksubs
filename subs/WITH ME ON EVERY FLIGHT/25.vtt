00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.000
My phone is out of battery.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.060
you call

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.340
He wants to call and see if he can.

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.060
Any dog can be found in front of the old man.

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.820
So he's not busy dying.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.700
When you call, no one will answer you. It's no shame.

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.880
He doesn't really know the old man.

8
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.580
So I'm not going to call for help.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900
Hello friend, the phone number you called has not been answered for the time being.

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.960
Lin Tinh, didn't you say you wanted to call my father-in-law to unlock it?

11
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.900
Why doesn't anyone notice you?

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.060
It's a scam.

13
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.020
I told you how such a person could know the old Ip

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.340
It's funny to think of yourself as a wife-finding performance.

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.500
Is it really the old man's phone?

16
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.740
How is it possible

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.660
What's wrong with my daughter-in-law?
