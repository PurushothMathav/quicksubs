00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.560
Dad.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.900
Oh.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.180
Uncle, are you okay?

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.420
It's okay, it's okay, do you see what the captain looks like?

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.620
Well, it's not very clear, that's good, that's good, come on, come on.

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.920
Let Long Thien change with you to normal clothes.

7
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.380
Don't wear that pilot's shirt.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.640
I'll wait for you at the door.

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.500
Dad, that's really you.

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.520
Give me five minutes.

11
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.480
Hurry up.

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.060
Don't say you're the captain.

13
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.780
My daughter-in-law doesn't like it.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.080
Uncle, I have to go to an interview, where are you going?

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.300
I'll call you a car.

16
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.060
Oh, I have a headache.

17
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.260
Headaches.

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.540
I told you to take a break.

19
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.740
Hell, my secret room.

20
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.280
Dad.

21
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.700
Oh.

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.940
Father son may not be able to.
