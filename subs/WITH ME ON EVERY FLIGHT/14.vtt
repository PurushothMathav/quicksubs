00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.860
Don't look, don't look.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.460
It turns out you're very open.

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.100
All of these photos are there.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.600
What?

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.500
Aren t you posting to impress people?

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.260
Let everyone enjoy.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.120
Ice cream under the same roof for so many years.

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.540
I have a lot of your handles in my hand.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.060
Is the red there?

10
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.480
These pictures were not posted by me.

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.060
Someone's setting me up.

12
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.320
Who believes? These pictures were taken at home.

13
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.020
Other than yourself, who else can have it?

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.500
At home.

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.660
The dream is him.

16
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.540
What happened before was our fault.

17
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.940
But you put up this kind of photo at the airport.

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.660
It discredited the entire airline.

19
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.180
No matter how long the performance protects you.

20
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.740
It's also impossible to ignore the life and death of the entire company.

21
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.680
I'll check everything.

22
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.720
Give it back to me.

23
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.180
Also pay us Qin Lam Airlines an innocent one.

24
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.240
This kind of scandal even thought that Qin Lam could continue to stay.

25
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.780
If I were you

26
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.860
No more faces.

27
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.940
Why not face?

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.800
I'm just a victim.

29
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.480
To be clear, the person who snatched me in a dark mood.

30
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.080
Those of you who are afraid and want to destroy me.

31
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.860
That's great.

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.940
That's right.

33
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.540
I'm with you.
