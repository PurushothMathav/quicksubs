00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.040
Stop!

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.540
Are you sitting here peeling apples?

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.240
Your wife is weak now.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.540
What's he going to do?

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.140
Let him get to the ground by himself.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.840
Zoe, sit down.

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.080
You have to rest.

8
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.040
Whatever you want to do, let this little guy help you do it.

9
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.060
Haha dad.

10
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.660
I want to go to the bathroom.

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.900
Dad, did you report it wrong?

12
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.740
What the hell are you talking about?

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.480
Emotions are an important time.

14
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.260
You have to take care of me.

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.020
Don't mistreat my turtle grandson, haha.

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.460
What the hell?

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.920
Love is not pregnant?

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.060
Haha.

19
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.420
It's got food poisoning.

20
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.580
Who said you were pregnant?

21
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.420
My good turtle grandson

22
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.660
Why not anymore?

23
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.580
Master was poisoned.

24
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.200
What's wrong?

25
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.440
I care about you.

26
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.660
He hopes you get well soon.

27
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.520
Yes.

28
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.660
You saved me on a plane four years ago.

29
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.180
Three years later, I have a happy family.

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.060
Don't rush to the end of life.

31
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.700
I'm depending on you.
