00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.440
I'm not. I'm Love Command.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.780
I'm afraid I won't show my face.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.020
Otherwise, how can you take this kind of photo?

4
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.240
That's what you told the judge.

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.420
I want to see if your mouth is hard or is the professional of our aviation lawyer team Qin Lam.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.840
No, I can't go to heaven.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.860
I can't leave the hospital.

8
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.880
Oh my gosh, we've been having sex for years.

9
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.380
You're not going to leave me, are you?

10
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.240
Everyone is responsible for what they have done.

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.560
What else did you do?

12
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.260
You can get the highest score in your major.

13
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.220
Obviously the interview is very touching, and there are people for you to listen to.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.640
Even someone I like has been chasing you for years.

15
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.500
Why is it that what I've worked so hard to get is within reach in front of you?

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.620
Your own efforts.

17
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.620
This is the result of your efforts.

18
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.580
Well, that's him. Turns out he set up Lam Cam.

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.540
I had heard before that he and Lin Cam were sisters living together day and night.

20
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.820
Again use this kind of inferior trick to count sisters.

21
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.780
Lin Xin is sorry.

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.600
We were wrong about you.

23
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.100
If an apology is helpful

24
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.640
What do you need order for?

25
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.100
Today all participants in bullying stop flying and hold back for half a year.

26
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.760
I know you're pretending to be Captain Ip to help me.

27
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.840
The snow is still here today.

28
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.900
He's Captain Ip's best friend.

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.900
What if you come to visit?

30
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.900
Don't worry.

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.380
Captain Ye.

32
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.840
You are a married man, what do you whisper to our piano?

33
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.220
Let me hear it too.

34
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.980
Yeah, what?
