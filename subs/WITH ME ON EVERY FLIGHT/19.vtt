00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.360
What are you standing there for?

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.900
Dad told us to go home for dinner.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.120
Wow, that's sweet.

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.180
Captain Ip called you home for lunch.

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.700
Hyun-yeon hasn't moved quickly yet.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360
Captain Ip called the lady.

7
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.440
What are you doing out there?

8
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.600
That's funny.

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.900
Don't think that Captain Ip protecting you before was meaningful to you.

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.340
It's just because the lady isn't here.

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.460
See your own identity.

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.000
I know who I am.

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240
Does Miss Bai know her identity?

14
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.940
Lin Qi, what do you mean?

15
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.740
Do you mean the fate of Lady Xinyang Shangli?

16
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.520
Ms. Lin, Vinh Thien and I were childhood friends.

17
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.240
Study abroad together again.

18
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.800
From school uniforms to wedding dresses

19
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.780
Not the kind of person you might suspect.

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.080
You said you were married to Captain Ip.

21
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.760
Where's the evidence, Lynch? What the hell are you?

22
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.260
Dare to question the lady.

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.720
Ma'am, don't worry.

24
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.180
We all believe you.

25
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.100
Why aren't you out yet?

26
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.780
Forget it, let's go ask him.

27
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.720
I just got back from the water.

28
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.080
I don't know what happened at the company.

29
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600
Can you tell me?

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.060
Of course, ma'am.

31
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.740
What is this?

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.580
You open it and you know.

33
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.700
The Heart of the Ocean
