00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.560
What's going on?

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.580
The wife's okay.

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.900
Dad, why are you here?

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.860
If I don't come, will you apologize to Love?

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.740
I don't.

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.500
I've seen it all.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.780
Did you get it wrong?

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560
Dinh, don't protect him.

9
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.420
If you don't remember long enough, teach him a lesson.

10
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.580
Hey, Dad, don't hit, don't move, don't move.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.580
Ha ha ha ha ha

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.780
Are you married or are you married to your ancestors?

13
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.480
Your future sister-in-law won't be a tiger, will she?

14
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.020
Ha ha ha

15
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.460
You know what?

16
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.820
Are you married?

17
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.140
It seems like it's time for him to introduce you to a blind date.

18
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.420
I can't say a word anymore.

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.100
Rongtian, I'm wrong.

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.540
I was wrong, okay?

21
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.900
"Don't tell my father about this, Jen.
