00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.420
Eat more.

2
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.360
My boyfriend is dead.

3
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.300
Really.

4
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.220
Ah, that's a shame.

5
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.160
The dead cannot rise again.

6
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.540
We have to look forward.

7
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.980
Find another one.

8
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.660
Uncle, I'm going to the airline for an interview.

9
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.260
It's okay not to date.

10
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.580
Which one do you like?

11
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.780
I'm not getting married anymore.

12
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.700
Why?

13
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.120
Fear of encountering unreliable players.

14
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.800
Then you marry my son.

15
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.120
My son is very special.

16
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.180
The surrounding female mosquitoes can't fly in.

17
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.460
Captain Ip is here.

18
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.680
The water record.

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.340
God, I've finally met my idol.

20
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.740
Four years ago, Captain Ye saved 125 lives.

21
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.940
Four years ago

22
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.000
Room 313 is calling Earth, requesting a malfunction.

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.860
313 took out his gun and asked to come back.

24
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.240
Please don't panic.

25
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.860
Just a little phone leak, don't panic.

26
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.840
The passengers.

27
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.120
I'm the captain of this flight, Ip Vinh Thien.

28
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.100
Please bend down and hug yourself and throw yourself between the two seats.

29
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.000
Please, the airline will take all passengers home safely.

30
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.380
Please believe us.

31
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.260
Captain Hero

32
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.440
I heard he's the biggest shareholder in Sunny Air.

33
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.560
I wish I could marry him.

34
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.380
You're not the only one who thinks so.

35
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.300
I want to get married too.

36
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.860
Lots of goddesses around.

37
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.780
Won't you let your daughter-in-law misunderstand him?
