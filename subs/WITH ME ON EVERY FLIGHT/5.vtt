00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.420
What's lying to me?

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.340
My whole life when it comes to good situations, I don't lie.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.700
Now give your pay card to your wife.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.260
Take it.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.920
The password is his birthday.

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.340
You are free to spend

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.040
Uncle, if you're not sick

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.600
So what I promised won't count.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.980
Your daughter-in-law can't say that.

10
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.600
Marriage is no joke.

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.520
That's it.

12
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.460
I'm going home to get married.

13
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.060
Mr. Ye, if not

14
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.580
Let's go.

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.580
hate me

16
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.200
How could I, I'm just a normal person.

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.220
If you don't hate it, don't leave.

18
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.860
So my father wouldn't get in trouble.

19
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.940
But those are two different things.

20
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.940
Xiaotian, how was your empty car interview?

21
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.820
The interview

22
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.460
It's my interview.

23
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.140
Add a microphone.

24
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.780
Lin Cam, I came to find A Phong.

25
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.600
Lam Cam

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.860
If you're really sorry

27
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.540
I can forgive you for breaking up last time.
