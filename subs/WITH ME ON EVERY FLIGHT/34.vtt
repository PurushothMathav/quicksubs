00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.680
Daughter-in-law, this is the juice I squeezed myself.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.780
Thank you, Dad.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720
Dad, you're sour.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.300
Why are you doing so much?

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.040
I think it fits.

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.500
Or you can drink my cup.

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.380
No need to eat first.

8
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.840
You're not eating?

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.700
He doesn't eat, ignore him.

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.960
Umm.

11
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.440
Umm.

12
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.700
Dad, what are you doing?

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.160
You hear that?

14
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.280
Your wife vomited.

15
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.200
I'll take her to the hospital.

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.660
Which hospital?

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.940
Here's my dad making some soup for Thanh Thanh.

18
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.940
Dad, what do you think?

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.500
Can't say a few words.

20
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.620
I'll take him to the hospital for a check-up in the afternoon.

21
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.500
I have such high emotional intelligence.

22
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.420
How can you give birth to an honest man like you?

23
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.900
Who is not a straight man?

24
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.200
Spicy girl, please use this that is both sour and spicy.

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.500
Is that right?

26
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.080
Twins, then this burden is big enough.

27
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.220
I had to quickly research food supplements.

28
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.860
What's going on?

29
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.760
Looks like I ate some unclean takeaway food.

30
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.760
You may have food poisoning.

31
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.900
Go, I'll take you to the hospital for a check-up.
