00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.960
Who opened the door?

2
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.800
Open the door. Come on. Open the door.

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.020
Who let me out?

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.220
Open the door.

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.460
Open the door for me

My friend's son has sent all his luggage back to the company.

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.840

Last night I saw the sun and rain sneak into the captain's office at night.

11
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.480
He had just arrived on the first day and dared to hook the pilot's head at night.

12
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.580
This type of person must be fired.

13
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.800
A Phong don't be impulsive

14
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.060
Maybe the sun just doesn't have to talk to him.
