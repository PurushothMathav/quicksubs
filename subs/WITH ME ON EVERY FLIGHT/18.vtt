00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.920
I also heard that the captain himself went to Paris the night before.

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.280
Bought a necklace of the ocean heart at auction

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.820
Two hundred million.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.780
Who did you say this was for?

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.840
It must be for Mrs. Ip.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.900
Who has the heart of the ocean?

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.640
Who's the real Ip?

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.940
Yeah, this is official.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.260
Some people who want to climb the phoenix dragon fear that it will be very sad.

10
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.220
I heard that the captain of the night plane's white moon has returned to the water.

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.980
What is a White Moon?

12
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.660
Hey, stop talking, stop talking, my colleague just arrived.

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.860
Hello, I'm the new flight attendant, Baek Shin Yeon.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.420
Hey, look, the necklace around his neck is the heart of the ocean.

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.860
Really, ma'am.

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.240
It's beautiful.

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.920
Moreover, he also brought the necklace Ye Xi School bought for his wife.

18
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.220
He must be Lady Ip.

19
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.000
I am the wife of Dung Thien.

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.820
You can call me Hyun-yeon.

21
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.280
What's going on?

22
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.900
I should remarry.

23
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.480
What are you standing there for?

24
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.020
Dad told us to go home for dinner.
