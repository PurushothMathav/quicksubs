00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.140
It's locked.

2
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.820
I feel like Lam Cam at the captain's office at night is more familiar than the lady.

3
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.480
Yeah, how did he know the password?

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.060
One is that you can find a place.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.480
It's just a coincidence.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.980
You forget the last time he was in the captain's office at night.

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.980
Maybe he turned it around then.

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.020
I don't know how to open this drawer.

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.800
I don't even know the password of the devil.

10
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.620
How did he know?

11
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.100
Looks like he really missed it.

12
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.300
What are you doing?

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.500
A captain on a flying mission can't bother me to call and ask the old man.

14
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.560
Lin Cam, you have to pretend to force to see if the object is good.

15
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.580
There's a lady here who uses you to call this number.

16
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.860
OK, so you call.

17
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.480
The old man blackened me a few years ago.

18
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.780
How can I call him?
