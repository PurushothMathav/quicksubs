00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.500
Captain Ip, what are you looking for?

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.040
There is no need for such hospitality between us.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.380
You can call my name.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.140
Dung Thien.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.200
Yes.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.080
By the way, tomorrow you will fly together for the first time.

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.940
I'm going to explain to you the considerations of flying for the first time.

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.700
Great, I was worried about completing the task by tomorrow.

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.700
If you have trouble with passengers on the plane

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.300
That's the solution.

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.620
Take a look.

12
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.960
It's too hot.

13
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.700
God, it's hot.

14
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.080
Do you have a fever?

15
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.020
If not, come here today first.

16
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.820
Strong

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.780
I'll find you a fever reducer.

18
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.220
Okay.

19
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440
If you won't help me.

20
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.700
Can you help me keep the forest?

21
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.100
Brother Ye, you are mine.
