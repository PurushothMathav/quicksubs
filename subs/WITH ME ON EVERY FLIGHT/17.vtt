00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.180
What, you're the legendary electronics captain.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.620
Wait a minute.

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.060
Solve my problem first.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.820
You told me this was a man.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.220
My father a while ago.

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.500
I love the p-chart.

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.460
So...

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.300
He's a sister-in-law.

9
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.540
Yes, it's real.

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.620
Sister-in-law.

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.980
Hey.

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.080
Ye Yongtian, you bastard.

13
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.620
No, tell me earlier.

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.260
Excuse me.

15
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.540
I shouldn't have hidden you from my father.

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600
I know you prefer a normal life.

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.500
Don't worry, the company doesn't know about our relationship.

18
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.540
My identity will not affect your life.

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.580
Give me some time to digest.

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.020
Yes.

21
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.920
I thought it was just a coincidence.

22
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.800
I can't believe he's the famous Captain Ip.

23
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.280
I married my savior four years ago.

24
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.320
Did you hear that?

25
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.600
Our crew has a new colleague.

26
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.780
I heard that Captain Ip's white moon has returned to the country.
