1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.700
Last time we broke up.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.220
I can meet you.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.660
The wrong person is you.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.500
The one who should ask for forgiveness is also a friend.

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.380
The next interviewer, Lam Cam, please prepare.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.620
Who is the bedroom?

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.280
Oh, Lin Cam.

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.740
Why are your clothes so dirty?

9
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.500
Strict dust requirements

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.620
Dressing properly doesn't work.

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.260
The dream is about to apologize.

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.520
I despise the first.

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.480
See if you can give me a chance?

14
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.980
I can definitely do well.

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.160
Yes, my friend Yang Ming Yan wears long clothes, and I also broke up with my boyfriend.

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.580
Can you give him one more chance?

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.960
He was a man who wanted to climb the dragon.

18
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.500
Don't mess with me.

19
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.200
Go back to your hometown.

20
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.420
Your only chance to stay in the big city is over.

21
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.220
Now you're begging me not to come.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.020
Maybe I can help you.

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.540
Go back to your hometown.

24
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.180
Go home.

25
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.760
Hey.

26
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.820
Who announced it in your friends circle?

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.700
Which family do you promise?
