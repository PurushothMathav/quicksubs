00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.920
What do you mean?

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.200
Ask questions about my identity.

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.820
I didn't say that. You said that yourself.

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.740
Of course I have a marriage certificate.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.640
It's just that I didn't bring it here at home.

6
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.140
Who goes to work every day with a marriage certificate?

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.360
Yes, Linchen.

8
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.000
I see you can't ask for high performance.

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.380
Jealous of us, ma'am.

10
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.500
I heard you're still a girl.

11
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.880
A person without a biological father without a foster mother has no education.

12
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.040
Interfering with the emotions of others.

13
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.220
I don't want to recruit people.

14
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.840
It was you who wanted to give the marriage certificate, you didn't bring it.

15
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.660
But the performance has matured.

16
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.620
Last time I saw him in his office.

17
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.100
If you are the real lady, show us.

18
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.120
How do I get into the Lord s Office?

19
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.580
Besides, I didn't have a marriage certificate to show them.

20
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.100
I don t like people coming to my office.

21
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.420
Forget it.

22
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.220
I'll bring it to you next time.

23
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.100
The night captain doesn't like people coming into his office.

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.120
Can't even his wife?

25
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.000
Lin Cáº§n, you are less bizarre.

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.780
Isn't it just an office?

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.160
The night captain loved the lady so much, he bought all the hundreds of millions of necklaces.

28
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.580
What's wrong with the office?

29
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.500
Hyun-yeon, let's go.
