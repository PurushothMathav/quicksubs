00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.640
This is Captain Ip.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.140
From Captain Ip's office, of course, it was himself.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.440
Didn't I tell you not to?

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.020
How dare you put on a first-class little cotton suit, pretend to be him, quickly take it off.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.240
You're my wife.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.500
How can I let you face this on your own?

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.580
I'll handle it here.

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.240
You take me home first.

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.060
Important moments with your husband are very responsible.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.260
Dad, let's go.

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.720
Huh?

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.580
She really needs to be a long-time wife.

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.260
It's impossible.

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.960
Leaders are misunderstood.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.460
I am the good sister of my relatives.

16
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm also for his sake.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.980
I've called the office supervisor.

18
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.100
What the truth is, I'll see for myself.

19
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.880
How is that possible?

20
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.500
Isn't the supervisor broken?

21
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.260
Looks like Blue Airlines should innovate.

22
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.540
Sister

23
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.160
I was fired and cordoned off by Captain Ip.

24
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.860
You're happy now.

25
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.200
Pretend to be a captain and fire the crew.

26
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.500
When it was finished, he could not open it, and Liu Ye was alone at the other end of his head.

27
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.760
I guess I misread you.

28
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.260
Have you slept with him for a long time?

29
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.500
It was an excuse for me and my dream to break up.

30
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.400
And...

31
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.300
Hello friend.

32
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.840
You've known him for a few days.

33
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.700
Did you know you're thinking of four people who have had a favorite for a long time?
