00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.733
When do you have an order?

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:04.866
I picked him up

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.500
Oh yes yes yes our family got rich overnight

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.666
I'm here to solve Brother Lu's problems

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.100
Marry such a man who wants to save face

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.866
You are so unlucky

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.966
I get robbed every time

8
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.666
I'm not done with you

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.366
Sister, get a divorce

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.966
He is not worth your life

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.700
And he's still in a lot of debt

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.966
10 years, 30 years, 50 years, I am willing to pay it back with him

13
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.800
Sister, why are you so stubborn?

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.666
Why can't you see mine?

15
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.666
Xiao Rui, I know you are good for my sister.

16
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.100
That's what I believe in my vision

17
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.300
You don't have to save money for this

18
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.933
When are you going to hurt my sister?

19
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.366
I advise you to speak well

20
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.366
Don't blame me for turning my face and not recognizing people

21
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.400
Let you climb from here, right?

22
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.966
You thought you were shrinking behind my sister

23
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.166
I dare not touch you?

24
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.466
Don't make trouble, I'll go home, sister.

25
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.200
I've never seen you as my sister

26
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.466
Today I invite you to buffet

27
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.200
Although you are an amazing cloud master

28
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.966
But I have to handle the dinner party

29
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.700
Don't worry about land warfare

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.200
You owe your brother money

31
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.666
I'll pay it back with you.

32
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.666
I'm not worried.

33
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.566
Can you change your name?

34
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.800
Calling land warfare is too alienating

35
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.000
What shall I call you?

36
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.300
Dear baby, you can choose one yourself.

37
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.666
hate
