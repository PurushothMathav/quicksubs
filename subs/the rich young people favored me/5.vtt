00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.700
Your kid uh

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I missed a little bit.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.766
But the good thing is that it is fully stocked every day.

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.766
Are you done cleaning?

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.733
Who let you lose

6
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.733
Not such a big house

7
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.266
Ouch, we can't do without civil protection of identity

8
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.566
This is what you want the most.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.100
It's cleaned up, Brother Lu

10
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.266
Sister-in-law is so slow

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.000
Don't pick it up and use it as money.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.766
Then I'll go wash up first

13
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.633
What about my sister? What did you do to my sister?

14
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.200
But I'm curious what you say

15
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:01.966
Mobile phone location

16
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.633
I won't let any man get close to my sister

17
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.966
Does your sister know that she is so infatuated?

18
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.500
It's for his own good.

19
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.800
No one likes the feeling of being watched

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.366
I'm just worried about his safety. What's wrong?

21
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.166
And when will I recognize

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.200
The only one worthy of my sister throughout the process was when she joined the party

23
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.366
Master Du

24
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.433
Is it amazing?

25
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:23.700
Of course, yeah.

26
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.400
At a young age, he reached the top of the global rich list

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.200
Ten

28
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.566
Brother-in-law is flattering

29
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.666
What are you doing?

30
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.100
What does Young Master Lu have to do with you?

31
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.866
Poor like you

32
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.266
Looking like this

33
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.700
God, he can't even compare to a finger

34
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.000
It's true that I really can't go on a blind date with him

35
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What do you do?

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.300
And stay away from my sister

37
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.100
Otherwise I won't let it go
