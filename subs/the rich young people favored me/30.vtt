00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Is he crazy?

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.100
This is Master Yun's famous work

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.033
Stop

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.200
I'll take this one.

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.566
It's him 10 million is not a decimal

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.900
Even if he loses this life, he can't take it out

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.000
Zi Rui, don't fool around

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.366
He is vain

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.833
Not worth your trust

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.033
I didn't expect him to be Gu Qianyi's younger brother

11
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.966
How do you know I didn't bring any money?

12
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.200
Could it be that you are clinging to some high branch?

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.166
I'm actually willing to lend you 10 million

14
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.933
I don't need to climb anyone at all

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.366
You didn't embezzle public funds on your back, did you?

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.233
You shut up

17
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.866
Land warfare is not this position

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.266
Sir, you have insufficient balance on this card

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.300
Damn, got the wrong card

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.466
Excessive little white face

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.200
Whether it's this painting or my sister

22
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.000
Neither deserves

23
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.366
No money in the card doesn't mean no cash

24
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.200
You can really pretend

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.500
I know what's in your heart

26
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.900
They need to force this kind of thing

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.266
I will do what I promise you

28
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.200
One thousand get ten million free and come to the scene of the Han Conference

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.733
Have you been staying with Mr. Lu for a long time now?

30
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.700
How can you imagine that you are the boss?

31
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.900
You have no idea how many people dream of success

32
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.033
Humph to be you

33
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.433
Forget it, I advise you not to be too presumptuous

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.466
Otherwise, I'll make you unable to even sit on the side pillars

35
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.400
It's not up to you.

36
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.933
Don't delay.

37
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.966
Admit that you have no money and will not drop the price.

38
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.900
My money has arrived.
