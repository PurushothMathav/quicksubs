1
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.266
What other work arrangements do you have?

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.900
Understand the company's business

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.866
What about today?

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.333
How can I carry it for hundreds of thousands of years a day?

5
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.200
You can't even do it well.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.400
Then go

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400
Our company is not owned by your family.

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.866
Do what you want

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:20.666
What should I do?

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.800
The company is at home

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.166
If you are not convinced, you can go to Mr. 6

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.600
Never mind.

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.700
If things get too big, it will still make land wars difficult

14
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.066
Yan Ziyun is looking for you

15
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.100
You find me

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.100
You dare to hit me on the road?

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.466
You need to find a place to pick up the trash.

18
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.900
You are the wild man found in the street

19
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:53.800
It's a pity that he's not broken and thin. He's already married.

20
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.800
You, this is the shady little three

21
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.166
Let's go

22
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.600
neuropathy

23
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.300
If you dare to bully you again, you will have no chance to speak

24
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.300
Who are you?

25
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.466
It doesn't matter who I am

26
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.000
You just need to know

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.833
I would give up my life for him

28
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.800
It is estimated that I will definitely calculate this account for you.
