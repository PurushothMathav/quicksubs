00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.566
Stop fighting.

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.166
As long as you sign this obediently today

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.566
I can still save him one

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.066
If you put your name on it, you can't escape

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.366
You don't care about his death at all

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.300
Wait, if something happens to him

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.000
This agreement will not take effect

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.166
I promise you.

9
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.566
As long as you sign it obediently

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.600
For the rest of their lives, I

11
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.633
What can you guarantee?

12
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.700
Make him the manager

13
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.066
zhangguan branch

14
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.766
And Zhu Shengli

15
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.200
I can't get rid of this doll dear

16
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.800
Why drag down the land war?

17
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.066
This land war is against me again and again for you

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.800
If I hadn't tolerated him

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.066
He's already unemployed

20
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:38.866
OK

21
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:40.900
promise you

22
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.900
Mr. Zhu

23
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.966
It's too early to talk about things

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.233
I don't want to be beaten by irrelevant people

25
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.200
What did he say to you?

26
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.700
OK

27
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.500
You want to divorce me?

28
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.466
Our marriage was an accident

29
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.666
There is no need to survive now

30
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.233
He lied to you.

31
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.300
By the way, Mr. Lu doesn't matter

32
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.533
You work hard in the future

33
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.466
Don't be here.

34
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.666
Which job is more important than you?

35
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.900
If you lose your job, you can find it again.

36
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.466
But I lost you

37
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.433
Where can I find one?
