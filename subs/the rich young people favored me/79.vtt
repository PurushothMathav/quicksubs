00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.000
What did you guess?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Guess the story of drunkenness and the new president is Li Qi?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.466
i

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.966
Sister-in-law, your best friend looks up to me too much

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.333
You lent us 10 million so readily before

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.000
Exactly.

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.966
He is the external partner and president of Lu Enterprises

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:17.600
Thanks.

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.233
Li Qi took bodyguards to rescue us last time

10
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.200
Don't do this, I can't afford it

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.633
And thank you for going out to help the dog show

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.133
The eldest young master really can't hide it, tell the truth

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.133
He has already said it, what else can I say?

14
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.100
I have one last favor to ask of you

15
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.366
Please approve ASAP.

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.066
Sister-in-law, I don't have this right.

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.400
You are leaving the job

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.333
Yes!

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.100
Was it an accident to join you before?

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.733
I've always wanted to start a painting studio

21
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.700
It means I don't have that future

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.200
Young woman, I don't know anything these days

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.933
Ask Mr. Lu

24
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.000
I'll go first

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.300
Mr. Pan, come back to me

26
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.633
Mr. Lu, please explain it to me.
