00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.466
Whoever runs away won't get a penny

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.633
The other side is crowded

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.833
Is there anything

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.500
What's up?

5
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.366
You pay attention

6
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.566
I've got what I want.

7
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.500
Now I'm helping you.

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.166
It all hurts me

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.900
Don't worry about me when the land war is over, go away

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.866
Don't you worry.

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.300
I'll take you away right now

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.300
Let him go break up

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.166
You can only live if you die

14
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.366
Lu Shan is not joking with his life

15
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.366
Want my life

16
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.666
If I don't look for you, come with me immediately

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.433
Only I die

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.466
Dead why

19
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.200
You go away
