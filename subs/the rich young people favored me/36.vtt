00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
Xiaoyun

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.833
You convinced Mr. Lu

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.133
How did you convince him to leave it alone?

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.000
You must have begged him for a long time

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.866
Aggrieved husband

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.233
Pardon me?

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.500
Husband husband

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.366
I'll buy you a drink.

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Aren't you afraid of getting drunk?

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.200
I misunderstood you so much

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.400
Don't scare me.

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.400
What if I'm the kind of person who curls up to please you first?

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.866
The person who attacks you again

14
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.200
Nini, what I want to tell you is

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.600
Be careful with men

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
You're my wife

17
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.900
You must take care of yourself outside

18
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.500
Ok husband

19
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.500
Good night

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:52.933
Good night

21
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.166
Ouch.

22
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.900
Great, you finally said that Wuhan University is missing, hahaha.

23
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.666
We successfully signed this agreement

24
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.900
Land warfare also contributed a lot

25
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.133
Don't put light on that gun boy's face

26
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.066
What does Mr. Lu's contract have to do with him?

27
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.933
Assistant Lu usually talks like this

28
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.633
Take credit to make you happy

29
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.200
Why did you come to my house?

30
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.300
I'm not good

31
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.366
I'm here today.

32
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.466
It is the courage to discuss marriage with the country V

33
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.066
What did you say? I didn't promise.

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.800
I will decide your marriage

35
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.500
You see, Mr. Song even brought the bride price

36
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.100
Why do you make a decision for me?

37
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.066
I told you long ago that the doll kiss you is the court

38
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.200
Miss Fu, what about this agreement?

39
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.000
I can sign it, or I can do it in front of you two.

40
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.866
Monkey Sage, don't get excited

41
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.533
You can marry without marrying

42
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.300
You also want us to complete the marriage as soon as possible

43
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.000
A little self-awareness, okay?

44
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.833
You can get intoxicated once, and I can also tune in.

45
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:50.700
Gu Qianying, what do you mean?

46
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700
The Gu family wants to marry Gu Shiqianjin

47
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.900
Then I don't want this identity

48
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.533
Gu Qianying, what do you mean?

49
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:59.000
I mean I want to cut ties with the Gu family

50
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.800
You can't imagine the soldier is dead
