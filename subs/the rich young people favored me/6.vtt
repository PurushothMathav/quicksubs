Xiao Rui

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.700
Do you want your sister to be a widow?

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.133
No, sister.

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.466
I'm here to take you home. I'm married

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.866
Marrying more is my home

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.333
he

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.333
sister

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.533
He can't give you a good material life at all

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.966
You can only suffer if you follow him

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.033
I don't care.

11
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.766
Although he is just a doorman

12
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.933
But he is better.

13
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.066
door head

14
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.300
No, absolutely not.

15
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.966
Sister, I won't agree.

16
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.333
If you have the same attitude as mom

17
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.466
I don't have to call me sister anymore

18
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.966
I'm just worried about you.

19
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.066
Go back and cooperate with the project to help me prepare for the art exhibition

20
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.200
I won't do it

21
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.566
Land War Actually I have a fiancÃ©

22
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.500
I didn't want to marry him before I agreed to get the certificate from you.

23
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200
If you go back, I won't go back

24
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.200
Because I also have a problem I've never met

25
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.700
Then we are a bit alike.

26
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.466
So are we lying to each other?

27
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.266
Will not

28
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.233
Don't worry, I will be beautiful as soon as possible.

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.900
Borrow the streamer hospital. Hmm.

30
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.800
Oh, one more question.

31
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.400
There's only one bedroom in this house.

32
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.833
How are you going to sleep tonight?

33
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.866
The strength is really not that brittle

34
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.433
You sleep on the bed, I sleep on the sofa

35
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.466
Then I sleep in bed alone

36
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.900
Good night good night

37
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.666
Why is his back?

38
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.166
It gives me a very familiar feeling.
