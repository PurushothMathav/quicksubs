00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.800
Leave quickly after delivering something

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.200
sister

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.600
I would like to take care of you and the baby.

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.533
Gu Ren, do you think I'm dead?

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.900
I can ask for 24 hours of recovery

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.333
Give you the best nutritional protection

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.566
Enough is enough, sister.

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.166
You misunderstood me.

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.966
I just want to be a good uncle

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:19.866
uncle

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.266
You have lost this qualification

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.800
I really know I was wrong.

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.200
Don't you want

14
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.533
Do children give their loved ones more protection?

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.100
No need sister

16
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.800
Please forgive me.

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.100
I apologize for everything I've done before

18
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.466
I said we don't have any relationship anymore

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.666
Brother-in-law, brother-in-law, I beg you, please persuade my sister

20
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.433
You really regret it

21
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.966
I already called you brother-in-law

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.966
Am I not sincere enough?

23
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.300
Say it

24
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.666
Who knows what's going on in your heart?

25
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.466
Angel

26
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.933
I'm just thinking about my brother-in-law's education

27
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.966
Men should have jobs

28
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.500
Have your own business

29
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.766
Xiao Rui, if you really think so

30
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.566
We can still do housework.

31
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.666
Really? Hello?

32
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.833
Then I'm going to buy baby products for the baby now.

33
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.300
He's more anxious than me.

34
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.466
I'm still a little worried

35
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.266
I just think he will lie to you again.

36
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.833
I'll send someone to keep an eye on him

37
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.300
Make sure he can't do anything to hurt you
