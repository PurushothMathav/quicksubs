00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.800
What's the trouble with you poor assistant?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.333
This Mr. Lu bid 10 million

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.666
Are you kidding?

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.366
Open the topic

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.866
The adverb is the director of the board

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.300
This painting means a lot to me

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.466
I must have him

8
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.633
Why the Warriors?

9
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.366
I know I shouldn't mean to take your life

10
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.200
My Identity

11
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.500
I'm mad I didn't recognize it so early

12
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.500
If Master Lin were someone else

13
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.066
Would you like him?

14
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.666
Whoever Master Lin is

15
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.466
I only like his words

16
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.066
So?

17
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.600
You just like my words

18
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.366
cranky

19
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.333
I only like one person for you

20
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.266
Assistant Lu

21
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.700
This is not your little couple's love and scolding

22
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.600
Pretty place

23
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.933
Inside the exhibition

24
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:44.300
I'm afraid no one can control what I want to do

25
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.066
Arrogant and shameless

26
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.766
Don't buy it, go home and ask questions

27
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.300
This painting means something different.

28
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.466
I'll take it.

29
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.066
Beat the swollen face and make the fat man

30
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.133
I'd like to see if you two can't come up with the money later

31
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.900
What's the shame?

32
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.800
10 million for the last time

33
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:01.600
It's a deal!

34
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.733
Why give it to him?

35
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.600
This painting is my Miss Lin

36
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.566
Where did you get the confidence to be so arrogant?

37
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.233
Can you swipe your card and take a picture of something for me?

38
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.266
We give it to you

39
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.333
Hey, don't go

40
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.766
I'll return this painting to you when I cut it into waste paper
