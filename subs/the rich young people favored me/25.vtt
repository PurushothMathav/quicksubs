1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:00.966
How is that possible?

2
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.500
Doesn't he never meet anyone?

3
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.266
How Cloud Master behaves

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.200
According to what Miss Lin meant

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.900
No need, Miss Xiao

6
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.066
My wife has a bet with Lin Ziyun

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.766
So ask Master Yun to appear

8
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.066
Master Yun explained that the signature will be verified by me

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.800
You gave me this signature

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.000
No need to test

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.866
It was given by the inspector.

12
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:22.966
What if it's fake?

13
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.366
You have guts!

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.966
Dare to question Miss Xiao

15
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.533
It's Miss Xiao

16
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.500
But the loudest trump card in the art world

17
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.100
Brokers who dare to risk anti-cloud ambassadors

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.633
You really don't know what to do

19
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.766
This signature card

20
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.666
It's fake, don't you believe it?

21
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.766
I'll give you another one, Miss Xiao.

22
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.800
How dare you play with me?

23
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.766
Just kidding

24
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.900
Who knew you were so stupid

25
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.800
It's true

26
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
Why did you deliberately set me up?

27
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.433
Because I hate you the most

28
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.966
A person with bad water

29
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.300
Now people say

30
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.666
Not humiliating

31
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.666
Even if my signature is fake

32
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.100
You can't have Master Yun's signature either

33
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.600
How did you know I didn't?
