00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
elder sister

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.300
He's your grandfather.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.000
He is Mr. Lu

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.666
He is Mr. Lu's grandfather

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.500
Grandpa deer has a good meal

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.233
Throat pain after taking medicine

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.500
Bastard, you grandpa deer

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.800
The deer always asked

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.566
You must rest ASAP.

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.133
I'll go up first

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.600
I sent Grandpa Deer home

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.266
Hey wait

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.700
This little girl is my savior

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.866
You want to give him a promotion and a raise

15
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.100
You are the girl who took Grandpa Lu to the hospital last time.

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.366
Grandpa Lu also gave me Mr. Lu's personal mobile phone number

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.500
What can't be added?

18
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.133
Then I get in the car

19
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:44.866
Goodbye grandpa

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.000
You must bring that girl today

21
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.633
Otherwise, I will go to the company to make trouble

22
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.000
Please cancel my doll kiss with Gu's relatives first.

23
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.766
You unfilial grandson

24
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.333
How do you know it's not suitable if you haven't seen it?

25
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.200
No one is suitable except Gu Yun

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.833
Your dad is in a hurry

27
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.300
Lin Zheng, you came at the right time.

28
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.966
You bring your niece-in-law to meet my dad

29
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.133
He is on a business trip

30
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.033
I'll let you out two

31
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.866
It pisses me off.

32
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.600
Why did you let me owe you a favor?

33
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.000
Remember that.

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.266
I have the phone.

35
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.666
Grandpa won't force you to leave me your phone number

36
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.533
You have no intention of divorcing the land war at all

37
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.166
I haven't figured out how to tell him yet

38
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:46.366
Stop talking nonsense and sign this agreement as much as possible

39
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.533
I can still keep a land war alive

40
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:49.400
So what happened?

41
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.400
Of course, he paid for his life

42
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:57.333
You must not have an accident when answering the phone website.

43
00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.966
Hello, the user you dialed is temporarily unavailable.
