1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
sister-in-law

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.100
Are these all gifts for my niece-in-law?

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.966
Yeah.

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.400
He should compensate him more for making things difficult before

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.733
But he was adopted by the Gu family after all

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.900
Fake adultery really wants to let him into the antlers

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Not biological

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.033
How could this happen?

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.266
Yes, Auntie.

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.466
Chiwa and I used to be classmates

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.100
He told me since he was a child

12
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.800
When he grows up, he wants to marry into a wealthy family

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.666
Does he know who my son is?

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.766
Of course I do.

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.066
He pretends not to know.

16
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.866
I'm just afraid that you will know his true face

17
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.266
1,000 people were raised in wealthy families

18
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.333
Unlike the vain girls

19
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:40.566
So he left the country to let your son go

20
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.366
Here it is.

21
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.066
The painting level of the Gu family is extremely low

22
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.900
The title of Master Yuan was bought by him with money

23
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.433
Does Celia know about this?

24
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.666
no.

25
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.800
He has long been fascinated by that woman

26
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.666
OK.

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.166
Let me be the villain who beats mandarin ducks

28
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.966
Leave my son as soon as possible

29
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.400
Gu Qianyu, you hid deep enough

30
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.633
No no no what do you mean

31
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.566
How dare you trick my son into getting married?

32
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.733
I really didn't want to marry Lu Dachao at first

33
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.300
I chose to flash marriage with your son

34
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.333
But our relationship is real now

35
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.766
Well said

36
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.666
Do you really know my son?

37
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.466
Do you know who he is?
