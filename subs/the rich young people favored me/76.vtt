00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.766
Doctor, how is my wife?

2
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.600
You talk to the child as packaging.

3
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.233
Your wife is overly frightened

4
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.966
I don't know when I'll wake up

5
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.400
Official payment

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.633
Damn excellent

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.166
Whoever you lose is a good person

8
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:25.700
It's all your fault, you're not qualified to stand here

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.766
You don't count on your feet.

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.000
What does it have to do with me?

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.366
You are complicit

12
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.033
Have to bear the consequences

13
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.300
You want to disengage Lu's cooperation with the story

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.600
You Lu's don't deserve it

15
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.400
No burglary

16
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.166
My group can only be better

17
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.800
Did you not think clearly?

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.033
Entering the house and sealing it is the number one enterprise in the business world

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.166
How much is that?

20
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.900
And I've worked on billions of projects.

21
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.200
It will soon leave you behind

22
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.700
You are so confident that you can win this project

23
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.466
Of course, the overall business of the bedroom

24
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.466
An average of tens of millions of orders cannot be processed

25
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.866
Let alone come up

26
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.633
Go down, then we'll see

27
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.066
When my sister wakes up

28
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:18.466
Let's see how you kneel and beg for mercy

29
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.900
Then you will have nothing

30
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.700
Hello, I lost the cooperative market.

31
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.000
Can't last 100 million

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.466
What the hell did you do?
