00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.833
Why are you suing me?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.866
Just because you hurt my wife

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.900
Just using power for personal gain

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.333
I am now the head of Lu Enterprises

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.166
What's wrong with publicly protecting you?

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.200
I'll let you do that. I'll wait.

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.800
This is grandpa's Anji

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.566
Your stay is up to me

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.066
Absolutely impossible

10
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.833
I have already told your grandfather about you.

11
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.233
After many years

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.066
The road is endless

13
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.300
Where am I worse than you?

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.500
All you think about is yourself

15
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.033
I miss you or I comb your mind

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.766
You hurry up

17
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:46.400
Even Lao Tzu will not be the chairperson of a rich nation

18
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.700
Why didn't you wait for me to come and pick you up?

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.000
Yes!

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.366
I'm in a hurry to send the publication's separate drawings to Mr. Lu

21
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.633
Oh, Mr. Lu just wrote about people

22
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.966
Seriously, is the current president?

23
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.933
Could it be Grandpa Lu?

24
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.033
Don't you like his usual criminal work?

25
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.333
Yes, Grandpa Lu, how did the road move away?

26
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.300
I don't know who the new president will be

27
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.466
When do you take office?

28
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.166
The new president of the rebellion will take your money

29
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.133
What do you know about the new president?

30
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.966
Ah, then I have something to do, I'll go first

31
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.066
Don't worry

32
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.800
Anyone who recognizes the company will definitely leave

33
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.900
I'm so curious what kind of person he is

34
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.100
Can take back all the positions the size of the road
