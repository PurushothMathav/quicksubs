00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.333
Impossible. He has only been in the company for a few days.

5
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.066
I'm not qualified to be a director at all

6
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.233
You didn't make trouble at the meeting

7
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.233
Lu is always unfair

8
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.500

Do you want to open a fish farm for the company?

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.200
Mr. Lu is not here for you to speak

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.533
Jiang Ziyu demoted to planner

14

Mr. Lu adjourned

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.666
I don't agree with us to have another fight

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.233
Like what?

17
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.100
It's about to be an exhibition auction with the master

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.500
Let's see who gets his favor first

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.366
Get the signature

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.166
I write my own meaning just by moving my hands

21
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.366
If I win

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.800

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.633
You will lose

26
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.900
I heard that the factory where you broke up at that time was not strict enough

27
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.266
Why did you promise him? It doesn't matter.

28
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.266
You are free!

29
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.666
Everything

30
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.900
Hurry up and help me contact the painting and calligraphy agent, boy.

If you chase stars like this, you will not be afraid of the wind.

33
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.566
Make it, don't talk nonsense

34
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.300
I have to make it clear to everyone. Go

35
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.200
I have to lower the ground.
