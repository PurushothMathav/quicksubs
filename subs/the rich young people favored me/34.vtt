1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.633
As long as we get married

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.466
I can sign this contract immediately

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.400
Thank you Mr. Lu for being cute

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.900
But you know I'm married.

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.966
I don't mind.

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.266
You can get a divorce.

7
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.533
Mr. Lu's strong twist is not sweet

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.000
I don't want to threaten you anymore.

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.500
It's just that I want to reassure my grandpa

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.833
So I had to do this.

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.100
Your grandfather

12
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.900
Grandpa's only wish is to see us get married

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.966
Can I see grandpa?

14
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.300
Maybe I can ask the old man to break the engagement

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.033
We see

16
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.166
You still won't give up on you

17
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.400
Aren't you afraid I'll do something to him?

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.300
The entanglement between us has nothing to do with Ah Zhan

19
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.733
Marrying my fiancee is a capital offense

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.766
You calm down

21
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.566
If you don't marry me

22
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.066
There is no way out of land warfare

23
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.966
You are married Gu Qianyu

24
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.266
sick

25
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.800
Let go stop
