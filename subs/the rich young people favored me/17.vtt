1
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.700
I don't want to be with you now.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.733
I have no grudge against you

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.966
Why do you keep picking things up?

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.466
Don't think that someone who always knows how to help him can grab it

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.433
I always have to

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.000
Keep your mouth clean

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.666
I don't care about the position of director

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.066
Since you don't plan anything

9
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.500
You shouldn't be your man

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.366
Lin Ziming

11
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.666
When will Mr. Lu hand over the financial resources and level to you?

12
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.100
When do you mind

13
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.733
I advise you not to do it for irrelevant people

14
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.200
Lost his job

15
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.700
Do I want to watch you bully my people?

16
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.366
Your people hum

17
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.933
Your child can't go anywhere without a man

18
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.633
I married your poor husband for you

19
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.066
Why do I think I don't need you?

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.300
Your husband doesn't

21
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.766
I'm still him.

22
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.433
The biggest backer

23
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.300
I also deserve to wait for your hands to be useless

24
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.500
I see what else you do

25
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.600
Collect some for me.

26
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.100
It's just a mess

27
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.466
Then hum

28
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.500
Annoying me is self-taught grave

29
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.700
I have to teach you a lesson to shut up

30
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.200
If Mr. Lu knew you were bullying me

31
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.400
So what if you know?
