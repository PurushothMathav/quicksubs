00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.200
You are the ocean

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.533
If this yard

3
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.300
There is no one else named the ocean

4
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.000
That was me!

5
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Ocean, you finally figured it out

6
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.700
Look at these trash bullying me

7
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.166
You teach me a lesson

8
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.766
Teach me a lesson

9
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.566
But you came out just in time

10
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.300
As long as you kneel down and kowtow to me now

11
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.666
Get out of this yard

12
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.900
Then I can spare him.

13
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.400
Kneel down for you

14
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.233
You want to die for free?

15
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.300
Ocean, how dare you

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.933
Ruthlessness should have been committed as follows

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.133
Say something useful

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.466
Point out the behind-the-scenes

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.100
Then get out of this yard

20
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.600
I can spare you.

21
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.066
Spare my life.

22
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.766
Something to talk about

23
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.133
I won't teach you a lesson today

24
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.866
You don't know what rules are

25
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:46.733
You rubbish

26
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.066
I'll give you three moves first

27
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.366
Lest you be told by your fellow disciples that I bully you

28
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.500
Why do people who are courting death in this world prove

29
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.266
Courting death is my right to life

30
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.600
The boss was shot away

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.066
What kind of monster is he?

32
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.500
This is not a broken bone essence

33
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.200
I don't even know what realm I am

34
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.500
Just be a gunman

35
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.966
You are so stupid

36
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.800
Han Yang, you have broken through the bone strength

37
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.166
To the Royal Mother Sword who was just 18 years old

38
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
Tell me who sent you

39
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.800
You are the destruction

40
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:31.666
i

41
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.833
It's just because you take up a lot of money

42
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.633
What a stupid and loyal dog

43
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.566
I hope your bones are as hard as your mouth

44
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.566
Ah you

45
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:42.966
You are from the same sea

46
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.100
Longmen won't let you go

47
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.166
Give you a chance you are useless

48
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.300
Then die.

49
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.366
What do you want?

50
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.700
Stop him now

51
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.366
Ahhh

52
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.566
Lying and lying

53
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.666
But I don't want to hear it anymore

54
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.200
Yeah, OK.
