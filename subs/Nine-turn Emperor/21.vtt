00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.433
Sing worry-free, what do you want to intervene in?

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.866
Young Master Li is trying to kill me too

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.366
There will be a chance.

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.100
Then you have to work hard

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.200
Your only chance to kill me is inside the monster

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.833
Then our Demon Wake Sword

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.266
Ghost

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.666
This Mr. Li is better said to be good at forbearance

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.466
To put it bluntly, it is both delicious and vulgar

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.900
No courage

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.400
You have a grudge against him

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.700
Then why do you like to watch idiots show off their power?

13
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.600
Such a fool can only wake up when he dies

14
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.466
So you want me to kill him?

15
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.766
You killed his brother

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.033
You don't kill him

17
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.366
He will kill you

18
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.700
I like you very much.

19
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.966
Miss Lan, why are you here?

20
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:54.933
how

21
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.800
If you are allowed to participate in Yuan Men's no choice, will you not allow me to come?

22
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.566
Ah no no

23
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.266
Is it just that the South City Lord knows about this?

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300
Of course I do.

25
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.966
Otherwise, how did I get here?

26
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.266
It seems that City Lord Nan does not approve of Miss Nan coming to the city

27
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.133
Miss Nan should go back first

28
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.066
This city is by no means a good enemy

29
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.600
You think I'm a burden to you

30
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.700
Oh no no

31
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.666
And if I ever get in danger

32
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.233
Will you protect me?

33
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.600
At first

34
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.300
If it weren't for Miss Nan and City Lord Nan sacrificing their lives to get along

35
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.000
My husband and wife are long dead

36
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.100
So even if I, Han Yang, risk my life

37
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.800
I will also protect Miss Nan

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.433
That's good

39
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.500
Then let me, Han Yang, do my best

40
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.100
Let Miss Nan become Yuan Men Qin's disciple

41
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.666
That's a joke. Go
