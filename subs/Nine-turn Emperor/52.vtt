1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.500
You learn from each other

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.866
It's just that this door mainly made it clear in advance

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.300
click until

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.666
Who dares to violate the rules?

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.433
The door owner is gone

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.066
Just sparring

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.033
Less lottery

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.166
What do you think?

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.166
The once-in-a-decade Hundred Doors Dance is about to begin

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.100
My original door

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.233
So far, there is still a lack of a chief disciple to lead the team

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.966
It's better to take this as a prize

13
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.766
I agree with the Lord's proposal

14
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.366
Good apprentice, how about you?

15
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.566
Chief or not, I don't care.

16
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.500
It's just what Brother Li wants

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.666
Then I want good too

18
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.066
Would like to settle this

19
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.666
The winner is my chief disciple of Yuan Men

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.300
The Lord is wise

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.766
Cut the crap

22
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.200
See you in the first five

23
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.100
Kiss you and shine in the original gate martial election

24
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.166
Even the Yan chapter with the loudest voice before

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.366
The limelight of the fairy has been crushed by you. Humph

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.800
Are you afraid that I will be in this Yan Wuchang?

27
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.466
Also stole your limelight

28
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.600
No no no I just want to tell you

29
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.866
The contempt among the disciples

30
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.966
It's not the kind of small fight that was originally impossible

31
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.533
heard

32
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.700
You have slashed the Decepticons in the original door stunt

33
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.466
Reached the point of perfection

34
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.433
It's not perfect.

35
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.100
Just the limelight of killing wild boys

36
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.800
Still believe in teenagers

37
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.000
I want to tell you too

38
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.966
Something you are proud of

39
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.200
Not worth mentioning at all in my eyes

40
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.366
I declare an exchange

41
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.300
Official start
