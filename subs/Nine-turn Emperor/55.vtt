00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.033
Ocean, you're not dead yet

2
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.033
Worried you

3
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.700
No one can be under my tyrant knife

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.833
Can still survive

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.000
That proves that your Decepticons knife is almost there

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.266
You shut up the ocean

7
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.866
Come to the master

8
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.200
I'll see if you're hurt.

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.400
What does the master have to say?

10
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.033
Let me end this battle

11
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.033
Talk about it later

12
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.233
So hard to teach

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.666
Then if I accidentally kill him

14
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.366
Touch my people

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.000
Just kill it

16
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.900
I moved, come on.

17
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.266
I didn't expect you to escape

18
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.733
There may be more things you didn't expect

19
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.000
Gamblers, for example?

20
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.500
Killing is indeed a bit
