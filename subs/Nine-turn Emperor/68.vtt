1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.366
Under such an offensive from Mo'er

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.333
This kid can still not fall behind

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.866
I have some skills

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.200
They can be caught from

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.066
Not yet Mo'er's opponent

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.400
You're a good disciple

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.133
And if it's not for self-cultivation, I can't last 10 tricks

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.866
You think there is only a small difference between the seventh and eighth layers.

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.566
The realm is unknown in my pre-sale sect

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.733
Even Jin Gujing

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.966
Only three or more can defeat Mo'er

12
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.200
Within ten strokes

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.600
Apprentice must

14
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.466
speak out

15
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.300
I heard that Liyuan

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.766
It will devalue your original text to the point where there is no residue left.

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.866
I just insulted Yuan Men for Liyuan

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.966
What do you mean?

19
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.366
The so-called crazy people have their own gods

20
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.000
You Xu are naturally such a wonderful person

21
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.500
To believe such ridiculous words

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.900
Of course I don't believe it.

23
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.266
So I'm in him you mean he can beat Liyuan

24
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.600
Yes, exactly.

25
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.900
Ocean end this battle quickly

26
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.033
Yan Tian is now waiting for your help

27
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.633
That's over

28
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.066
Hahahaha

29
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.866
I didn't expect it.

30
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.466
The little baby is quite brave, eh?

31
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.100
Yan Tianxian

32
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.633
I'm going to ask you one last time.

33
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.166
Are you really unwilling to spend the night with me?

34
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.433
The party is stubborn

35
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:49.200
Then you die with your stubbornness
