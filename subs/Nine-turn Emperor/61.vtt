00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.433
This deputy sect master of Yushou Sect

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.800
It seems that he does not deal with Elder Xu

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.800
Yushou Sect is the first sect in Zhongzhou

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.566
The original gate is the first one in Beijing

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.966
Disputes are common

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.333
The way the former deputy sect master looked at Elder Xu

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.866
It's not as simple as hostility

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.000
Like what

9
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.266
I don't know. It's like

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.566
It's like an abandoned cross country

11
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's how it feels.

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.066
No wonder Yuan Buddhist Sect Master said 30 years

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.866
He Zhan is still in love

14
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:35.033
Keep walking with caution

15
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.200
This is my original door

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.766
Temporary accommodation at the Hundred Doors Dance

17
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.500
Next to it are the major sects

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.966
So in order to avoid unnecessary trouble

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.066
Before the Baimen Club's martial arts began

20
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.433
So people go out as little as possible.

21
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.000
Yes, this cockroach still has the key to deal with.

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.200
Next, you will listen to Han Yang's orders, right?

23
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.033
Come on.

24
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500
Ocean, you are the original chief disciple

25
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.466
This house is yours to live in

26
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.166
Thanks hi

27
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.033
You're welcome. What?

28
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.433
Oh, by the way, you know the process of this hundred doors dancing

29
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.100
I knew you were drunk on cultivation

30
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.200
Ask no questions

31
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.266
I've already asked for you

32
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.433
This Hundred Doors Dance every year

33
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.233
Hundreds at least

34
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.766
Thousands of sects will come to participate

35
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.066
It can be said to be a prosperous era in this Xuanwu Continent

36
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.166
So many people.

37
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.233
Don't make trouble for a long time, right?

38
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:44.766
So to speed things up

39
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.600
The General Assembly stipulates the top ten burdens

40
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.400
You can pass the audition and directly enter the top 100

41
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.033
Now these top 100 are extinct

42
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.266
Who is the first?

43
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:58.200
Of course it's me
