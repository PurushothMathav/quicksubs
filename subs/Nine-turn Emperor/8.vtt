1
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.200
Brother Yang

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.866
Why, Miss?

3
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.966
I can protect you.

4
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.966
But I just want you to live

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.033
I'm just too weak

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.600
Anyone can deceive the sun

7
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.600
After Wu Song

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.866
You must practice well

9
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.133
No.

10
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.233
Do not go

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.300
I can willingly serve you as a soldier

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.800
But you must promise me two conditions

13
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.000
Otherwise, I will die with Brother Yang

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.233
How dare you blackmail me?

15
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.833
Let's just say so.

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.266
My life and Brother Yang's life are more than grass

17
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.966
If you can get your great career in exchange, senior

18
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.966
We are also dead

19
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.033
How dare you!

20
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.366
Wild Dad promises you

21
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.866
Thank you so much.

22
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.500
My first condition is

23
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.433
I want you to break the mirror of Brother Yang once.

24
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.633
You bitch

25
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.200
What a big appetite

26
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.300
A broken mirror

27
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.900
You can break through a big realm alone

28
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.566
How dare you ask for a bottle?

29
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.700
Are you worth that much?

30
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.033
OK

31
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:27.766
I will thank you very much.

32
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.366
So here's my second condition.

33
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.766
I want them both dead

34
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.900
Big niece, we are blood relatives

35
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.666
Forcing us to remember the blood relatives

36
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.366
You're going to kill us?

37
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.366
Did you ever remember the blood relatives?

38
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:03.766
Ask the seniors to fulfill

39
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.100
For the sake of your willingness to become an old body

40
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.833
I'll kill these dragon chairs for you

41
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.700
Uh-huh.

42
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.666
How to forgive

43
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.066
How to forgive

44
00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:19.566
How to forgive

45
00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:20.633
Go find the city lord
