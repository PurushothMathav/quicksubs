00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Humph

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.966
What if you don't like it?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.000
you

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.100
How dare you hit me?

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.566
I wanted to kill you in the ring

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.833
But if you're in a hurry

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.766
I don't mind fulfilling you

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.266
Xie Jun report

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.133
Seventh level also dares to threaten Lao Tzu

10
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.233
How about asking the Ming Dynasty?

11
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.566
Elder Xu, you came just in time

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.200
This Suspense Dao Palace person is too arrogant

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.900
I saw it all

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.033
Whose disciple are you?

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:37.233
Respect the teacher Xuanyi Palace Tianxiang Hall Elder Huo Lingzi humph

16
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.800
It turned out to be Huo Lingzi's apprentice

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800
You tell Huo Lingzi

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.633
If he can't discipline his apprentice

19
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.233
I can do it for you.

20
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.766
Senior's words

21
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.266
I must represent

22
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.633
You have something else to do

23
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.433
junior

24
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.266
retire

25
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.033
Chen Qiaoqian, I'm going to order

26
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.366
But before that

27
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.966
I don't mind having him first.

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.166
I've seen a lot of arrogant people like you

29
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.866
In the end they all died

30
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.366
You will be no exception

31
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.200
Hahaha, see you in the ring.

32
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.466
Elder Xu is too arrogant

33
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.500
He entered Beijing before the age of 25

34
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700
Naturally, there is an arrogant capital

35
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.566
Even so

36
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.866
You can't bully the weak

37
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.866
law of the jungle

38
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.400
Strength is not respected

39
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.866
This is the path that cultivates feelings and is more constant

40
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.166
If you don't agree

41
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:45.766
You have to become stronger than him

42
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.366
Let someone arrange it.

43
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.000
Game 1

44
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.500
I want to be in the same ring as that woman

45
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.466
reject me

46
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.100
Then I will destroy you
