1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.700
I need a carriage

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.500
There are still thousands of miles away from the Suspense Dao Bow

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.800
Even if you travel day and night

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.200
It also takes 3 months.

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.900
In addition, some aggregation orders are required.

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.433
It is difficult to raise intrinsic units, bills, etc

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.866
If you need anything else, go back and tell the master.

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.666
This Chiba Excalibur cannot be returned for the time being

9
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.466
Okay, give me three days to prepare.

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.566
Thank you, Elder Xu

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.200
You are the best disciple of my generation

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.466
He will also be the sect master of Yuan Men in the future

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.766
This is what we elders should do

14
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.766
You have been well healed for the past three days

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.100
Consolidate the realm

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.100
The carriage has everything you need

18
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.366
And some entanglement

19
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.700
Follow this road all the way west

20
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.866
There are my original affiliated forces within a thousand miles

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.500
You have Chiba Excalibur

22
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.500
You can ask them anything.

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.600
You're on your own going forward.

24
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.466
Thank you, sir

25
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.966
I was groomed to be determined

26
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.600
Since you choose to do it, you have no hesitation

27
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.033
Don't look back

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.366
Jin Zun Presbyterian Church Ocean

29
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.700
I'll wait for you at Yuanmen

30
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.766
Bring my sister-in-law back

31
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.566
OK

32
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.566
Lao Zhao, you too

33
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.266
Elder Xu, fellow disciples and brothers

34
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.766
It's getting late.

35
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.300
It's time for me to go.

36
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.066
Yuan Sect disciples obey orders

37
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.900
Anyang goes thousands of miles away

38
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.433
Yang I Yuan Men's Danger

39
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.966
All disciples should do their best as a half-teacher

40
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:29.933
salute

41
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.400
Congratulations to the chief
