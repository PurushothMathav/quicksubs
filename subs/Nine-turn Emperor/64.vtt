1
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.000
You haven't slept yet?

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.366
Do you want to ask today?

3
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.166
Chen Qiaoqian in his mouth today

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Is it my wife?

5
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.666
Yes, my wife is still in Suspense Dao Palace

6
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.833
Then I will solve this matter by myself

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.100
But you were targeted by the pear garden

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.633
I'm afraid so.

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.933
In this game, he will definitely achieve the means

10
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.466
If you meet him directly on the playing field

11
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.833
Air race

12
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.766
Do you think

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.000
I am afraid of death

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.100
You are so young that you have already stepped into Migu Tsing Yi

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.533
There is no doubt about talent or perseverance

16
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.333
But

17
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.100
There is a big difference between not being afraid of death and dying

18
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.000
But you are only half a year older than me

19
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.600
Let me tell you something.

20
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.600
What was it three months ago?

21
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.800
I'm still a broken piece of golden wheat

22
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.633
Broken golden wheat

23
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.366
Then you so

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400
You don't have to fight me

25
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.100
Mark my words

26
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.833
If you encounter Liyuan

27
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.333
direct gas race

28
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.200
No shame

29
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.100
It's getting late.

30
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.300
We have to play tomorrow

31
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.166
The Hundred Doors Club is about to begin

32
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.300
Please come forward and draw lots

33
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.833
Picking an opponent

34
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.100
lottery rules

35
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
Those who draw the same number are competitors on the same stage

36
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.166
Now I announce that the lottery ceremony will now begin

37
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:56.766
I am number seventy-three

38
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.366
How about you, number 17?

39
00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.166
How about you?

40
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.233
Miss Yan Bianqian

41
00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:03.033
What's your number?

42
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.100
What does his number have to do with you?

43
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.566
I am number 80.

44
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:09.266
How about you, Miss Yan Panxian?

45
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.100
What number are you?
