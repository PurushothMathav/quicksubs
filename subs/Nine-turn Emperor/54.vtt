00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:08.400
Playing that sword finger led Li Yao back to Gao Yi

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.900
It also completely shattered Li Yao's pride

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.700
Let him

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.200
Murdered in a hurry

5
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.500
Li Yao stop

6
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.700
Okay, that's it.

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.866
You want to kill

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.966
Stop him now

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.833
Li Yao's sword service has been completed

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.600
Unless he stops voluntarily

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.600
Otherwise, anyone who wants to stop him will have to kill him

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.266
You're a genius for hurting me

13
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.766
But you also need to know

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:35.066
The genius who survives is the real genius

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.466
Too bad you don't have a chance

16
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.266
You say if you die

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.300
How miserable are they?

18
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.966
Too bad I can't see it again

19
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:51.500
Then I'll tell you after I kill you

20
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.300
Li Yao, you dare to kill my beloved disciple

21
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.600
I killed your master

22
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.133
Elder Xu, how dare you stop me?

23
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.200
Li Yao ignored the rules

24
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.100
You and my apprentice Li Yao ignore the rules

25
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.300
Own door rule disposal

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.500
Can be used as a leader

27
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.800
How can you hurt your disciples?

28
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.666
Please calm down

29
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.466
i

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.700
No grass grows under the knife

31
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.166
Yeah.

32
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.900
Don't stop me, I'm going to save him.

33
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.433
You can't save him

34
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.266
Lime even lost his own life

35
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.600
Then I'm going too.

36
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.033
It's better than doing nothing here

37
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.633
Y'all forgot

38
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.966
You still owe him your life

39
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.000
I didn't forget

40
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.700
What else?

41
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.100
I'll kill you!
