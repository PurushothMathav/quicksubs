00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.466
What? This kid can actually break the organization's advice?

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.766
Why is this Chiba Excalibur so violent?

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.366
Because he was angry

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.900
To teach a lesson to those who provoke him

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.466
Chiba Excalibur is angry

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.933
I had no choice.

7
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.133
Never encountered before

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.000
Originally no choice

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.033
For hundreds of years

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.266
Who can look back and break like him

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.400
Patriarch sees you

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.700
Wow, the ocean is amazing.

13
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.633
This will definitely solve the housewarming

14
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.866
Me and him

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.033
Like the difference between cloud and soil

16
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.566
Just like me

17
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.866
Climbing the ladder into the idle courtyard

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.666
stroll

19
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.166
Is it recommended to eat and drink water?

20
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.666
In front of him

21
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.900
Who dares to become a genius?

22
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:58.033
Only geniuses who grow up are called geniuses

23
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.966
Those who do not grow up are called dead

24
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:07.200
Only when I saw him did I know what wonderful righteousness is

25
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.766
You are the apprentice I like

26
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.033
Nature is extraordinary

27
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.800
Let's see, Senno Divine Sword is completely enraged

28
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.300
You want to use the sword formation

29
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300
To teach a lesson to someone who challenges your dignity?

30
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.533
If so

31
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.766
Then come on.

32
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.766
Panyang breaks it with strength

33
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.833
It's a prison.

34
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:31.700
It's not good to crush him if you have the sword medicine

35
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.800
Hanyang boy

36
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.266
Forever to Hell

37
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.466
I was born

38
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.633
Providence is also sharper than me
