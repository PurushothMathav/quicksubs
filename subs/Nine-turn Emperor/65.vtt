1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.500
you

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.933
You're kidding, you're questioning

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.500
Is the fairness of this Hundred Doors Meeting?

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.466
Don't talk nonsense

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.500
This cannot be left unresolved.

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.866
I'm going to find Elder Xu

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.766
Stop talking but he

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.633
If you don't want to throw in the towel before you even get on stage

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.100
Let's make a deal

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.333
What deal?

11
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.666
Pay me 10,000 I can get you through

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.366
How am I just a villain

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.733
You are just a dream

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.866
If you want to die

15
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.600
I can fulfill you in the next game.

16
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.700
We admit defeat in your game

17
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.233
Concubine before the war

18
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.666
Yuan Men's next generation is just like this

19
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.500
When the lottery is over

20
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.133
Please ask each sect to fight accordingly

21
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.066
Taiwan participates in the competition

22
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.166
If the time of a stick of incense is for the stage

23
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.400
as an automaton

24
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.733
If you want Yuan Men to dance at the Hundred Gate Meeting

25
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.066
Facial teacher

26
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.266
Can be violated

27
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.000
Hahahahaha

28
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.666
Too arrogant

29
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.000
I got the Commander's Medal

30
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.200
He dared to do it so blatantly

31
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.066
Are not afraid that we will pick up and expose

32
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.400
Video first

33
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.666
Remember what we said last night

34
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.400
Do everything as we said

35
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.800
Okay, it's getting late.

36
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.433
Let's all get ready
