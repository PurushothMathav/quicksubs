1
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.400
Can hold on

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.266
How many knots?

3
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:09.700
Exactly level 20

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.466
20 said so

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.100
I can become an outer court disciple

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.933
If I could brew more hidden sword intent

7
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.666
Not to mention the original ladder

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.300
Even if you actually climb the ladder

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.966
I can also help you get to the top

10
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.366
Ocean

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.433
You helped me.

12
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.733
Ocean leave me alone

13
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.233
Go to the top yourself

14
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.400
You don't want to go to the top?

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.100
But I'd rather see you surpass him

16
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.033
First to the top

17
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.666
Well, then I'll surpass him

18
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.833
Look at this child climbing the ladder alone

19
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.166
You are so optimistic about resigning

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.366
I don't know why

21
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.166
I think this child is at the top

22
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.400
Even what

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.066
Even the first to reach the summit
