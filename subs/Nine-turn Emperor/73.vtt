1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.600
Let me go! I'm going to save him

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.033
Liyuan's three knives and one small success

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.666
Bombing the sun but the jade valley

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.966
No chance of survival

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.066
If he doesn't die

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.700
The future achievements are limitless

7
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.366
It's a pity that fallen geniuses are not even as good as dust

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.300
My spirit son

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.000
What advice does Fellow Daoist Xu have?

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.700
Your Excellency handed over such an excellent apprentice

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.666
Xu is ashamed

12
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:28.066
But Xu also wants to ask Your Excellency for advice

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.100
It just so happens that I have been waiting for 30 years

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.600
Xu Zhenglao, look at the stand

15
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.200
And also

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.300
He's still alive.

17
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.433
What is still alive?

18
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.366
A mere mouth of seven dynasties

19
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.266
Can you take off both my ends?

20
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.400
That's not possible.

21
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.633
The realm has always limited you servants

22
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.800
Instead of convincing us that genius is good

23
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.066
Will cut the monk with the third knife

24
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.233
When I don't know what to do

25
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.266
Although Han Yang was lucky enough to carry two knives

26
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.500
But he didn't know about these three swords

27
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.600
A knife is stronger than a knife

28
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.566
The third knife slashes Amano
