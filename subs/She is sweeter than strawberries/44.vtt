Chen

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.533
What's the matter with Miss Shen?

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.166
Did you do the thing that Tiantian was scalded?

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.200
Why do you doubt me?

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.500
Yesterday, Brother Rong got a recording

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.100
Come to me and ask for guilt

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.866
Someone pretended to be me to bribe the waiter

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.400
You and Tiantian are now competing for the director position

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.666
You don't like him and want to teach him a lesson

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.400
I never got along with him

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.266
So you framed me and buried me

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.866
I want Brother Rong to think that I did the right thing, right?

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.633
I thought we were the good luck front

14
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.500
I didn't expect you to doubt me too

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.700
So how do you explain it?

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.700
You just dodged it when Tiantian happened

17
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.166
This is too coincidental

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.266
That means I'm lucky

19
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.733
In fact, I also doubted it.

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.700
Have passion

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.633
I wonder if you did it

22
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.666
I really want to teach him a lesson

23
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.333
But I won't make such a big noise

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.033
It doesn't do me any good.

25
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.033
It's not you.

26
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.500
This kind of harmful thing

27
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.966
Why should I do it?

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.466
Burned sweet

29
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.033
Make yourself angry

30
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.766
Am I that stupid?

31
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.966
And you're the future wife of the president

32
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.466
I'm still counting on your support

33
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Didn't I lose my backer by harming you?

34
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.066
Someone must want us to turn against each other

35
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.966
I must find this person
