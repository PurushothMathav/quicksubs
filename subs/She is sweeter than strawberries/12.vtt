00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.400
The president's brain was kicked by a donkey, right?

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.200
I didn't mean that

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.200
I mean you and Miss Shen are a perfect match

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.400
Must die

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.900
Do you have a passport?

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.000
passport

7
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.300
Could it be that the truth Shen Wanzi said

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.466
The Rong family can't accommodate my child

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.800
You want to pressure me to go abroad, I, I, I don't have a passport.

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.900
And I have never planned to go abroad.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.866
I am not used to Western food.

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.133
If I go abroad

13
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.800
I will definitely starve to death

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.066
I thought you were easy to support

15
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.866
Not picky eaters

16
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.766
I'm not a picky eater.

17
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.533
Anything as long as it's Chinese food

18
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.600
Western food is not good

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.300
So I definitely can't go abroad

20
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.600
I won't go even if I'm forced to die

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.133
OK

22
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.666
Aren't you going to the Paris jewelry fair next month?

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.466
Paris Jewelry Fair

24
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.433
You mean the world's No. 1 jewelry fair?

25
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.066
You mean let me take my passport with me?

26
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.566
I also said if you do a good job this time

27
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.033
I could consider making you my ancestor

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.700
But if you don't want to go

29
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.500
I can find my work

30
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.166
Stand out this time

31
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.466
I can get a foothold in jewelry fairs

32
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.500
65 years old

33
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.800
If you have a son

34
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.366
It should be just for next time.

35
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.233
What do you want now?

36
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.200
Mr. Wang, I went out to work today

37
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.466
I will apply for my passport tomorrow

38
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:36.233
I know you're not a peaceful thing

39
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.400
Arrange a few people for me

40
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.466
President, it has been arranged in Switzerland.

41
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.766
When the time comes to transfer Miss Joe from Paris to Switzerland

42
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:47.700
Secret labor

43
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.100
You will feel at ease

44
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
One word is enough to give me a headache

45
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.700
Now here comes another like a brother

46
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.833
He will get better and better if he stays here

47
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900
Hey, what material?

48
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.500
Sister Jojo has been kidnapped
