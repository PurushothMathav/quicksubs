1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.666
The wedding will take place in two months

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.100
Yes

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.166
Does Mr. Rong still want this child?

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.233
It's just a number.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.066
One more, not much.

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.233
A lot less of him

7
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.300
Baby dad

8
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.800
It will be investigated, right?

9
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.333
He will find the second treasure, right?

10
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.233
We should trust dad, right?

11
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.033
Right?

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.666
It's just a number.

13
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.866
One more, not much.

14
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.000
I thought Rong

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.866
Always secretly married to Joanne

16
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.200
Think too much

17
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.300
A bitch who is entangled with my brother

18
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.600
What qualifications do you have to be my wife?

19
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.366
I love sweet

20
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.066
Aren't you going to save the child?

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.000
No one can threaten me

22
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.566
Mr. Rong, Miss Tian, will be engaged the day after tomorrow

23
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.766
Get married in two months

24
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.966
Why so Chen Su?

25
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:09.700
Tiantian is pregnant

26
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.200
I don't want my children to die.

27
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.900
Mr. Rong has a soft spot for the daughter of the Tian family

28
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:25.766
If you want girls to come ashore

29
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.466
I will keep you from seeing

30
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.433
Don't let the dragon only know

31
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.866
Why did you lie to me?

32
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.433
Did you know that Erbao was still alive?

33
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.033
Did you not even think about saving him?

34
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.433
I have my own opportunities

35
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.233
Your own plan

36
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.666
Just marry Tiantian

37
00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.033
Have more children, right?

38
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.600
A woman like me doesn't deserve to have children with you at all

39
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.733
So the baby I have doesn't matter at all

40
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.166
Right so

41
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.600
You have to be born with a baby.

42
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.800
What you have to do is Zhao Guangda

43
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.033
Other things are not needed.

44
00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:20.766
At that time, I was pregnant with

45
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.633
A child born through hard work

46
00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.566
What if he were you?

47
00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:52.466
Isn't it time for a divorce?

48
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.600
It's almost time for your engagement gift

49
00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:57.033
Are you

50
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.200
The divorce agreement

51
00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:01.133
Give it to me as reasonable.

52
00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.100
I was sick.

53
00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:04.266
If you want a divorce

54
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.366
I'm going out now
