00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:02.800
Baby

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.233
Although mom has been unable to stay by your side

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.600
But I still don't want to be too far away from you.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.300
So I'm not going to stay abroad.

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.433
Will not die

6
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.466
Jasmine

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.866
Come here.

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.900
Finger.

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.500
foot

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.100
I sit.

11
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.600
Don't come here again

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100
Don't force me to meet again

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.100
Come here again.

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.566
I'll kill myself and show you

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.633
You put the knife down first

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.466
You will find out about your pregnancy sooner or later when you return home.

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.600
I don't know how many people there will be

18
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.100
Will harm you and your child

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.166
I let you go to Switzerland

20
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.666
It's for the safety of you and your children

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.766
Is it safe abroad?

22
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.200
You were in danger yesterday

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.366
A person's lonely self

24
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.500
I have already died.

25
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.266
I don't want to stay abroad anymore.

26
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.300
Ok I'll take you

27
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.700
Promise so simply

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.133
It's not just to coax me

29
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.233
I mean what I say.

30
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.066
So give me the knife

31
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.000
This kind of thing must not happen again in the future

32
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.866
It's all because of you

33
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:36.666
Mo Li

34
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.900
Azhi

35
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.200
I didn't expect you to come to Joanne in such a mess

36
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.766
It seems that he is quite important to you

37
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.200
I have always cherished talent

38
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.600
Qiao Ann is a designer that our company focuses on training.

39
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.000
He was in trouble yesterday.

40
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.666
But my epidemic is solved

41
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.533
Are you sure Joanne is alright?

42
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:55.333
OK

43
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.833
Thanks.

44
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.700
If it weren't for you yesterday, I would have slept on the street

45
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.900
We are friends and should help each other

46
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.200
Have any questions?

47
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.566
You can ask me for help

48
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.833
It's getting late.

49
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:10.066
Go quickly

50
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.500
Ah, after returning home, I will cook and invite you to dinner myself

51
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.300
As emotion

52
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.233
Be careful, cat
