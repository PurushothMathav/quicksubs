1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.566
I am pursuing him.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.400
If successful

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.766
Here he is.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.533
Mr. Yang, you are in such a hurry to call me back

5
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.000
Do you want to praise me in advance or give me a promotion and a raise?

6
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.300
What's left?

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.600
Do you have a medicine cabinet?

8
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.500
I'll look for it

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.300
I'm already flying a plane to take you on a trip

10
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.766
You'll be driving there in a while

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.566
I'm not going, I'm just an agreement with you to observe.

12
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.633
You are not eligible to ask

13
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.533
I can't help but go

14
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.200
Switzerland is the safest place for children

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.000
What's more, it can prevent you from attracting bees and butterflies

16
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.300
Don't let no three be four

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.300
So is that why you called me back?

18
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.066
Are you qualified?

19
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.566
I divorce you, don't worry

20
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.266
Before the baby is born

21
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.766
You have no choice.

22
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.300
If you take it back for yourself

23
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.233
Or I'll take you back and get out

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.166
You thought you ran away from here

25
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.800
Receive the sacrifice of a mother

26
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.600
He doesn't love you at all

27
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.633
He's using you.

28
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.366
This man in front of me and Mullis

29
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.366
What kind of person is he?

30
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.266
You are the hardest

31
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.266
He is this holy best to me

32
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.900
He is a thousand times better than you

33
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.033
A thousand times better than you

34
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.366
A thousand times a thousand times

35
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:27.800
OK

36
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.466
Earn 1,000 bucks

37
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.000
Somebody take him to the airport
