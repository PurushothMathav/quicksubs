00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:01.833
Ah!

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.033
How to do what to do

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.766
I can't let my brother find out

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.400
dragon

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.333
I'm leaving please

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.133
Please, please.

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.200
Come to our room and wait a moment, okay?

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.800
Head head please please

9
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.566
Forgot to give it to you

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
Is my sister surprised?

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.100
Is it surprising?

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.900
Of course, surprise.

13
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.200
If you come later

14
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.366
You have to say hello to me in advance

15
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.766
I share this house with someone else

16
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.166
We all agreed in advance

17
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.200
If a friend comes, let me know in advance

18
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.733
Wow, your house is too big, isn't it?

19
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.566
There is a swimming pool and a sky garden.

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.166
Keep it down.

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.900
My roommate is at work

22
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.933
By the way, how's your job going?

23
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.366
Hey, sister, don't worry.

24
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.966
I have Munich taking care of me everywhere

25
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.166
No one dares to embarrass me

26
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.000
And I have to record a variety show tomorrow.

27
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.533
Just wait for your brothers

28
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.066
Then try to be as active as possible when you are on the scene

29
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.366
That way there will be more shots.

30
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.500
But don't be too deliberate

31
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.800
Otherwise, it will leave a bad impression on the audience.

32
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.600
Be careful

33
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.600
Hey, how much is it?

34
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.033
Stage search for so many years

35
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.666
Do you have the idea of falling in love?
