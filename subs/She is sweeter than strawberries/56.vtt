00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.800
Ah!

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.066
Rong always goes to the club next door to play golf

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.866
Just passing by, right?

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.700
When we were kids, my dad used to take us to be female

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.100
Brothers play golf together

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.966
Since his old man passed away

7
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.433
We never went together again

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.500
When are you free?

9
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.766
In this way, the eldest brother and the third brother will get together later.

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.266
Next week.

11
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.100
Next week happens to be the old man's anniversary

12
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.966
And he's up there watching us all.

13
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:24.966
He is happy

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.800
It's getting late.

15
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800
I woke up

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.933
Must avoid books at night

17
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.900
Or I'll pick you up myself

18
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.033
You took my child out at night

19
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.766
With my permission

20
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.400
Didn't I tell Mr. Liu?

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.766
He didn't turn to you.

22
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.033
If there is such a thing in the future, you have to report it in person.

23
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.966
Mr. Long, please respect my freedom, okay?

24
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.166
I don't care where you go

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.200
But I have absolute custody of the children

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.300
They are relaxed

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.033
I have to manage strictly

28
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.900
I'm tired I want to rest

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.200
You put me down

30
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.900
I have feet. I can walk.

31
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.066
Don't be affectionate

32
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.266
I'm holding my parents' child now, not

33
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.400
Mr. Long, go out

34
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.466
I want to sleep

35
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.966
Stop pretending you eat like this

36
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.533
What happened today must give your mother a clear understanding

37
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.400
Who is his real son-in-law?

38
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.166
Save unnecessary misunderstandings

39
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.600
Don't worry.

40
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.800
No matter how much my mother picks a son-in-law, she won't pick you

41
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.733
What kind of partner is he looking for for his daughter?

42
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:46.866
It's pretty clear.

43
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.866
I will never fantasize about climbing a boss like you

44
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.700
Discharge over there
