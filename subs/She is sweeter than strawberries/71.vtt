1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.366
I want to wait until we get divorced

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.500
I will try to accept him.

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.100
Rong Qiuyue is not a good person

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.433
He's not your two

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.900
Then I think

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.933
Shen Wan

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.600
Quitting is more suitable for being the wife of a free president than being sweet

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.133
Then you don't want Shen Wanci, the original partner.

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.500
Her name is Tingting

10
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.633
Did you get kicked in the head by a donkey?

11
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.033
Shen Wanci is the original match, what are you?

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.400
No matter what I am, he is a mistress every day

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.433
You are a

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.266
You are a scum

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.566
I'm telling you, sometimes I just want to strangle you

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.500
Humph get out

17
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.433
I'm a fucking virgin

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.900
I gave my first kiss to this family

19
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.833
And full of scum

20
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.166
Listen to Ershang

21
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.300
Wait until the baby is born

22
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.166
You go to Malta to get married?

23
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.066
You had an unplanned pregnancy.

24
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.033
Or plan for an accident

25
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.800
Aren't you trying to get pregnant?

26
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.866
Why is there good news?

27
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.033
It just happened to be a warm period these days.

28
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.366
Maybe.

29
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.900
It's all there.

30
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.400
I must find a way to stop the pain

31
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.866
When it's time to get pregnant

32
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.266
I can't if he doesn't marry me

33
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:30.933
Ah!

34
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:32.766
lipolysis

35
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.966
Can you be normal?

36
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.033
My kids are scared by you

37
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.866
Tomorrow, I plan to buy a set with Sube

38
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.666
Isn't the dragon always the same?

39
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.466
As long as you are there

40
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.066
Marry me at home

41
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.200
You are deliberately making me angry.

42
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.666
I wouldn't dare to.

43
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.133
Only really good to me

44
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.866
The man who is dedicated to me

45
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.266
And worthy of my end

46
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.433
Can't do it

47
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.500
Don't stop me from finding the end

48
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.266
ask you

49
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.000
I hope you let me know your heart

50
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.666
I don't want to be where you put him

51
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.800
I never thought about how many catties I have myself

52
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.733
I know very well

53
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:10.933
Your wife?

54
00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.433
It should be a wealthy daughter who is right for you

55
00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.066
Instead of a little grassroots like me

56
00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.600
Do me one thing

57
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.966
I'll give you 1 million

58
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.800
Cao An doesn't care who you are pregnant with

59
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.266
They never got a chance.
