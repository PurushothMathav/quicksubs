00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.566
I just need to go to the bathroom

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.766
It's okay, I'll take you to the hospital.

3
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.700
Why did he hold him?

4
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.233
My heart is sore

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.633
It must be because I drank too much juice

6
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:29.666
Ann, you don't look in a good mood today.

7
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.866
Are you having a conflict with the young master?

8
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:35.300
Too many things have happened to Mrs. Liu recently

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.400
I don't understand him anymore

10
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.400
Anana

11
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.000
Master, this person?

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.566
The size should be strong.

13
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.900
A lot of words are hidden in my heart

14
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.766
Actually, he doesn't have a bad heart

15
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.700
He really likes you too

16
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.300
You said he likes me

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.133
You can see the number of times he comes here.

18
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.966
More times than going home

19
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.100
Maybe.

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.033
He feels a sense of belonging by your side

21
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.366
I watched him get angry for you

22
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.666
This kind of thing must not happen again in the future

23
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.333
Looking at you making a fuss, what nonsense are you talking about?

24
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.366
Even the former lady

25
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.066
He never cared so much

26
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.566
An An, you have to check your heart carefully

27
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.033
How could he like me?

28
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.200
He can't possibly like me.

29
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.266
How about sweet?

30
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.566
It's not serious, just a little skin trauma

31
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.166
I really didn't do this.

32
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.466
I don't doubt you.

33
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.166
Otherwise I wouldn't have come.

34
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.533
Did you talk to Rong Xuewei again after I left?

35
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:50.600
He's my friend.

36
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.266
Get to know the people of the Rong family through him

37
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:53.466
Is there already a benefit?

38
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:56.266
Can't trust anyone but me

39
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.566
Especially Rong Xuewei

40
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.700
I heard you were assassinated

41
00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:05.633
Who is the murderer?
