00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.066
Mu Li really wants to thank you this time.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.566
My brother was in his junior year of dragon drama

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.900
Then he was suspended from school for two and a half years due to illness

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.333
Just got back recently

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.666
His classmate deliberately asked him to come to the gold test

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.700
Just to humiliate him

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.566
If it weren't for you

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:16.933
He just

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.166
I happen to know a good agent

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.466
I'll talk to him later.

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.100
Arrange for him to meet your brother

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.100
he

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:30.833
Shouldn't it be in your Rong's media company?

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.600
Why don't you want him to join Long's Media?

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.666
It's okay if I join the team alone

16
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.600
Can't let my brother jump in

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.266
Mr. Wang is cold

18
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.800
I hope he finds a warmer one.

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.333
But you are fine

20
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.900
I'm sure I'm not worried

21
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.666
OK, that's it.

22
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.733
Yes, thank you.

23
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.833
I'll go first then.

24
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.866
Slow down

25
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.466
Xiuyuan, my aunt will return to China this weekend

26
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.500
Then you can go somewhere with me.

27
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:39.466
Xiao Mo

28
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.133
Is that okay?

29
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:51.566
Mom, this person's walking figure is really amazing

30
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.100
You are not only greedy for money, but also lustful

31
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.366
Do you still want me?

32
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:03.666
or

33
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.000
Let's talk more.

34
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.666
Hey, hey, Mr. Wang

35
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.900
This is us, our aunt.

36
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.833
It's not suitable for a man and a widow to be in the same room

37
00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.366
What's inappropriate?

38
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:17.366
reasonable and legal

39
00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.166
Or do you want to question and call up

40
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.966
The velvet player in the inner gutter

41
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.533
You have a fiancee yourself

42
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:25.466
You also hooked up with your little white moonlight

43
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.933
Sorry to say me

44
00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:28.800
Muli and I are just good friends

45
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.166
It's not as dirty as you think.

46
00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:33.566
Dirty you say I'm dirty

47
00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:35.900
Then I'll show you my dirty mind
