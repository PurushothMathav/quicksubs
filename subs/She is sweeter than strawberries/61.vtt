00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.866
Yesterday

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.400
A serious traffic accident occurred on Fuhai Road

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.466
Dead is burned sweet day retro deep

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.633
He was all burned

5
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.466
It can't be silenced, can it?

6
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:20.066
I know the police have ruled out homicide

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.000
Thunder is the reason for the traffic accident

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.066
But this woman bit to death and said I appointed it.

9
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.700
The other party must have given him a lot of money

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.433
Don't tell the truth until you die

11
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.400
Then it's dead

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.233
It's even more difficult for you to welcome the previous reinforcements

13
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.000
Ah hey

14
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.400
Do you know what Brother Long is doing now?

15
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.800
He's kissing me at the racecourse

16
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.600
I'm pissed off.

17
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.400
I went looking for them and got kicked out

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.800
You see

19
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.300
Prenatal education at night

20
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.066
It's true to fall in love during the day

21
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.566
What are you eating? Such a strong perfume.

22
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.166
I haven't just gotten out of the sweet bed

23
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.666
What's the matter? Silent today

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.166
Nothing.

25
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.500
Haven't you always thought I was ugly?

26
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:31.766
Hey no

27
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.400
Who provoked you?

28
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.800
Get so angry

29
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.200
This is you.

30
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.700
Bad for my child

31
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.266
Stop playing, stop playing and sleep

32
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:49.333
sleep

33
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:03.600
If a normal twitter

34
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.666
Talk endlessly

35
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.600
And he teases you and the people who argue with you at every turn

36
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.166
Suddenly silent

37
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:10.833
Bored like a bad guy where is it

38
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.566
What's going on?

39
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.600
That must be angry

40
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.766
Inexplicably angry

41
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.033
How could I care about this?

42
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.866
Who cares that you are used to bah

43
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:40.933
redo

44
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.366
If you don't do it well in the next second, stop for me

45
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:44.500
Don't talk nonsense

46
00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.266
Hey

47
00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:49.500
president

48
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.000
How can you, a woman, be angry? It's easy to coax

49
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.066
A small gift, a candlelight dinner

50
00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.533
Madam's money may be gone

51
00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:56.733
Madam just went to the cafeteria for dinner

52
00:02:56.733 --> 00:02:58.166
Do you want to be angry?

53
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.333
Do you think I need to let you

54
00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:01.100
Teach me to coax

55
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.766
A woman who doesn't take care of her at all?

56
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:05.366
Well, President, I'm leaving first.

57
00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:06.600
Wait a minute.

58
00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:09.300
It's lunch time.

59
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.600
Did you accompany me?
