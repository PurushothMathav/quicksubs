Brother Wen

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.866
I'm blackmailing you about Joanne's boy

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.333
I went and had them tie him up

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.666
Then I want to thank you.

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.733
But you don't have to find someone to kidnap him

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.966
The doctor will abort his baby later

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.400
You really want to

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.000
That's your only healthy child.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.766
What do you think?

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.466
Cats and dogs are eligible to have children with me, right?

11
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.933
That would be fine.

12
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.166
Lest he pester you with the child thing

13
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.566
Mr. Liu has twins in his belly

14
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.500
You see, these are the heads of two children.

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
This is a little hand, don't lose it.

16
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.266
Turns out I'm pregnant with twins

17
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.233
What a pity!

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.800
Humph, it's best if the child is gone.

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.200
I have to find a way to get rid of it

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.700
Is the child really gone?

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.066
The child is not you

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.566
What are you crying about?

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.866
Ahhh hurry

24
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.066
Keep the money in your bank card tight

25
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.433
Turn it all around for me

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.266
The doctor is calling again

27
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.133
Said not to pay today?

28
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.533
To kick your brother out

29
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.200
Go to your friend immediately and pick up more money.

30
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.066
Do you hear me?

31
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.800
Hello, Mom.

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600
Hello

33
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.866
I ran out of money.

34
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.766
How could I make you borrow money like that?

35
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.133
Mr. Rong

36
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.166
The child is gone

37
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.866
Can you?

38
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:56.300
Lend me money

39
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.700
You really want money

40
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.033
Tell me, how much does it cost?

41
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.266
100,000

42
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.233
Ah no 80,000

43
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.600
I will definitely return it to you when I have the money.

44
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:12.566
sign

45
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.400
Why prenuptial agreements?

46
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.300
After the child is born, get a divorce and take grandpa to the south

47
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:22.566
You, you mean the child is not lost.
