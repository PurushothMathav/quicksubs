00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.800
After so long

2
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.900
He's your only two misfit kids

3
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.900
Okay, let's go.

4
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.100
When I remarried

5
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.866
Can the kids help me build a house?

6
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.466
You have to wait until you grow up to be able to live a few messes

7
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.800
Let's talk about the disc type.

8
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.566
Die now

9
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.700
Yo

10
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.200
Looking at your belly, I thought you were pregnant

11
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.533
Yesterday, Emma told me

12
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.200
He saw you and Mr. Rong coming out of the Maternal and Child Health Hospital

13
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.966
You gave me a fright.

14
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.366
I was also taken aback

15
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.100
But if Mr. Rong can't hear this

16
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.266
The big deal is to let you go to an actor's mental class

17
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.866
I just want to give it to me with self-control

18
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.300
To do real estate

19
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.000
Yeah, did I mean him too? I read it wrong.

20
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.133
Even if I do have self-control

21
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:38.100
Mr. Long will not accompany you to the maternity care hospital to see a doctor

22
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.066
You say master

23
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.100
Manager Tian is right

24
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.300
How could Mr. Rong take me as a member?

25
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.400
The worker is in it.

26
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.666
But I have something to ask you

27
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.700
I can't tell you about Hong Jinrong

28
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:00.866
I'm not that free

29
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.733
This afternoon?

30
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:04.400
Brother Rongzi and I are going to the horse farm to see Honey

31
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.700
Besides, I don't care about your personal affairs either

32
00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:22.233
Why do I always think he's hiding some secret?
