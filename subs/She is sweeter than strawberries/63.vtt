00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
President, you flew back from the bag in Paris Curry

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.433
Wait what

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.866
Well not the president

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.933
I looked into the lady's eyes

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.233
This 6-point excellent estimate is

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.066
Are you free?

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.666
Otherwise, you go to Africa and then you want to get out

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.466
Walk away. A woman gets angry for no reason

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.866
I cried for so long

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.900
You sent me WeChat that day.

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.366
Said that the lady was sulking for no reason

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.000
It just so happened that you and Tiantian went to the horse farm

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.600
Although it is a fake play

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.866
But the lady didn't know he was jealous

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:36.966
president

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.966
I'll also send you

17
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.900
I'll say it again.

18
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.400
It seems that I can only add to the fire

19
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.966
Mr. Wang, do you have anything to do with me?

20
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.033
Ah, how are things going for this original series?

21
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.066
Do you have the confidence to dress like this?

22
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.066
In production and processing.

23
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.466
Everything is normal.

24
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.100
It has to be something new.

25
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.033
How else would I go about this process of organization?

26
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.566
Don't think about it, don't think about it.

27
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.633
Hey, you have nothing to say to me

28
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.333
OK

29
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.600
Thank you for the bag you gave me.

30
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.800
Yes, I like it very much.

31
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.433
I also have a gift for you.

32
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.666
I designed this myself last night.

33
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.466
How about sincerity?

34
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.366
That's not bad.

35
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.700
The blue one is the Earth.

36
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.433
Yellow represents the moon

37
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.666
The earth and the moon orbit each other

38
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.066
Mutual attraction never separates

39
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:47.533
Ah!

40
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:52.266
But diamonds are too expensive I can't afford them I'm too poor

41
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.500
So I took the gem.

42
00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:56.766
But also spent a lot of money

43
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.533
You should smile more

44
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:02.833
How beautiful it is.

45
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.400
I ask every day

46
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.166
Is it because you are jealous?

47
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.166
Now don't get me wrong.

48
00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:18.666
How could I possibly be jealous?

49
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:21.100
I, I, I, I have always adhered to that agreement

50
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.600
I've never performed well.

51
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.400
and

52
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.900
Even if you are the only man left in the world

53
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.066
I won't have any jokes for you either.

54
00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.266
Yoko help

55
00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:46.433
My brakes failed on the highway. I
