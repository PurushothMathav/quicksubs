00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.633
Ahhh

2
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:18.633
Ahhhh!

3
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800
Where are you going? Jiang Yang is divorced.

4
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.400
We don't matter

5
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.600
You are not allowed to go anywhere

6
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.633
Stay here for me

7
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.100
Why should I?

8
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.566
Are you worried that I'm going to ruin your marriage?

9
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.633
Don't worry.

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.166
Who do you want to marry?

11
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.100
I couldn't care less.

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.500
If you dare to take half a step out of here

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.766
You will never see Dabao again

14
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200
President, are you really going to do this today?

15
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.500
No one can marry me

16
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.300
Hey son

17
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.166
Ah, it's gone.

18
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.766
What should I do?

19
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.733
What? How?

20
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.200
I don't know.

21
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.800
He said he was going out

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.166
What did you say that Erbao is not dead, he is still alive?

23
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.300
Said he was taken by the bad guys and he was going to save him

24
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.300
He ran out of the dragon

25
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.366
Do something!

26
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:41.533
Mom, don't worry.

27
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.366
I'll come right away

28
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:54.866
Who are you?

29
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.166
What are you trying to do?

30
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.900
Take me to this place

31
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.900
Where's my baby?

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.033
Where's my baby?

33
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.200
You walk into the world

34
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.466
You can see your child

35
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.133
Erbao

36
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.000
Why is Erbao crying?
