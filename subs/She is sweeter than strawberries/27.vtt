00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.300
As the saying goes!

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.933
I want to capture a man's heart

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.500
It's about to grab a man's stomach

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.866
If the young master likes your cooking

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.700
Then I can't live without you

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.133
Master, come and eat

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.200
This is what Miss Qiao made on purpose

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.966
I learned it especially for you

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.066
Misunderstood him

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.933
No, please don't get me wrong.

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.166
I'll just learn

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.666
It's none of your business.

13
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.433
This kid is shy

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:27.966
Cut the crap

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.033
Let's sit down

16
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.600
Ahahahaha

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.666
Unexpectedly, I asked Sister Liu about my word-of-mouth.

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.033
Eat buckets but not ginger

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.066
Won't be cruel

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.833
I forgot to put the ginger in it.

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.800
Master, don't leave today

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.666
Stay with the lady and the children

23
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:53.900
The pregnant woman?

24
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.733
After a three-month dangerous period

25
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.100
You can live a married life properly

26
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:02.000
This helps to regulate the endocrine of pregnant women

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.900
Husband and wife life

28
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.433
What lie did Sister Liu say?

29
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.600
I'm finished.

30
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.633
I'm the only one

31
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.100
How are you doing at the company recently?

32
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.833
I heard that there is a new Tiantian in your design department.

33
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.566
He's not a low-key person, is he?

34
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.066
The workplace is like a battlefield

35
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.266
Don't worry.

36
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.300
What about me?

37
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.266
Strong is strong

38
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.166
Won't treat me so easily

39
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
As expected of my favorite

40
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.333
Keep us out of contact with other men

41
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:40.300
But he secretly brought the little white moonlight out on a date

42
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.700
Really double standard

43
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.800
I didn't expect Ah Zhi and Tingting

44
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.800
Do you want to say hello

45
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:51.166
Okay, Manager Rong

46
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:53.100
Coincidentally, you are also here.
