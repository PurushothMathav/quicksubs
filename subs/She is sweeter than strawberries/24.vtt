1
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.400
The president is so vicissitudes

2
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.200
Is it because of me?

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.400
Why do you keep looking at you?

4
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.700
I've never seen anything like you

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.433
Don't think about it.

6
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:19.966
It's not you who's worried

7
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.400
It's the baby in the belly

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.600
I see.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.600
How can I explain this to you?

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.833
Tomorrow we go back home

11
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.333
Ozawa

12
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.800
The doctor has grown up

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.066
Sorry, the president has not yet.

14
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.500
But I've got a few ideas.

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.266
Three months ago.

16
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.600
The doctor who operated on his wife was in a car accident

17
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.933
He was placed in a nursing home.

18
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.833
Ask the punishment card people to find them one by one

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.900
I'll give you another week.

20
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.066
20 is fine

21
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:52.566
Hey Joe

22
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.900
Love you this time

23
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.966
The work at the Treasure of Pregnancy exhibition is very different

24
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.700
The lottery company received 50 million orders that day

25
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.000
I think the position of this summary is none other than you

26
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.366
Don't forget me in the future

27
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.866
Oops, I also work for the director

28
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.233
It will depend on his arrangement then.

29
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.866
I haven't congratulated you on your promotion and raise yet

30
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.933
What do I have to celebrate?

31
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.533
Hey

32
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:18.100
I heard that the company has a new manager named Tiantian today

33
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.033
It's for Tiananmen Square

34
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.500
I heard that he has a good relationship with the president

35
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.566
Likely to become the former director

36
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.000
You are Joanne

37
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:38.766
You are
