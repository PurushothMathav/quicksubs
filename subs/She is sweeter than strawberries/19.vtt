00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.333
Why is he still here?

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.633
You're not asking me to go out and spy on me, are you?

3
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.500
Is it gone forever from now on?

4
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.700
President, are you still there?

5
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.533
You are welcome to eat before leaving.

6
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.333
Ah.

7
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.600
I am in my own home

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.966
I also need you to welcome me.

9
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.566
Master, prenatal education is popular now

10
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:02.066
You will come more often to accompany Miss Qiao and the children in the future

11
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.200
Do more prenatal education

12
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.200
Don't move

13
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.366
Don't come if you can

14
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.733
Hidden suspicion

15
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.466
While making Mrs. Liu an apprentice

16
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.600
If you talk too much

17
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.200
Well, of course potatoes are delicious?

18
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.100
No, it hasn't been delivered yet. Hmm.

19
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.300
It tastes better than you can imagine.

20
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.900
Going to Luo Wutong next month

21
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.633
Can you eat it every day?

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.900
These are all jewelry designed by myself.

23
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.033
You can take a look.

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.700
It seems that Joanne's commercial is very popular.

25
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.633
He's really good, right?

26
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:54.966
Just ordinary people

27
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.233
Yeah.

28
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.200
You have euphemisms

29
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.600
If you fall in love with another woman

30
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.100
It will definitely set off a big wave in the Rong family

31
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.633
It seems that I am still lucky

32
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.866
Anyone who likes it can pursue it boldly

33
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.700
Pursue this kind of woman

34
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.900
Just saluting the Rong family

35
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.100
You are the blind man of the Rong family

36
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.800
As long as you don't object

37
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.766
Who would be ashamed?

38
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.166
second brother

39
00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.533
Why did you help Joanne make such a good promo video?

40
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:29.400
I don't really want him to be my second sister-in-law, do I?

41
00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:33.266
I am pursuing him.

42
00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:34.366
I did it.

43
00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:36.000
He is your son.

44
00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:43.200
Dragon brother, I think

45
00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:45.066
The second brother just wants to play with him

46
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500
What do you think?

47
00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:47.700
Nothing to do with me

48
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.000
Gates is now this woman going back to the hotel
