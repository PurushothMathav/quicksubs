00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.033
Rongzhi, I admit that this time it was a euphemism that was wrong

2
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.466
I also recognize that you broke off the engagement with him

3
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.200
But you shouldn't have sent him abroad.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.200
And you shouldn't have just broken the engagement

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.466
Bring this woman into the house

6
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.300
Is that so?

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.066
I brought Tiantian back today.

8
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.366
Just to announce something

9
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.166
get married

10
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.833
I have discussed it with grandpa.

11
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.100
The wedding will be held after the Spring Festival

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.633
Why didn't you tell me the purpose?

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.700
purpose

14
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.466
Why are you so eager to take the day before yesterday?

15
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.366
Marry into the door

16
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.033
Are you going to hack dinner and me to death?

17
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.566
Ah, and the family rules of Rong marriage

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.866
Should be the first filial piety three daughters

19
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.000
Can't get married

20
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.566
If you get pregnant every day

21
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.200
Maybe.

22
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:55.866
end

23
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.800
When did you recover?

24
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.800
Maybe it's because Tiantian came back and I'm in a good mood.

25
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.466
So the body recovers faster?

26
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.433
You should let me quit gradually

27
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.333
And I'm going abroad 10,000 times

28
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.866
Why don't you let me see

29
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
Don't worry.

30
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.733
I will arrange for the food, clothing, housing and transportation of the late resignation

31
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:19.400
Potato, I think it's good for him not to let him see you

32
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.333
Humph

33
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.833
If the euphemism can't be someone else's business

34
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.000
Others rest

35
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.400
The girl who does artificial archery is him

36
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.700
Yes, that's him. That's him.

37
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.500
This girl is beautiful

38
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.166
You can recognize it at a glance

39
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.000
So many girls, why is it him?

40
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.566
Do you know

41
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.100
You ruined an innocent and good girl

42
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:57.000
He's the only virgin in the ability side of the inspection

43
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.933
And the girl who originally had the surgery

44
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.500
Suddenly disappeared

45
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.966
I think he's rather dehydrated

46
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.000
He has been desperately raising money to treat his brother's illness

47
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.500
I was thinking.

48
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.800
If the surgery is successful

49
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.766
He's sure to get a lot of money

50
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.066
This thing

51
00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:24.100
Can't tell anyone

52
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:25.666
Especially me

53
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.366
I only dare to say this half word

54
00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.600
I will definitely make you disappear from this world

55
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.566
Why is it Joanne?

56
00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:44.666
from now on

57
00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.800
I will definitely give you Jon

58
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.700
No one can take it away
