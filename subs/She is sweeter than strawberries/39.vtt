00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.400
When sweet is still alive

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.366
The two sisters don't have a good relationship

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.500
And now he's dead.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.433
Sweet enough to pretend to be sisters

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.166
It was clearly played for Brother Rong

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.566
Call me so hard

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.266
I thought you were very capable

8
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.900
Who made you fall?

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.566
Promise I won't tell you

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.166
Hmm

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:29.666
Miss, stop drinking, you've already drunk a lot

12
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.466
Xiao An

13
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.766
Are you saying I'm unlucky?

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.200
If the artificial birthday girl was successful at that time

15
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.300
Brother Rong wouldn't dare not marry me

16
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.266
The result is still in your stomach

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200
Xiao An, why is your belly so big?

18
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.466
It's all for the after-effects of abortion

19
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.300
Uterine fibroids

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.866
It's all your fault

21
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:05.666
Immediately after he resigned, he went abroad without a trace

22
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.200
Must be intentional

23
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.500
Inside

24
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.633
There has to be some conspiracy

25
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.633
You mean?

26
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.466
Someone deliberately kept you from getting pregnant with Mr. Rong's child

27
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.366
Wrong object on purpose

28
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.166
Is it faking medical malpractice?

29
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.366
You know

30
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:26.166
Why do the Rong family think that dragon blood is a gentleman?

31
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.566
Just because three years ago

32
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.400
Brother Rong was assassinated at sea

33
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.900
Although he saved his life

34
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.833
But the toxicity spreads to the reproductive system

35
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.700
He's toxic.

36
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.466
Didn't happen to produce a healthy child. Wow.

37
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.133
I wouldn't let anyone know that I was pregnant with his child

38
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.033
Then my own children

39
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.600
You see my only home

40
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.500
What do you underestimate?
