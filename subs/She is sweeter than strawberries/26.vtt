00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.133
Mr. Rong, aren't you on a business trip?

2
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.200
Why are you back?

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.966
8 means can't wait

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.900
Why did you see the little white moonlight and hear it on your shoulders?

5
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.933
You deliberately arranged the paratroopers

6
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.566
Are you giving me a slap in the face?

7
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.533
Or did you promise to give it to me?

8
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.800
Director's campaign parties are all lies

9
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.633
You lose on the first day. That's your strength.

10
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.266
I'm not worried at all if it's fair play

11
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm afraid some people will stumble behind the scenes

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.066
Relationships always take me away

13
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.000
Nonsense

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.933
To say who is better than you

15
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.366
Everyone in the company knows he's your contact

16
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.566
They don't call us beautiful women like we do

17
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.766
People are a song of tolerance

18
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.033
A song of tolerance on the right

19
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.566
For fear that others will not know about your ambiguous relationship

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.400
Hi.

21
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.500
It turns out that you are angry because of this

22
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.633
Of course not.

23
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.366
I am afraid

24
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.166
Your company is carried away by emotions

25
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.833
You are jealous

26
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.833
No no you must not misunderstand

27
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.700
I have absolutely no serious thoughts about you

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.533
Even if you're hugging a woman right now

29
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.966
I'll just give you a round of applause from the side.

30
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.200
What nonsense are you talking about?

31
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.366
Mr. Rong

32
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.866
Although I am pregnant with your child now

33
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.800
But we will always get divorced

34
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:33.166
I also want to find someone who goes both ways to get married

35
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.833
Go both ways

36
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.466
You wouldn't be naive to think

37
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.500
Nominally my wife

38
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.866
You can still be my sister-in-law

39
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.500
Unless he Rong Xiuyuan doesn't want to describe me anymore

40
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.166
inexplicable

41
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.600
Jon

42
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.366
I'm back home and I'm waiting to eat your own meal

43
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:01.066
By the end of this week.

44
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.833
I must learn four dishes and one soup
