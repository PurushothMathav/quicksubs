00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.466
OK

2
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.000
Mom smells so good

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.033
Are you going to see Qiao Ran on the set today?

4
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.300
Yes, the hotel over there has contacted him.

5
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.333
I'm not worried about you either.

6
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.300
Whether it's Mulin or Yunko?

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.900
They are both dragons and phoenixes among people

8
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.033
I'm happy whoever you marry.

9
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.466
Mom

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.033
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.233
Dragon is always the big boss

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.833
I can't get into a fight with him

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.533
Your mother me

14
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.800
Fiery Eyes

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.833
He definitely means that to you

16
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.600
But I think so

17
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.466
Or is the purpose more suitable for you?

18
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.166
Mom mom

19
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.066
Why is your belly so big?

20
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.233
Like late pregnancy

21
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.500
Let me see first

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.300
Mom what late pregnancy

23
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.666
I grew up with uterine fibroids.

24
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.366
If you don't believe me, we'll go to the hospital for a checkup later

25
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.100
Hey, I'll accompany you to the hospital for a review after the medicine is finished.

26
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.166
I was continuing to grow.

27
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.800
Hurry up and go to my brother

28
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.066
Mom

29
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.766
I said if

30
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.966
If I had kids, got married and got divorced

31
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.800
Will you blame me?

32
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.033
What's the matter, you're blind

33
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.300
Go this scumbag

34
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:37.733
OK

35
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.366
Why does it feel like someone is so popular?

36
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.600
Oh, my dear, Jin-sun.

37
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.266
She will be born in a few months, hahahaha.

38
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.766
After the baby is born, it must continue to be kept confidential

39
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.966
Wait and be terrified

40
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.366
As for Joanne

41
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.866
Arrangements after divorce

42
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:05.766
There are no jokes, haha, okay.

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.066
I will arrange for the order to be taken off, grandpa, don't worry.

44
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.233
What are you going to do with Wanmai City?

45
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.466
Hey, it depends on what the whole family thinks.

46
00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:19.700
This witness and physical evidence are already available.

47
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.966
Last time I ran

48
00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.366
Your apprehension about the Tian family

49
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:25.466
Don't be too obvious.

50
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:28.166
It's been three years, don't you?

51
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:30.400
I haven't let go of the sweetness yet

52
00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.800
I have my own pony.

53
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.166
Don't worry, hahahaha.

54
00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:38.566
In fact, I quite like this kid too

55
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.100
It's a pity that his life is thin

56
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:43.500
Deep in love with you

57
00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:47.833
You still have to try to put him down and accept new people

58
00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:50.000
Even newcomers

59
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.266
You must not give birth to a son

60
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.200
To be honest, what about the late word?

61
00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:59.800
It is the granddaughter-in-law designated for grandma

62
00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:03.366
He's a bit hateful except for his temper

63
00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:08.200
To you, but wholeheartedly, hahahaha

64
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:12.966
But sweet sister is a schemer

65
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.566
It is absolutely impossible for people to accept him

66
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.800
What if it was Joanne?

67
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.466
You will accept him
