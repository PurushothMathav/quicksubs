00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.866
Brother Rong, let alone three years

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.033
Even three months, I don't want to wait anymore.

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.600
You are now the home of the Rong family

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.233
Mainly not to change the rules

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.466
Rules are rules

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.300
If future generations can change it at will

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.566
What else? Why?

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.033
Do you want me, a member of the Rong family, to come down? Why?

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.533
Ah Zhi, euphemisms are just casual remarks

10
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.866
I see, although you didn't prove it

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.766
But ah, already engaged

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.500
It's like a couple

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.633
Why don't you let Wan Qi live in your house?

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.733
Aunt, it's not that you don't know

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.266
Before I couldn't see it at all

16
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.500
I can't tell you.

17
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.300
But don't worry, aunt.

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.366
My fiancee is the only one who thinks about it.

19
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.266
There will never be a second one.

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.166
Joe loves you don't worry

21
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.466
This is you as the official designer

22
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.800
Exhibiting in Paris for the first time

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.366
I will definitely help you take the best pictures.

24
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.700
Thank you, you're welcome.

25
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.700
In fact, I have been looking for you since I returned to China

26
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.166
Yes, looking for me.

27
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.200
After that trip

28
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.700
My dad's condition suddenly worsened

29
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.333
I accompanied him to a foreign country for treatment

30
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.600
I have been trying to get in touch since returning home

31
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.233
But your phone keeps turning off

32
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.166
Ah!

33
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:24.433
That's because after I graduated, I

34
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.400
Just go through work

35
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.033
Changed the phone number

36
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.433
I see.

37
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.833
Fortunately, we finally meet again.

38
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.666
I will never let you go again this time
