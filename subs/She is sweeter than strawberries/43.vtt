1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.400
Who is the murderer?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.266
This is not something you should know

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.966
Oh then I won't ask

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Give up on me. The baby in my belly is yours

5
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.566
If something happens to you

6
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.766
What will happen to my child?

7
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:33.233
I'm still counting on him to inherit your estate

8
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:34.766
exist

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.633
You lift me again

10
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm a little sleepy. I'll go back first.

11
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.166
The president told his waiter that it was a gift

12
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.733
He said it was Shen Wanz

13
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.666
Miss Shen's significant hand

14
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:50.900
Shen Wanci didn't dare

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.700
Joker Xue

16
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.800
Ryuko, you were in front of so many people that day

17
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.666
Publicly take Tiantian away and leave

18
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.700
If you don't give us an explanation today

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm out of it.

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.433
This mess is not someone else

21
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.400
Is a wearing

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.633
The lady in the red collar dress asked me to do this

23
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.800
He wears sunglasses

24
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.466
I can't see his face.

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100
All I know is that there is a row of diamonds on his skirt

26
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.433
He gave me 200,000

27
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:23.933
I was also obsessed with money and agreed. This is a witch fairy

28
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.566
This man has nothing to do with me

29
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.433
It's not something you always do.

30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.066
Although our Wanci is usually naughty

31
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.133
But I can say for sure about this.

32
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.800
Absolutely nothing to do with euphemisms

33
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.733
Our euphemism

34
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:35.966
absolutely

35
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.566
Yeah, I wouldn't commit such a low-level in such a big scene

36
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.166
mistake

37
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.833
Someone must be forcing

38
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.400
and

39
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.833
We're not the only ones who hate sweetie.

40
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.066
It must be Joanne

41
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.966
Joanne and Tiantian are in the company

42
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.766
Compete for the director position

43
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.466
Tiantian always relies on her relationship with you

44
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.400
Suppress him everywhere

45
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.200
He must be holding a grudge

46
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200
So I bribed the waiter to burn him

47
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.800
Then I'm afraid you'll blame him

48
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:00.966
Just frame me and let me take the blame

49
00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:02.200
As far as I know

50
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.900
You're worth at least 200,000 because of his dress

51
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:09.033
All the savings of one of his small employees added up

52
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:10.566
He can spin for a while

53
00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.000
I remember that day when I left the province

54
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.833
Joanne just got up

55
00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:17.300
It's not a coincidence.

56
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.800
Don't leave early, don't leave late

57
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.166
But at that time

58
00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:21.700
People should be glad they can't get away

59
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.266
It's better to get hurt

60
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:29.066
Brother Ma Long doesn't believe me at all

61
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.666
What should I do? Don't worry.

62
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:32.166
You must

63
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.100
Will definitely pay

64
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.666
I satisfy your innocence

65
00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.066
I don't want you to turn back

66
00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.366
You are the grievance now
