00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.833
Do I want to have this child or not?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.966
If Rong always knew he wouldn't fire me, right?

3
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.066
Come with me after 7 o'clock and ask for the big brother of the people

4
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.066
You listen to me.

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.500
My lips can't even open the pot

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.066
My picture is still you move first

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.400
You, you, just let me go

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.300
Let's chase after the fairy wind

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.433
I didn't expect you to know what's good or bad

10
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.433
I dealt with you.

11
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.333
Uncle Zhang, Miss Qiao

12
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.366
Please come with me

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.566
The really big boss will not steal money except

14
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.600
It doesn't seem much safer than the gangsters

15
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.900
Mr. Rong

16
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.200
Can I help you?

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.800
You are pregnant with my son

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.866
Like I said last time, it's the infirmary

19
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.500
Medical room

20
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.466
Are you sure it's not the doctor you bought the house from?

21
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.600
After all, you were licking unsupported at the hospital gate that day

22
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.400
money

23
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.166
Go ahead.

24
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.266
How much do you want?

25
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.700
Less narcissistic

26
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.466
I don't want your money.

27
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.866
If you hadn't released the handle last time

28
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.466
How did I receive it?

29
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.266
No money

30
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.366
That is.

31
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.400
Seduce me first, right?

32
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:01.766
I'll take the ball to the stage

33
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.900
Yes

34
00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.600
What is that?

35
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.200
I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow morning

36
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:10.000
How miserable
