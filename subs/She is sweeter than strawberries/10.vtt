00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.933
By the way, Molly, this is Rongshi's new product launch event.

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.600
Why are you here?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:08.033
I can't think of the second young master of Tang Sengrong's family

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.200
I actually know the small employees of our company

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.500
Ah Zi, we haven't seen each other for three years

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.833
So malicious to me

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.466
After all, what I hate the most is illegitimate children

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.066
Just like the blind man

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.866
Dirty shit

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.400
It seems that my brother doesn't welcome me very much today.

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.566
Xiao An

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.100
It's good to see you again.

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.233
Have time to eat together

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.800
OK

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.466
Are you familiar with Tenderness Xuan?

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.866
I met Mo Li three years ago in the travel room

17
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.366
Mr. Dragon, I swear

18
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.833
I really don't know which one he is.

19
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.266
Remember who you are now

20
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.166
Stay away from him

21
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.033
Hello, Mom?

22
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.400
Your brother is suffering from medical side effects

23
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.966
Now the liver is injured

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.100
Can you?

25
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.633
Transfer 100,000 dollars to me

26
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.300
Mom, don't cry

27
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.200
I'll transfer the money now.

28
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.833
Now ask him to marry him

29
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.366
I hope this 100,000 works

30
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.033
But when will this 300,000 run out?

31
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.633
Miss Joe took another 100,000 from Cary

32
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.066
Mrs. Liu said that she doesn't usually go shopping or spend money indiscriminately

33
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.100
Hey, where do you think she spent 300,000?

34
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.500
She won't secretly save it to her card.

35
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.866
It's a small thing.

36
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.833
As long as he is safe

37
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.300
I wouldn't mind giving him more

38
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.800
Ah, by the way, the second sister-in-law of the president is here.

39
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.866
Naming Sister Jojo

40
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.866
Wish him the best in jewelry designer

41
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:57.933
Hey

42
00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:01.300
It turns out that the haute couture department appointed me to design a diamond necklace

43
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.433
Is the big customer you?

44
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.900
It's a gift for my girlfriend.

45
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.900
You misunderstood.

46
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.666
This is for my aunt.

47
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.700
It's his birthday next month

48
00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.900
My mother died early

49
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:16.366
I said my uncle was scared

50
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.166
However, the position of girlfriend

51
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.700
I don't know if anyone is dealing with you

52
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200
At the Rong family

53
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.666
Bastard children will be forced to go abroad

54
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.766
Brother Rong's half-brother Rong Xiuyuan

55
00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.333
It's illegitimate

56
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:37.233
The day his mother gave birth to him

57
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.000
I want to ask how your mother passed away

58
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800
I am the illegitimate child of the Rong family

59
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.800
You buried you

60
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
My bag is sent abroad.

61
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.366
I heard that when he gave birth to me

62
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.866
Accidents write everywhere in the world

63
00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:59.466
Was it really an accident?

64
00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:00.500
What's your trouble?

65
00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:01.866
We don't look very good.

66
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.933
I'm fine, don't be too sad.

67
00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:07.833
You must have a wife and children in the future

68
00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:10.100
They are your most important people

69
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.466
It's not easy to meet someone who is truly in love

70
00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:14.766
Joanne

71
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.833
Have you ever met someone you really like?

72
00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.400
I have encountered

73
00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.866
In Hoh Xil

74
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.800
But we can't have love

75
00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:27.400
In fact, I am interested in you
