00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.066
Mr. Rong

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.466
Miss Shen came to see me today

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.533
Recent company

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.400
Rumors are everywhere about me killing Tiantian

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.600
You have to help me decide!

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.466
How can you prove that you were framed?

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.566
I think their goals are not just sweet

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.266
And I'm lucky I go fast

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.866
Otherwise, the baby in the belly will definitely be hurt.

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.666
That's because you knew in advance

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.466
That's why I left early

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.166
If I cooperate with Miss Shen

13
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.900
Then why impersonate him to plead guilty?

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.966
If this is what Miss Shen did

15
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.266
He is the one who contributes the money

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.066
Do you still need to cooperate with me?

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Forever why did you encounter sweet things

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.466
Your brain has deteriorated

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.700
I'm angry.

20
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.566
Okay, I said that on purpose to test you

21
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.866
What about this?

22
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.733
You don't have to worry.

23
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.400
I'm already afraid that the people below will check it out.

24
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.300
As for the company rumors?

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.033
Don't worry, okay?

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.066
You said the rumor-monger

27
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.133
Could it be the beginning of mediocrity?

28
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:07.500
Nope.

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.900
I said you don't need to worry about this.

30
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.466
But until this matter is investigated clearly

31
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.266
Just be honest, okay?

32
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.800
Who is calling

33
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.900
Take it

34
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.100
Sister Canran

35
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.833
What's the matter, sister?

36
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.166
I was just with some classmates

37
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.466
Eat near your house

38
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.966
Just stopped by to see you

39
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.600
I'm downstairs of your house now.

40
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.966
Hurry up and open the door for me
