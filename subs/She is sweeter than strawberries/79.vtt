00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.133
All these accidents

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.600
Could be a big conspiracy

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.300
And the population at that time was angry

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.500
Maybe it's nothing.

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.866
What do you mean?

6
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.266
The doctor did it.

7
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.300
The doctor who operated on you

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.200
My name is Liu Hui

9
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.433
The day after surgery, he called the hospital to resign

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.000
Haven't found it yet

11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.300
And I've been looking for him

12
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.466
But still no impression

13
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.166
If it's a conspiracy

14
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.966
Is it the same as Shen Wanci?

15
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.600
I thought the child was left behind

16
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.900
When he learns the truth about the child

17
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.566
He let someone hit me

18
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.366
Let me stay

19
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.600
So until everything is investigated

20
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.500
You'd better take it at home

21
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.833
It will be more reassuring

22
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300
The president's bodyguard was negligent for a while

23
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.733
The shadow doctor who delivered the wife ran away

24
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.400
They found him dead.

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.500
What's the use of you?

26
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.433
Liu Fang recently

27
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.200
Rarely go out

28
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.700
But I went home today

29
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.033
Top me

30
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.033
Sister Qiao Qiao is recovering well

31
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.200
You can move around as usual.

32
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.433
Director Chen

33
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.500
Is Dr. Wang Jie, who delivered my baby, here today?

34
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.100
Wang Jie

35
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.833
He passed away some time ago.

36
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.266
Quite sudden

37
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.433
Why did he die?

38
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.966
Sister Wang, everything is fine.

39
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.866
Just a little bit wrong

40
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.700
Love to gamble and listen to colleagues

41
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.833
He was watching football at the bar that night

42
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.400
He was just so excited.

43
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.966
I had a heart attack.

44
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.200
All the accidents this time

45
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.166
There may be a big cause and effect behind him

46
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.900
Ok, thank you Mr. Chen.
