00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.366
Well, I have been a monk for so many years

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.866
Do you have the idea of falling in love?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.466
My brother

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.666
What do you care about?

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.833
The big boss will definitely punish me when he hears it. I don't want to

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.766
I just want to be a director now

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.066
Men are a burden

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.366
It will only affect the speed at which I make money.

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.100
Did my sister kiss the boss?

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.700
Just to become director

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.100
Men are all

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.566
I'll use the ATM.

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.433
I'm not afraid at all every time I ask for money

14
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.133
Sister, what about Murrig?

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.100
You see he is handsome and excellent

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.966
What's so great about it?

17
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.433
Fall in love with him

18
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.466
I've told you a hundred times.

19
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.600
I'm just friends with Murrig

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.600
Now is and will be

21
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.966
What about your boss?

22
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.900
Although he is a sea king

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.733
That's rich and powerful

24
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.000
And he's handsome.

25
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.766
You don't want to be in a relationship with him either

26
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.600
I know he's my boss

27
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.433
How dare you ask such a ridiculous question

28
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.533
Hey, I refuse in front of the office.

29
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.766
Why do you keep asking about adults?

30
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.466
It's getting late

31
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.766
Go back and rest

32
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.633
Sister, I just arrived.

33
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.800
Don't come, sister, let's go

34
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.633
Ah, luckily the big boss didn't hear anything

35
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.866
Which eye did you see that I won't fall in love with you?

36
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.400
I didn't mean that, you misunderstood.

37
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.633
I mean there is absolutely no way you can like me

38
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.566
Even if the sun rises in the west

39
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.366
The sow will climb the tree

40
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.800
I am the only woman left in the world

41
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.400
You will never fall in love with me

42
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.066
People like you who eat ingredients like life

43
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.066
You don't deserve to be my woman

44
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.800
Also, if you fall in love in the future

45
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.033
You shouldn't have time to come to me, right?

46
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.633
You especially don't want me to love you.

47
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:56.266
I didn't mean that.

48
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.466
I mean if you feel bad in the future
