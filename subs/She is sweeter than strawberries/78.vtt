1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.633
I do hate you

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.866
I hate that you and Lu Xueyan are entangled

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.333
i

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.533
I hate that you can affect my mood at every turn

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.900
I hate it when you talk about it every day

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.066
Primary two

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.433
You really don't know anything

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.400
What he meant

9
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.866
Is that what I think it means?

10
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.866
What are your hands doing?

11
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.666
Please take care of yourself. What's wrong?

12
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.000
When you are by my side

13
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.466
I don't want to eat your father for you

14
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.766
You are not

15
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.966
The most taboo thing for men to say is no

16
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.100
Why don't I try it first?

17
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.166
I have something to tell you.

18
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.466
I plan to work from home from tomorrow

19
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.300
I'll be back at the company in two weeks

20
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.666
You are a good employee.

21
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.866
But you are not a good wife and mother

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.366
Can a good wife and mother be paid?

23
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.566
economic independence

24
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.166
It's the beginning of a woman's respect

25
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.866
And I'm a career woman

26
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.433
I can forget my worries while working

27
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.200
Every time I dream of another baby

28
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.800
I hate myself so much

29
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:43.466
Ah!

30
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.433
It's not your fault.

31
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.200
Can you work from home?

32
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.000
But it must be after maternity leave.

33
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.900
To go to work

34
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:56.033
Me? Why?

35
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:58.533
I don't have to breastfeed

36
00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.366
Just when I'm not around

37
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:01.866
Mom and Mrs. Liu can both take care of the children

38
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.433
I can totally go to work

39
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.366
This is the driver, Mr. Xu

40
00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:08.166
Haven't found it yet

41
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.200
What do you mean?

42
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.433
Wasn't that an accident?

43
00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.300
Someone wants to harm the child
