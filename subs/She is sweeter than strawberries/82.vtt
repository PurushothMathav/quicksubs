00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.000
What is rare?

2
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.966
It is rare that a man has to keep his body like a jade

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.766
Keep clean for your wife

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.166
You are not allowed to hook up with other men and women

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.100
When you meet a fox spirit, you have to sit still

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.466
Never be afraid of Lei

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.233
Can't blame Lei for being late

8
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:25.766
how

9
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.600
You're starting to show off your wealth

10
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.900
How can I have this ability?

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.900
Anyway, for me, husband and wife must be equal.

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.233
Otherwise, one shot and two shots will be scattered

13
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.700
Shoot away

14
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.700
Demand equality from me

15
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.900
Are you qualified?

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.400
OK

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.500
I don't have it.

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.566
So don't say that misleading thing.

19
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.566
We're going to get divorced sooner or later anyway

20
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.300
You can try it back.

21
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.800
scum scum

22
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.200
It must be controlled by fat dissolution.

23
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.033
Will not reply to my message

24
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.466
Do you know why you lost to him in the first place?

25
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.433
Because your heart is too soft

26
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.966
Not tough enough

27
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.500
If not for you

28
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.433
How could I lose my toughness?

29
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.400
Maybe it's fate

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.033
You and Rongzhi have to fight again

31
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.966
I'll help you.

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.500
No, nothing else.

33
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800
You'd better stay out of this

34
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:43.733
aunt

35
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.300
You'd better stop going behind my back

36
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.333
Do anything to hurt Jon

37
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.766
Or I'll go back to America

38
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.600
Never come back

39
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.800
Something that's hard to achieve
