00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.266
Second Young Master Qiao An

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.933
Why are you two together?

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.566
You're not really what the rumors say.

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.233
Are you secretly in love?

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.366
Manager Tian, are you kidding me?

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.700
Molly and I are good friends

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.100
Joanne was my best friend.

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.800
Confidant friends are more important than girlfriends

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.433
If you say so

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.600
I'm afraid there are already too many confidants of the big brother.

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.500
This damn woman meets the dragon brother again

12
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.366
Thousands of dollars are easy to get

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.700
Confidant kindness

14
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.133
Girlfriends can have many

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.600
But confidants don't matter.

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.300
Really?

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:40.000
Then I also want to be the only confidant of the Dragon Pavilion

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.800
Then you go for it.

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.966
You talk slowly

20
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.200
Let's go first

21
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.600
What is Mr. Feng doing?

22
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.900
This is the women's room

23
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.866
Your relationship with Rong Xiuyuan has really improved by leaps and bounds

24
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.066
Did you still use ordinary netizens before?

25
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.166
Become a confidant now

26
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.800
You are not the same as Tiantian, you are a confidante

27
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800
Why are only state officials allowed to set fires?

28
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.100
People are not allowed to nod

29
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.833
Whether our company is public or not

30
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:37.100
You are my wife now

31
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.233
If you dare to be a teacher

32
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.466
You're dead.

33
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.300
Certainly.

34
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:49.966
You can also ask me.

35
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:53.233
As long as you have the ability

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.400
Do what you like

37
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.600
We're getting divorced in five months anyway

38
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.100
Then you take your Yangguan Road

39
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.833
I walk my single-plank bridge

40
00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.566
Rules are rules

41
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.433
Before the divorce

42
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.033
You have to behave

43
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.566
I can't even think of other men

44
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:15.666
This man is kicked in the brain by a donkey every day, right?

45
00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.266
No matter what his fiancÃ©e cares about every day

46
00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.033
I'll go out first if there's nothing else

47
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.433
So as not to be seen by others
