00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.700
What? What are you talking about?

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.533
Mom

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.900
Brother Mo Li said that the child in my sister's belly is his

4
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.566
Uh, don't worry.

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.233
As long as I'm here

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.366
Don't be afraid of anything

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.300
Even if the sky falls, I will stand for you

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.200
Now that you and Ah have solved the misunderstanding

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.400
So when are you getting married?

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:24.833
aunt

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.800
I've got it all figured out.

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.966
Wait until the child is born

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.733
I took Ann to Malta to get married

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.200
Where can he only get married and not divorce?

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.666
I've already thought about it

16
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.233
My whole life

17
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.900
Can't be without an answer

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.700
I see.

19
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
I would like to stay with you forever

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.366
Promise you

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900
If there is no wrong teacher Ye

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.633
It's enough if no contractor happens

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.566
Maybe we can really be together

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.066
But it's too late now

25
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.766
Great, great.

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.300
Xiaonan walk

27
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.500
Go shopping with my mother

28
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.000
Cook some good dishes

29
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.266
Jasmine

30
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.166
Thank you for ending for me

31
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.666
You shouldn't have carried it for me

32
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.233
This will affect your life

33
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.566
I meant everything I just said.

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.566
If I had said three years ago that I had something to leave

35
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.200
You've been together for a long time

36
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.700
I do this

37
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.466
Do you mind?

38
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.600
I don't mind.

39
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.466
No matter what happens to you

40
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.866
I don't dislike it

41
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.833
As long as you have me in your heart, it's enough

42
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:47.166
Hey

43
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.600
That one?

44
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.900
Will you be my wife?

45
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.233
I am now

46
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.833
I'm a little confused right now

47
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.500
I want to wait until after the child

48
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.666
Consider my responsibilities

49
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:02.900
I will always wait for you.
