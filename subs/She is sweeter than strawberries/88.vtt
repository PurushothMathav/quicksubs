00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.200
I admit that I grew up jealous of looks

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.666
Have the loyalty that I don't have

3
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.833
I thought about that.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.066
Want to take everything from him

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.833
But on us

6
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.266
After all, it's the same blood

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.866
I'm his brother

8
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.866
brother

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.366
The same blood

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.100
brother

11
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.900
Hahahahaha

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.166
Hahahaha

13
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.633
Ha ha.

14
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:41.866
Ah!

15
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.900
Ah!

16
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.966
Ah, that's enough.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.200
drive

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.000
drive

19
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.566
child

20
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.700
Ah, what about the child?

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.100
The child is safe.

22
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.566
safety

23
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.000
full

24
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.766
After going through so much, I found

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200
My world can't live without you

26
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:28.866
That's impossible.

27
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.600
You're going to dawn

28
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.400
That's a lie.

29
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.900
It's all about luring people out

30
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.433
How could I possibly

31
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.366
I don't want you to marry someone else.

32
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.100
good

33
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.866
I Love You

34
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.333
Happy day for the two of you

35
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.066
Don't put a smile on this face

36
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.766
How can there be such a heartless woman?

37
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.566
Whether our company is public or not

38
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.800
You are my wife now

39
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.166
Find me directly if you have anything in the future

40
00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.300
You are not allowed to shoot the ball.

41
00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:26.800
Joel

42
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:29.966
You really don't know anything

43
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.466
Let's go home.

44
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.466
i

45
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.066
I seem to be in love with you too
