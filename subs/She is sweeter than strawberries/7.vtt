00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.100
Isn't your child already aborted?

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.200
Why are you still retching?

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.000
I've been having a stomach upset recently.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.266
I always retch and nausea after taking stomach medicine

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.166
Again

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.866
How could Mr. Long let me have his child?

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.000
It has to be you too.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.766
After all, you are Mr. Long's fiancee

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.300
I know.

10
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.233
If you let him know

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.000
Not only is the child not aborted

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.200
I also married the CEO

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.666
This crazy woman is probably going crazy

14
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.266
Anna, what do you want to eat tonight?

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.566
Go shopping. Okay.

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.800
No problem uh

17
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.600
Miss Shen, I'm sorry to leave a little early

18
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:46.600
Where did you hear the voice on the phone just now?

19
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.100
Mrs. Liu

20
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.700
Look, why are you with Mrs. Liu?

21
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.266
It's really a narrow road for enemies

22
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.066
Miss Shen, do you know my cousin too?

23
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.833
I just had surgery

24
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.866
I asked my cousin to come and take care of me

25
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.800
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.800
I have to take care of him

27
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.100
So Ann's arrangement will recover so well.

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.700
Mrs. Liu is our nanny

29
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.700
Better not to borrow this maintenance worker

30
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.100
Otherwise I won't let you go

31
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.166
I know my place.

32
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.866
I'm not interested in the CEO

33
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.366
We'll go first

34
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.566
You go first

35
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.266
Good thing you kept the baby

36
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:36.033
Otherwise, you will die the day your child is born.

37
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.200
What do you mean?

38
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.100
At the Rong family

39
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.866
Bastard children will be forced to go abroad

40
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:48.733
Brother Rong's half-brother Long Xiuyuan

41
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.333
It's illegitimate

42
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:54.833
His mother died the day she gave birth to him

43
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:02.000
If you dare to keep the child secretly

44
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.366
Just waiting to be pressed out of the country

45
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.000
Carve somewhere else
