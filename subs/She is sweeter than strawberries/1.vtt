00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.700
President, the sperm you deposit in the sperm bank

2
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.833
It was taken away by provincial insurance for artificial insemination

3
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.800
What? I'm pregnant with artificial insemination?

4
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.600
Doctor, I don't even have a boyfriend

5
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.133
How could you be pregnant?

6
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.966
Medical records are indeed like this

7
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.633
The doctor who operated on you has left

8
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.966
I'm not sure exactly.

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.600
If you don't want children

10
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.366
I can make an appointment for an abortion

11
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.233
I'll think about it.

12
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.100
All the money goes to my brother's medical expenses

13
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.566
How can there be money for procedural surgery?

14
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.600
Give birth and I'll give you 2 million

15
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.533
He is not our President Rong's fiancee

16
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.566
What word?

17
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.700
What does Miss Dong mean?

18
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:27.400
The sperm in your body should be mine

19
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.566
It was the damn doctor who got the wrong person

20
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.200
I gave you a manual authorization.

21
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.033
His child belongs to the big boss.

22
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.133
I'll think about it.

23
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.466
Reply to me within three days.

24
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.100
If you tell Brother Rong, I will kill you

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.333
This Miss Shen

26
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.700
I wonder if artificial insemination was successful?

27
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.800
But who is the girl across from him?

28
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.166
Song Shenwan resigned from the hospital

29
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:59.033
Arrange for a doctor to examine him

30
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.800
What does the child want?

31
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:07.966
If you have money

32
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.200
My brother's illness will definitely get better faster.

33
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.600
Dong Zong, you know it all
