00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.133
Ah!

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:05.066
Ruzong, isn't this far from me?

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.633
Can I touch you?

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.666
We'll see.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.533
Ah you go away

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.000
You go away you don't touch me you go away

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.800
I have never liked money or women

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.100
Start today.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.400
I will often worship the Lord

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.666
We are husband and wife

11
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.400
You've got to be ready.

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.066
Dr. Liu, who is that girl?

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.466
I can't remember her name

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.933
That girl is pretty.

15
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.166
Still a virgin

16
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.700
Physical condition is good

17
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.466
The chances of success are also very high

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.666
Aunt, come to the nursing home as soon as you get off the plane

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.633
Just for this guy in the hospital bed

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.766
Who is he?

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.566
He's a doctor at Kyoto Women's and Children's Hospital.

22
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.466
My name is Liu Hui. I got news three months ago.

23
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:11.233
Shen Wanci wanted to use lipolytic gold for artificial insemination

24
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.533
So I paid him off.

25
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.033
Want the surgery to fail

26
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.566
Unexpectedly, Shen Wanci did not appear

27
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.600
He put lipolytic seeds

28
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.566
Put it in another woman's stomach

29
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.633
But he hasn't told me who it is yet.

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.900
There was a withdrawal.

31
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.500
He has been in a coma until now.

32
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.233
Fat has been looking for him

33
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.166
Luckily I secretly hid it

34
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.800
I didn't let the paper find it.

35
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.066
What are you doing?

36
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.500
Can you tell me in advance?

37
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.600
I was going to take care of everything

38
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.366
I'll tell you again.

39
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.733
But I didn't expect something to go wrong in the middle

40
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.500
The paper container has probably been discovered

41
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.633
Secretly hid that woman

42
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.466
It's also possible that their plan didn't work out at all

43
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.700
If this woman exists

44
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.233
How could grandpa be so calm?

45
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.566
But we can't let go of the past

46
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.266
You must find this woman first

47
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.800
I heard you've been very close to a woman recently

48
00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:05.200
Xiaoyuan, you have to remember the purpose of your return.

49
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:07.866
aunt

50
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.966
I know what I'm doing.

51
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.700
You can touch anyone but Jon can't
