00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.160
Are you okay? It's okay.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920
We can't avoid being anxious. It'll be fine in a moment.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.070
However, I still care a lot.

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.250
Right? Do you want a sister?

5
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.180
I'll tell you about it in the morning. This little thing,

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.980
You're welcome. Isnâ€™t that necessary?

7
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.900
I've missed you. No.

8
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.360
Don't worry, just choose 30.

9
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.240
Just have a good chat with your friend

10
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.150
He just wants you to be tired

11
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.560
Don't look at your appearance.

12
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.140
Take a look at yourself for a day
