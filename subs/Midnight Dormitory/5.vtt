00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.933
Ah!

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.900
Lord Guo

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.866
Master Guo Douzhu Guo Douzhu

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.066
You don't deserve to talk to me

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.700
Call the blood rose

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.200
Hahahaha

7
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.366
You are so loud

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.200
Dare to call Lord Rose by her first name

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.066
This is the soul

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.866
Hurt my brother like my door

11
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.766
Even the name and soul of Lord Rose dare to slander

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.066
I just don't take you seriously

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.666
You're so arrogant!

14
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.000
Ah!

15
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.700
Guo Douzhu killed him

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.200
Cut him to pieces

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.366
Guo Duzhuo

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.700
My husband came home on impulse when he was about to recoil

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.366
But he was also there to protect me from the bad guys

20
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.166
And?

21
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.266
Qinghe man-made Yanqing

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.433
Do not seek justice

23
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.766
But ask the helmsman to be just

24
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.666
Let go of Lin Fan and our Qiao family

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.366
Qinghe, what nonsense are you talking about?

26
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.066
Lin Fan has nothing to do with our Qiao family

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.266
Lin Fan has long been abolished by our family

28
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.300
Wrong, you understand enough

29
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.900
I understand the situation

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.200
I am the most fair person

31
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.200
frequent

32
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.233
Bite off one of Xu Ziheng's ears

33
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.200
Now you cut off one of your ears.

34
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.100
Apologize for this

35
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.966
Uncle, this is too cheap for him. Well, he is

36
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.566
What's the matter, I need to do it myself?

37
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.400
Helmsman, he spared you once

38
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.000
If he does it himself

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700
You're already suffering

40
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.100
He deserves to cut my ears too

41
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.366
Why are you afraid of pain?

42
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:52.966
Then I'll cut it for you.

43
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.500
The knives of our Blood Jade Gate are notoriously fast.

44
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:57.533
Humph

45
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.300
Is it as fast as me?
