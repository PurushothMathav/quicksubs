00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.933
Okay, Miss.

2
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.900
I'll order someone to remove the herbs from the kitchen

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.100
Put it in the warehouse

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.300
Just give the little one the key.

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.900
Well, forget it.

6
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.400
What about these remaining medicinal materials?

7
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.966
I will deliver it in person.

8
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.000
Don't bother you

9
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.500
How can that work?

10
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.133
The warehouse has been abandoned for a long time

11
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.733
If the lady wants to deliver it in person

12
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.700
What should I do if I am disturbed?

13
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.166
Or say

14
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.800
There is a hidden secret in the warehouse

15
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.033
We can't know.

16
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.133
Husband, you are really overthinking

17
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.166
That gray place in the warehouse

18
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.700
What secrets could there be?

19
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.066
Forget it, since it's a nearby kindness

20
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.466
Then I'll drink it

21
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.133
This is for the body after all

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.400
So as not to put it in the warehouse and fall ash

23
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:44.966
come

24
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.366
Husband

25
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.666
Husband, this is

26
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.100
This is good stuff.

27
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.800
Of course we are.

28
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.666
Since you say it's a good way to refresh your mind

29
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.466
Then it must be good for your health.

30
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.300
Why don't you want to drink

31
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.000
Could it be that it was really poisoned in it?
