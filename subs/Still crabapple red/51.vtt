00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.466
Hey, it's impossible

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.633
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.366
Husband may wish to speak directly

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.266
I think my wife has an opinion on the people around me

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.566
It seems big

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.733
First Yuner

7
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.300
And then my mother and my sister.

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.700
Ah, of course.

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.800
This is their fault

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.833
But the attitude and words and deeds of the lady who came in

11
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.366
Compared to the old you

12
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.600
Much tougher

13
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.066
Make me feel unfamiliar

14
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.166
Have you ever thought about it?

15
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.200
I never understood you

16
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.366
Ah evergreen

17
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.033
Did you ever love me?

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.000
Why did the lady say that?

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
You marry me

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.466
Is it because you love me?

21
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.666
Or is it because you are property?

22
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:50.900
Ah.

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.400
If I said I married you because I love you

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.566
Does the lady believe it?

25
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.800
What do I think I'm saying now?

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.833
Madam doesn't believe it

27
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.633
Or, madam, you already have the answer in your heart

28
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.366
Evergreen, do I believe you?

29
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.666
After 3 days

30
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.600
At the Senate meeting of the Lin Consortium

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.866
Everything will be revealed
