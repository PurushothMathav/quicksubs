00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.133
Evergreen

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.600
I can return all your property to you

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.266
But that's nothing

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.133
I can do anything.

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.400
As long as you can forgive me

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.966
Anything?

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:12.966
Good idea.

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.666
Then you go to the guerrilla with him

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.733
Hang up I'm a bitch

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.200
My damn card soldier

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.066
This

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.233
Uh, what?

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.900
You don't want to?

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.200
No reluctance

15
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.166
After all, I am also the son-in-law of the Lin Mansion

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.200
If I were like this

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.000
Wouldn't it lose the face of Lin Mansion?

18
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.633
Now I know you are from Lin Mansion

19
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.966
That posture just now

20
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.666
I don't know, I thought you were my enemy

21
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.400
Ah no no no

22
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.700
No no no I dare not

23
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.533
Hurry up and make a choice

24
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.866
Do you want your bit of wealth or your face?

25
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.200
You need to know

26
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.100
Your face is worthless to this lady

27
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.866
This lady is still kind to you

28
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.266
Ah so spineless

29
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.900
Okay, that lady will not accompany you

30
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.100
I would.
