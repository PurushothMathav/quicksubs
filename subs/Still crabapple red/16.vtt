1
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.266
How is that possible?

2
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.233
How is that possible?

3
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.100
This Li Shuchang

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.700
These fingerprints are not allowed to match.

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.200
My sister has said it since she was a child

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.900
Our right thumb print

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.400
All have the same blood

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.833
Impossible Impossible

9
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.200
There is absolutely no way he is Chiwa's

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.800
How can someone come back to life?

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.866
Now you believe that I am the eldest lady of the Lin family, right?

12
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.000
Three Senators

13
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.466
Your property

14
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.366
Miss Ben smiled

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.566
mushy

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.066
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.300
Prime Minister

18
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.533
You bitch

19
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.633
Who let you fan the fire?

20
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.366
Evergreen usually looks at you gently and elegantly

21
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.366
You still hit women

22
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:58.266
You are the fox's tail finally exposed

23
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.066
I don't believe you are real

24
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.600
You must have something on your hands

25
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.166
What did you bring?

26
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.033
Still stubborn

27
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.300
Since Li Shuchang's fingerprints have been matched

28
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.566
From the professional point of view of your police department

29
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.800
My identity

30
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.633
Can there be fakes?

31
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.733
If the fingerprints match

32
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.666
Then he is indeed not fake

33
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.066
You are indeed the eldest lady of the palace

34
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.466
Absolutely.

35
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.066
Then why are you still standing here?

36
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.633
Ah, miss, goodbye, go, go, go

37
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.566
Miss

38
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.500
Helmet old eyes dim

39
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:48.066
Please don't know me in general.

40
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:49.500
Please atone for your sins

41
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.700
Be merciful, miss

42
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.300
Miss, rules are rules

43
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.200
If you make a mistake, you have to think about it.

44
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.166
And those who question my identity

45
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:01.233
Our souls will never tolerate it
