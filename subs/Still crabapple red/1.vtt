00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.500
Carry into the hole

4
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.300
Evergreen

5
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.500
Why is Yuner your evergreen?

6
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.066
Miss, the groom drank too much

7
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.333
Sober up

8
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.700
Come over in a while

9
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.900
Didn't I tell him to drink less alcohol?

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.466
Miss, don't worry

11
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.333
Drink this bowl of carbon medicine first

12
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.500
This is Yuna

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.000
Specially find the prescription that the old Chinese medicine doctor asked for you

14
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.300
As expected of my girl since childhood, she is really sensible

15
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.666
You go and find Evergreen

16
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.000
What's the matter?

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.966
Yun'er, where did you get the house from?

18
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.800
How come?

19
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.166
Yun'er, what did you give me to drink?

20
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.766
Miss

21
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:19.266
This is the abortion pill I made especially for you

22
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.200
How is it? It tastes good, right?

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
Hahahaha!

24
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.366
Hahaha

25
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.400
Hahahahaha

26
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.666
Ah, help!

27
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:35.966
Somebody help me!

28
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:36.900
Help!

29
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.166
Miss

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.433
Help!

31
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.666
Help me he will die

32
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.966
Waiting for the moon bomb

33
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.766
I made him do it.

34
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.833
And I let him poison him

35
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.166
Better to poison

36
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.100
But they

37
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.500
It's your children that can be ruined in my belly

38
00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:11.800
Child my miss linna

39
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.400
You don't really think our evergreen family will marry you

40
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.366
Is it for you?

41
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.200
What do you mean?

42
00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:19.766
To tell you the truth

43
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.866
The person I love the most in our evergreen family is me

44
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.833
You are just him for territorial property

45
00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:27.300
Using a flag

46
00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.200
Hahahaha

47
00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.366
Changqing, isn't he talking about talent? Changqing

48
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.500
Ah!

49
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What about the dignified house?

50
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.466
Haicheng's largest home

51
00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:39.500
Why are you the only team left?

52
00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:40.966
If you die

53
00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:42.500
The property of this government

54
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:45.766
Isn't it all my Song Changqing's?

55
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.666
Sister Bear

56
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.600
If my brother-in-law in my name

57
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.000
stink

58
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.166
Safe Path

59
00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.066
I am your governor

60
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.600
I have one person to lower the tube

61
00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:09.833
Ha ha.

62
00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:12.366
Hahaha

63
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:13.866
Ah!

64
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.166
Ring my red building station

65
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400
Tang Wangkao named me a reading officer

66
00:03:31.866 --> 00:03:32.666
think

67
00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:38.400
When you arrive at the meal, lock the door of the store

68
00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:41.800
Forced me to accompany me to the door

69
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.666
You have added it in Mandarin Duck.

70
00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.200
Mr. Song, your new wife

71
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.566
He actually committed suicide in the big red bowl

72
00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:57.100
Is there anything you want to say?

73
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.266
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

74
00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:03.100
But for the sake of my wife

75
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.166
For my beloved wife

76
00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:08.466
I swear I will never marry.

77
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.800
I am his natural maid

78
00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:16.633
It's me, I didn't take good care of the lady

79
00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:19.566
I didn't take good care of him

80
00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.900
It's not me as a husband

81
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.066
Did not serve my wife well

82
00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:26.266
I should die

83
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.900
Ahahaha

84
00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:31.566
Ah!
