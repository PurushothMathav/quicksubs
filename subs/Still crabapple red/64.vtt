00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.300
Miss Lin Qianyu

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.566
And a twin sister

3
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.900
How come we never know?

4
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.366
Yeah stinky woman

5
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.933
This dead knife still dares to quibble in winter

6
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:07.666
I see you even

7
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.466
The whimsical idea of a twin sister

8
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.600
Can say it

9
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.133
But it's professional laundry tablets.

10
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.866
I think you are using the art of entrepreneurship in the rivers and lakes

11
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.566
Hmph, you actually connected me?

12
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.566
Since you are my sister's natural maid

13
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.233
That's my maid

14
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.366
Who gave you the courage to treat your master like this?

15
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.600
You suck you

16
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.566
Don't think you can fool around with this little trick

17
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.866
Since you said you are Lin Qianyu's brother-in-law

18
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.100
The three elders here have been in the Lin Mansion for so many years

19
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.966
How come I've never heard of it?

20
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.500
That is.

21
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100
Lin Qianyu, as the eldest lady of the Li family

22
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.800
She has always been the only daughter of Master Li

23
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.600
We three elders grew up watching

24
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.300
How is that possible?

25
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.800
Suddenly a twin sister appeared

26
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.766
This is ridiculous.

27
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.700
When the eldest lady was born

28
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.400
The three of us came to the house to congratulate

29
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.366
The midwife only carried one girl in the house

30
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.100
Could it be that you jumped out of a crack in the stone?

31
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.900
Ahahaha

32
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.066
I see this counterfeit cheating

33
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.333
I lied to myself.

34
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.866
The secrets of our government

35
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.766
You people with foreign surnames deserve to know
