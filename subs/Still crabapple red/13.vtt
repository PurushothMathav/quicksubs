00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.066
I wonder if there is a possibility

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.766
The fingerprints on this autopsy are from my right hand

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.966
And you just drew

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.166
It's my left hand

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.200
Do you remember the autopsy?

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.100
Is the fingerprint left or right?

7
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.333
This

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.566
I can't remember this little one.

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.800
What do you do?

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.800
So what?

11
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.100
At most, can't you just draw the duck again?

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.566
That's it, draw it again

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.033
Make you a stinky woman completely ashamed

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.666
No one asked him to draw ducks

15
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.866
I'll do it myself

16
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.400
This lady's golden body was also touched by you.

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.666
Yo you stinky fake

18
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.600
The shelves are still on

19
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.466
You can draw and bet.

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.566
But if it proves that I am the real Miss Lin Mansion

21
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.900
How should you deal with it?

22
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.433
How do you deal with it?

23
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600
According to the rules of the Lin consortium

24
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.166
Wu Ni Sect Chief Ninja Get out of Lin Mansion

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.666
Free all property

26
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.233
Would you bet?

27
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.666
It seems that you don't dare to?

28
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.800
Since you can't be sure of my authenticity

29
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.833
Then there's no need to waste time

30
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.233
It's all gone

31
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.766
Bet on it
