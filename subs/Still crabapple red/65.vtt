00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.866
Our Linfu is the largest family in Haicheng

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.500
Naturally, there are many enemies

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.900
So from the day I was born

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.333
My parents sent me to the West

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.466
Toshio care

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.100
For the sake of one day

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.900
When we are in danger

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.566
Leave me as your last card

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.366
awake

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.900
It's so damn wonderful

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.400
I said, why don't you tell a story, you fake?

12
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.900
It's just genius

13
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.833
Since you said you are Lin Qianyu's twin sister

14
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.366
Evidence?

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.933
What about the evidence?

16
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.233
Of course I have proof

17
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.533
Do not believe

18
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.133
You can ask the three elders to send someone to Lin's ancestral hall

19
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.700
Get Lin's family tree and move it up

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.733
Look up there.

21
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.666
Is there any Lin Qianxun in three big characters?

22
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.466
presumptuous

23
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.666
Let three dignified elders marry your grandmother for you

24
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.166
You're just delusional

25
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.766
What else do you want to say to this counterfeit?

26
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:48.966
He just wants to buy time

27
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:49.700
Hurry up and find someone to do it

28
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.500
Hold on boss

29
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.000
Three elders

30
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.000
If you would like to help me today

31
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.933
I can count you as guilty and meritorious

32
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.700
As long as you can prove it for Miss Ben

33
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.200
I can return all your property

34
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.566
Three elders

35
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.966
Don't trust this woman

36
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.766
This man is as eloquent as a king

37
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.066
It doesn't take much to get up

38
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.000
Let's do it.
