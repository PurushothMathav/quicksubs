00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.066
You are really like a grudge

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.966
If you want to question my identity

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.900
Just show some real evidence

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.066
If you can't get it out

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.300
Shut your mouth

6
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.833
Of course I have proof

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.400
Here's the proof.

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.700
This guy was saying he was allergic to pollen.

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.466
Western medicine is required.

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.066
But we took this bottle of medicine for testing

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.500
Clearly fake

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.466
Exactly.

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.800
This is not an allergy medicine at all

14
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.566
It's obviously just a few flour dumplings

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.800
Is he fake?

16
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.566
Ok you Song Changqing

17
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.466
How dare you steal from me?

18
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.333
So shameless

19
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.500
Hahaha I steal

20
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.900
That's better than you stealing the identity of Miss Lin Mansion

21
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.466
Do you have anything else to say?

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
So what if it's fake?

23
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.566
This lady was indeed allergic to pollen before

24
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.300
But what does it prove now?

25
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.133
you

26
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.666
Are you shameless?

27
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.966
I thought if you could be ashamed

28
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.866
Take the initiative to admit it

29
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.700
Now compensable

30
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.566
To deal with shameless impostors like you

31
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.700
You don't have to.

32
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.000
That being the case

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.433
Then I won't throw you a way to live
