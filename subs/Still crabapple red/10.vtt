00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.666
I'm begging you later.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.400
Don't worry, that book manager, I've already taken care of it.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.033
Today I said he was fake.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.900
That's the truth.

5
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.300
Ouch

6
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.533
Director Li

7
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.333
I'm sorry to bother you so late, haha.

8
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.633
Is it all official business?

9
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.366
This is the forensic doctor on this case in the collar

10
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.700
It is also the most authoritative existence of the sea name

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.066
There must be seven tricks to this

12
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.500
Be sure to find out

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.800
Let the fraudsters be brought to justice

14
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.766
It seems that you don't believe me.

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800
Evergreen, you are my favorite person

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.300
I'll be sad if you do this.

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.066
Madam, you are also my favorite person

18
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.666
But I don't want my love

19
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.866
Have you been let down by a counterfeit?

20
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.900
It's the eldest lady of our Lin Mansion

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.666
Never be impersonated by outsiders

22
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.700
You man and woman

23
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.766
It's really a bit like singing for women

24
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.900
These people don't know

25
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.800
I thought you two were the perfect match

26
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.366
Stop talking nonsense is true or false

27
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.766
Let the forensic doctor prove it

28
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.066
This is the death report of Lin Qianyu, the eldest lady of the Lin Family

29
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.600
Confirmed as suicide by poisoning

30
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.900
No sign of homicide

31
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.500
The victim showed no signs of life at the scene

32
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.600
So it's scientifically impossible.

33
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.066
Impossible to survive

34
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.800
Then he must be a jerk

35
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.633
Yes, it's a jerk

36
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:32.166
Madam, I want to believe you too

37
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.933
But you and I are both people who have read books

38
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.433
We have to believe in science.

39
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.066
How do you prove yourself now?

40
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.966
Is it the real Lin Qianyu?
