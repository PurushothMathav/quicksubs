00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.766
I don't know about these three old guys

2
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.000
What are you doing here so late?

3
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.900
The matter of the temporary consortium leader

4
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.433
Nothing will go wrong?

5
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.466
What did the three elders do to arrange the formation of Bumara?

6
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.000
Tomorrow Linfu will remove the wall

7
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.566
We're here to see if everything is going well

8
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.800
Everything went well.

9
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.166
Why wait until tomorrow?

10
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.133
In my opinion, I will bury it casually tonight

11
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.700
The anti-war Liu family is dead

12
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.200
Child, why are you talking about so many rules?

13
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.733
Li Lao said more

14
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.666
This neighbor is really hateful.

15
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.900
while alive

16
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.266
It's closed for the three of us

17
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.366
Dead now

18
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.900
That's very exciting.

19
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.366
Ah, hey, hey, hey.

20
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.000
Evergreen

21
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.866
Now the Lin family is leaderless

22
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.766
But fortunately, you have recruited such a good son-in-law

23
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.266
In my opinion, from now on

24
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.900
You should be the leader of the Lin's consortium

25
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.566
Well, it seems that the three senators are on the same front as me

26
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.000
False alarm

27
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.866
A bunch of wolf-hearted things

28
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.333
My sister is still alive

29
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.900
They actually want to divide up my temporary property one by one

30
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.200
I won't let any of you go

31
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.333
Evergreen, if you become the leader

32
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.333
How should this meat be divided in the future?

33
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.400
We don't have to say more.

34
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.800
Please rest assured.

35
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800
Evergreen will never live up to your love

36
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.966
Since everyone has this intention

37
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.800
That evergreen will no longer refuse

38
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.733
Three days later at the Yuen Long conference

39
00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:17.700
Evergreen officially saves lives

40
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.166
Since it's so complicated, you don't need it.

41
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.866
Come and become an official

42
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.033
Quick burial tonight
