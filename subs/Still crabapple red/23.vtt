1
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.066
Or a quilt of rotten eggs

2
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.600
Evergreen, you have written it

3
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.266
This is Lin Mansion

4
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.700
I was also seen by the woman surnamed Lin

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.400
Isn't it embarrassing enough?

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.766
Don't mention that Lin guy to me

7
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.866
I'm not afraid of him

8
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:27.733
I see

9
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.500
You just want to watch what's in the bowl and eat what's in the pot

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.400
Don't want to touch me anymore

11
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.166
Evergreen, haven't you seen it yet?

12
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.500
He's an impostor.

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.766
Of course I know.

14
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.400
But how can we prove it?

15
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.900
Okay, wait until this is resolved.

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.200
This Lin Mansion is not ours yet

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.700
I have found a way

18
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.666
How?

19
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.100
The dusty warehouse of Lin Mansion

20
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.666
Re-sealed

21
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm guessing what's most likely to go inside

22
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.900
Chiwa's remains

23
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.433
Just thought of a piece

24
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.733
However, the lock in that warehouse cannot be opened

25
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.233
Only get the key

26
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.166
I'll go along and invite him to dinner tonight

27
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.300
Jia Yi apologized to him

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.300
Use the warehouse again

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.166
I don't trust them.

30
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.200
And you keep thinking.

31
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.533
Force him to give up the key

32
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.100
To get a handle on him

33
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.566
What should I do then?
