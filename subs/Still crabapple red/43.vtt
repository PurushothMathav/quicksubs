00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.900
Okay, okay, okay, your family's play

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.366
It's really wonderful

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.300
What are you talking about, you impostor?

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.766
I already knew

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.200
Your weasel doesn't have a good heart to pay New Year's greetings to the chicken

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.966
How dare you speak to my mother like that, you fake

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.933
But also

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.166
You're not some dying news at all

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.866
Of course there is no tutoring

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.700
Force your stinky mouth to follow this lady

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.866
Miss Ben

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.200
I think you are an actor and you believe it yourself

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.366
I'll tell you what.

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.900
The money in this Lin mansion belongs to my brother

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.733
Don't try to cheat a penny

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.166
If you were Miss Lin

17
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.033
I should have gone to the hospital today

18
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.000
This is western medicine given to me by my personal doctor Mike

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.500
It is very effective in preventing pollen allergies

20
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.000
August osmanthus fragrance

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.566
He told me everything.

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600
Is there something wrong with that?

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.066
Oh, I forgot.

24
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.966
A down-and-out household like your Song family should

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.033
Can't afford a private doctor?
