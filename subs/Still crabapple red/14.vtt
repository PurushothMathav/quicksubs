1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm really willing to give up all my worth today

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.733
Send you fake in

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.200
Boss, even if the sun hits the west today

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.900
I don't believe you're really right either.

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.600
Bet with him on three veteran donkeys

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.366
It's time to pay for your coffin

7
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.433
But don't blame this lady for being ruthless

8
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.533
Evergreen

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.466
How about you?

10
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.033
Evergreen, are you still afraid of him?

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.366
Evergreen, you must always remember

12
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.666
You're just a doorstep to our neighbor

13
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.300
How much property can you have?

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.033
These three elders are not afraid

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500
What are you afraid of?

16
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.933
Evergreen, don't be afraid of him

17
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.366
Wait for him to go to jail

18
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.100
See how long he can stay in power. Shut up

19
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.900
I'll paint it.

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.866
Great, as expected of the man that Miss Ben likes

21
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.666
kind of

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.033
Then draw a duck like that

23
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.233
Ah, and draw ducks

24
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.200
Of course it's clearly written in black and white

25
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.866
Otherwise

26
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.266
Do you think this lady is playing house with you?

27
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.666
statement

28
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:14.266
Dazzling gamblers who admit defeat can dissolve the Lingshi consortium

29
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.000
Give up everything voluntarily

30
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.566
You fake

31
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.766
You really don't cry without seeing the coffin?

32
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.533
It's pretty decent

33
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.600
I'll see how long you can wait

34
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.000
Don't be complacent.

35
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.166
What do you know?
