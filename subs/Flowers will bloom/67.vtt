00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.900
You are giving me face

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.966
Or for soba noodles?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.666
Lu Chengyu, I have been by your side for so long

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.200
Can't it be worth the original lullaby of his buckwheat?

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.466
You won't lose a single hair of his.

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.166
I can't compare to him

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.866
He is so ugly and so fat, I can't compare to him.

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.133
Lu Chengyu, I lied to you

9
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.900
So you hate me, I admit it.

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.133
But I don't believe you know

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.100
The person who was by your side at the beginning was buckwheat

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.233
Will still like him

13
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.966
That's true.

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.966
Buckwheat is so fat

15
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.633
Most men can't stand it

16
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.900
Even if I knew that he was

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.200
It is estimated that Mr. Lu will not like him either

18
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.333
Even here

19
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.766
That Jiang Yurou was also dipped in the light of other people's buckwheat

20
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.433
If Mr. Lu is mistaken

21
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.766
How can there be such a thing as Jiang Yurou?

22
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.866
Did you hear it?

23
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.300
That's what they say.

24
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.166
Yes

25
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.700
I am staying by your side in place of buckwheat

26
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.766
But even if I wasn't lying

27
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.600
You can't possibly like buckwheat.

28
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.633
There will still be other women by your side

29
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.666
I love buckwheat.

30
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.766
Pardon me?

31
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.666
And I said, "I love buckwheat."

32
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.966
I like it.

33
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.666
He has always been the one who accompanied me

34
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.600
He is so ugly and so fat

35
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.400
His family is broke, he has nothing

36
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.566
Why do you like him?

37
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.966
When I met him

38
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.233
I have no idea what he looks like

39
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.300
I love

40
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.166
It has always been the one who accompanied me through the lows

41
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.800
The voice that sings lullabies to accompany me to sleep

42
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.366
Nothing else.
