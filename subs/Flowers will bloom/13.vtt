00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.033
Why is no one controlling me?

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.200
What is your relationship with Mr. Lu?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.466
What is your identity?

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.833
Who is this woman?

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.833
I'm beautiful. Muse

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.466
100 times more beautiful than the big star ginger down

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.833
What did he just say?

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.300
He is so beautiful.

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.600
I just look at my face

10
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.000
Didn't hear what he said

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.500
He seems to have said just now that Mr. Lu has not divorced yet

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.266
Could it be that he is the legendary Mrs. Lu?

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.300
How is that possible?

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.766
Mrs. Lu is an ugly, fat woman

15
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.766
How could it be this one in front of you?

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.966
What about the beautiful woman who stunned the four seats?

17
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.466
Who are you?

18
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.100
It's not your place to speak

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.366
Don't remember me

20
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.833
It's okay if you don't remember

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.933
Because of what happened next

22
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.600
You will never forget

23
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.600
It doesn't matter who you are

24
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.900
Here's the thing.

25
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.366
Do you know who the woman in front of you is?

26
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.566
Really know

27
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.066
What is Jiang Yurou's true face like?

28
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.100
Who are you?

29
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.533
I don't even know you.

30
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.766
You don't know me.

31
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:14.900
I know you.

32
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.500
I don't just know you

33
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.266
I also know all the songs you have sung over the years

34
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.200
They all got someone to sing for them
