00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.366
Come and eat!

2
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.066
No, no, I can't eat that much.

3
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.933
How are you still pretending in front of me?

4
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.833
It's not that I don't know your appetite

5
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.033
Chunyu, why are your dark circles so heavy?

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.900
Did you not sleep well last night?

7
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.666
That's right.

8
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.200
Today I have a friend coming to my house to talk about something

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.433
You pack up

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.233
But idiom

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.500
I'm so ugly and fat

12
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.800
Won't you be ashamed?

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.166
Now that you are married

14
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.733
You are Mrs. Lu

15
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.766
I told you before.

16
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.666
Our marriage is about mutual benefit

17
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:48.733
The Qiao family helped me before

18
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.700
I naturally recognize who you are

19
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.666
It has nothing to do with your appearance or figure

20
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.066
He is so nice

21
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.433
As expected of the male god I have had a crush on for so long

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.000
I've been having a bad time lately

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.166
A lot of pressure.

24
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.500
Been insomnia

25
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.000
I must take all the responsibilities for my family

26
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.300
Sometimes I feel like

27
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.000
What's the point of living like this?

28
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.766
Sorry, I don't know how to help you.

29
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.166
You said you couldn't sleep?

30
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.400
I'll sing you a lullaby, okay?

31
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.500
Zhang Yu, you really married me now

32
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.033
But don't know

33
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.100
Do you remember

34
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.500
The girl who sang lullabies to you

35
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.300
Wait until the Qiao family gets through the crisis

36
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.566
I will officially
