00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.066
You are so pretty in this dress.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.200
Down, which female star is this?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.866
How come I've never seen shut up

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.700
Why is it you again?

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.766
It's haunting

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.866
Who do you say is haunted?

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.300
Good dogs don't get in the way

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.600
I'll say whoever gets in my way

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.566
Don't talk

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.866
Has he not paid for this dress yet? He has not paid for it yet.

11
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.566
I'll take it. Wrap this skirt up for me.

12
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.200
Forget about robbing men

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.666
Grab a skirt too

14
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.633
Grab the idiom was originally mine

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.866
Are you sure no one knows what you do?

16
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.466
What nonsense are you talking about?

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.666
Is it buckwheat?

18
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.866
Did Mai really tell him the truth about that year?

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.133
It's impossible.

20
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.933
I like this dress

21
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.800
Peel it off for me

22
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.966
I don't know. First come, first served.

23
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.066
Just go back and let your parents teach you better

24
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.566
This store is all about luxury goods

25
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.900
You can afford it.
