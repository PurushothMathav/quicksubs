00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.666
Let go of me let go of me

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Cheng Yu Cheng Yu, please forgive me once, okay?

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.466
The ones I've been with you for so long

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.900
You won't like him even if you find buckwheat

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.566
After all, he is so ugly and fat.

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.766
I told you I didn't care what he looked like.

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.866
All I care about is being with me

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.966
People around you

9
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:21.500
And that

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.266
The sound that has accompanied me through countless days and nights

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.600
Do you like his voice?

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.966
I can also learn

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.600
I sound like him, after all

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.700
I would like to learn for you

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.833
shut up

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.833
You will never compare to him

17
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.900
Cheng Yu Cheng Yu

18
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.500
Let go of me!

19
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.566
But I am now

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.266
I can't sing like I used to

21
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.166
Why are you running?

22
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.033
Mr. Lu, please respect yourself

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Sister Joe, do you want to see him that much?

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.733
She's my wife.

25
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.300
Aren't you going to divorce him?

26
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.266
What do you need him for?

27
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.033
Who said I was going to divorce him?

28
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.466
He is the wife I am officially married to

29
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.133
And I've been looking for him for so long

30
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.000
How could I possibly divorce him?

31
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.666
Why don't you dislike him as a pig?
