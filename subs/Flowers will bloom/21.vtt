Not a member

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.200
I was just speaking for a while

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.100
You still take me for a fool, don't you?

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.300
I don't have it.

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.600
What you said is true.

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.100
The person who split Jiang Yurou was buckwheat

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.600
Even if he is buckwheat

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.866
What does it have to do with you?

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.100
She's my wife.

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.066
Didn't you send a divorce to Dad Buckwheat long ago?

11
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.866
Do you want to divorce him?

12
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.700
I have never put buckwheat in my heart

13
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.133
Treat it like a real wife

14
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.200
How did you know I sent the divorce papers to Joe's house?

15
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.700
Come on, he feels familiar to me

16
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.000
Especially his voice

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.533
Buckwheat told me, of course.

18
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.833
Otherwise, who else could it be?

19
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:40.433
You lie, buckwheat is ugly and fat, and you have low self-esteem to die for.

20
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.566
I don't even have a friend in reality

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.566
Who are you?

22
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.866
Why frame me

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.166
Why lie to me?

24
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.866
Ginger down

25
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
If you weren't guilty, you would be afraid of being told by me

26
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.600
You admitted it yourself just now

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.266
You give buckwheat money to advocate for you

28
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.166
I just made a slip of the tongue

29
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.166
Do you have any evidence?

30
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.566
Who are you?

31
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.466
What's your relationship with buckwheat?

32
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Where is he now?
