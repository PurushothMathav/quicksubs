00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.833
Are you sure you can afford this dress?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.233
I can't afford it.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.766
Can you afford it?

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.533
Buckwheat depends on me to advocate

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.700
Go into debt with your dad

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.766
You are just enough for him

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.400
I'll take this one.

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.200
Wrap it up for me

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.733
He couldn't afford to wrap it up for me.

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.900
Why don't you two discuss it again?

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.200
What to discuss?

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.600
Do you know who I am?

13
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.000
I told you

14
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.366
He can't afford the skirt at all.

15
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.400
What are you hesitating about?

16
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.500
This lady

17
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.566
Why don't you take a look at other styles?

18
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.066
You are like ginger down

19
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.966
I also think I can't afford down, but I'm a big star

20
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.933
How could I slander you for no reason?

21
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.966
If you can't afford it, don't try it.

22
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.033
Take it off now

23
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.866
Then you can pay for the down now.

24
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.900
It's not too late for me to return

25
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.966
It's just a skirt.

26
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.100
You thought I couldn't afford it

27
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.800
Give me 10

28
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.333
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

29
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.400
insufficient balance

30
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.833
How is that possible?

31
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.233
Didn't you say buy 10?

32
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:07.833
Buy it.
