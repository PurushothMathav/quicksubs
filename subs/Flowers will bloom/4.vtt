00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.100
Chen handles it

2
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.966
Mr. Lu, you still can't sleep?

3
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.566
Bring me some more of this sleeping pill.

4
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.300
Mr. Lu

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.200
You have always been able to listen to Miss Jiang's songs

6
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.000
To sleep

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.466
You can't stage this reaction

8
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.700
Just take this sleeping pill

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.400
Or I'll bring you the recording

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.700
Listen to sleep

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.500
Why is that?

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.600
Why can I only fall asleep listening to that voice?

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.800
The rest of the universe doesn't work.

14
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.400
I have work tomorrow.

15
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.800
Bring the recorder

16
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.600
I've been having a bad time lately

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.566
A lot of pressure.

18
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.866
Been insomnia

19
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.366
I must take all the responsibilities for my family

20
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.933
Sometimes

21
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.200
I think what's the point of living like this

22
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.200
Sorry, I don't know how to help you.

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.666
You said you couldn't sleep?

24
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.900
I'll sing you a lullaby, okay?

25
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.233
Thanks.

26
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.100
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to make it through

27
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.600
Wait until I accept the group

28
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600
Let's meet officially, okay?

29
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.266
If you wait for me, I will definitely marry you.
