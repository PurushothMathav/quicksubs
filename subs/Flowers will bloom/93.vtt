00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.900
It's all my fault

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.733
Then I misunderstood you before.

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.833
Don't I deserve to be misunderstood by you now?

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.566
I guess you're right.

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.700
I've been singing with you for so many years

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.933
You didn't recognize me.

7
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.166
You deserve it now.

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.166
Yes I deserve it

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.900
So I can only suffer

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.633
As long as you can vent your anger

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.666
You didn't know it at the time.

12
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.100
The woman by your side is me

13
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.933
We are just a business marriage

14
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.566
Why are you being so nice to me?

15
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.600
Really don't know

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.266
Although you were so fat and ugly at that time

17
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.266
But I'm always cruel to you

18
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.300
Only Mrs. Chen once

19
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.200
I couldn't help but lose my temper with you.

20
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.666
But I also regretted it afterwards

21
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.433
After all, I still think I'm fat

22
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.366
No business

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.933
I am a man who knows the dead

24
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.266
As long as it's someone I like

25
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.100
I would love him no matter what he looks like

26
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:54.600
that

27
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.233
If you had known from the beginning that that woman was me

28
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.866
But I'm fat

29
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.266
You will still like me

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.466
Will perfunctory me

31
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.700
Why am I perfunctory to you?

32
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.133
I'm not deceiving you either.

33
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.533
Bye as long as it's someone I like

34
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.066
I like him no matter what he looks like

35
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:14.000
Even if he is the reincarnation of a pig spirit, I will like it

36
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.166
You are the pig spirit

37
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.500
Your whole family is a pig spirit

38
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.000
So my small rent

39
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.666
When will you come home with me?

40
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.133
See your performance

41
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.066
You're on probation right now.

42
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.433
How long will the inspection period be?

43
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.066
that

44
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.400
Just a lifetime

45
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.166
A lifetime.

46
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.600
You dare to study with me for a lifetime
