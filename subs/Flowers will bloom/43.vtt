00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.366
So what if you had a whole store?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.100
I have idioms

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.566
Give me a unique dress

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.866
Who are you scolding for this guy?

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.400
You'd better keep your promise.

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.966
Tell the idiom the whereabouts of buckwheat

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.933
Or I'll charge you with fraud

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.200
The people sent out last time didn't succeed.

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.266
This time, we must solve the buckwheat problem.

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.533
Get rid of this woman by the way

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.900
It's an eyesore.

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.166
Do you really want Lu Chengyu to meet Buckwheat?

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.566
Of course I hope so.

14
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.233
Don't provoke our relationship

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.633
Miss Lu Zongxiao

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Make way

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.833
My one-of-a-kind dress

18
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm sorry, Miss Xiao

19
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.000
We can't sell this dress.

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.733
Why did I just ask our boss?

21
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.666
Our boss said

22
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.866
This dress is for a distinguished guest

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.733
So you can't buy it.

24
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.466
Are you making up some lie?

25
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.933
I know your boss.

26
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.633
The industry's top fashionistas reveal the secrets

27
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.833
Ordinary people disdain to deal with

28
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.966
What kind of distinguished guest can have such a big face?

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:02.233
I already said this dress is for me

30
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.766
You are still dreaming here in broad daylight
