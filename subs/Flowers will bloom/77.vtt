00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.866
Lu Chengyu shouldn't come again in the future, right?

2
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.166
Meituan, give me back everything that belongs to me

3
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.500
You are sick

4
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.633
It's all you, you took everything that belonged to me

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.400
My Job

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.900
My Glory

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.366
My fans and my man

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.966
This is all because you came from the Nagato Bridge

9
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.100
Now it's just returning what doesn't belong to you.

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.000
i

11
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.033
Hello excellence

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800
How have you been?

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
Are you all right?

14
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.433
I'm fine idiom

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.900
I'm the one who has something to do

16
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.100
All my work has been suspended

17
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.866
Don't you have any feelings for me?

18
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.166
I warn you.

19
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.033
Don't seek sympathy with stolen identities

20
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.266
All my affection for you

21
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.066
All because you are buckwheat

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.466
And this goodwill

23
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.366
It's also worn out in your words and deeds

24
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.500
Without you claiming his identity

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.933
A woman like you

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.000
I won't even look at you

27
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.033
Where do you intend to go?

28
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.833
I'll send you.

29
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.433
Even if you are courting me now

30
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.733
I won't pick you up, don't worry.

31
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.600
I just want to send it to you.

32
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.366
Hey, don't worry.

33
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.400
I didn't mean to pester you.

34
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.033
I don't want to be wrapped around buckwheat either

35
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.900
I just want to make up for it.

36
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.033
Is the idiom interested in Wei Da now?

37
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:46.033
No. I won't let that happen.

38
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.766
Mingyue, do something for me
