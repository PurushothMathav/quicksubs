00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.766
They're all looking for someone to replace them

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.300
You shut up you are talking nonsense

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:09.433
Why did I panic before I could say anything more exciting?

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.800
Chengyu, don't listen to his nonsense

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.766
I have no idea what he's talking about.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.566
Is there any evidence for what you just said?

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.866
It's easy to prove that you're not looking for a replacement

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.566
How about you sing a song in front of everyone?

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.433
Why doesn't he sing?

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.100
Why doesn't he sing?

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.633
Is it really impossible for Jiang Yurou?

12
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.533
This Jiang Yurou

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.833
It was because of the good singing

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.666
If he does ask for a replacement

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.066
So are you taking the listeners for fools?

16
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:38.733
Ah!

17
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.633
I also don't think he is so bold to cause trouble

18
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.300
What the hell is going on?

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:47.166
Do you believe me, this woman?

20
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.933
She must have been sent by the family to smear me

21
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.100
Such a simple way to prove yourself

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.566
You dare not try

23
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.433
Don't you want to?

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.600
Still dare not
