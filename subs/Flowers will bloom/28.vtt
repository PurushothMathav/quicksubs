00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.100
What do you want to say?

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.100
Let go! Who the hell am I?

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.033
Why do you know so much about buckwheat?

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.700
Where the hell is he now?

5
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.566
Why don't you come out and see me yourself?

6
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.733
You don't care about him

7
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:17.533
Why are you asking these?

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.766
Who says I don't care?

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.966
Are you trying to say

10
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.600
He doesn't want to see me.

11
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.233
Just want to divorce me

12
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.633
Yes, then let him talk to me himself

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.600
You have already signed the divorce agreement

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.800
He has signed

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.966
What else is there to talk about?

16
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.366
If he read the divorce papers

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.000
Then know that all the conditions are blank

18
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.766
I'm waiting for him to come and talk to me himself

19
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.833
Who are you?

20
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.600
Why have I been married to Buckwheat for so many years?

21
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.366
I've never heard of him around

22
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.233
Have you as a good friend

23
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.900
Of course you haven't heard of it.

24
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.300
Because you never put the front row

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.100
Treat it like a real wife

26
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.466
Naturally, he won't know what other friends he has around him
