00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.366
Who land

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.000
Lu Chengyu?

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.966
He made a guarantee before I shot

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.200
Speaking of which, you should thank him Lu Chengyu

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.166
Why don't you know about this?

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.333
Why did he do that?

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.866
He asked me for help many times

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.900
Just to get Mr. Joe out of bankruptcy

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.466
I went to your wedding room, do you remember?

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.266
We had a bad day.

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.400
Remember when you weren't thin yet

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.166
However, Mr. Lu treats you very well

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.500
Although it is a business marriage

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.600
But he is willing to sacrifice his own interests

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.033
To help your father pay off his debt

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.400
that day

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.466
Lu Chengyu said that he has something very important to discuss with you

18
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.600
It turned out to be to help my dad pay off his debt

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:45.166
Yeah, why do you look so surprised?

20
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.566
Didn't he tell you?

21
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.600
Manman, I really don't know about this.

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000
I always thought it was Mrs. Chen who helped

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.966
dare not be

24
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.800
Your mess was so big

25
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.733
No one dared to help

26
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.266
It was Mr. Lu who took out tens of billions of guarantees as sincerity

27
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.066
I just shot

28
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.066
I dare not take this credit slowly
