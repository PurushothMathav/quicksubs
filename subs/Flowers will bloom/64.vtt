00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.900
I've seen it on the red carpet

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.933
It's really rare to rub seats

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.600
And especially those who are kicked out by the staff

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.066
Even rarer

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:11.000
It is estimated that the Internet is laughing at Jiang Yurong now

6
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.833
Will it be buckwheat?

7
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.700
But how can a person do it in just a few months?

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.866
So thin

9
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.233
Buckwheat, where the hell are you?

10
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.466
The last award today

11
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.733
It's our best performance award

12
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.266
The winner is Jiang Yurong

13
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.266
Thank you for your support.

14
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.100
Thank you fans for liking it too.

15
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.366
I really didn't expect me to win the award too

16
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.400
Because of the previous advocacy turmoil

17
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.500
I was framed by someone with a heart, so

18
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.666
What's wrong with ginger down?

19
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.300
You did it on purpose

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.100
I am afraid

21
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.333
But at least I helped you make you popular

22
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.766
What makes you say that?

23
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.133
You help me if I hadn't found your voice

24
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.866
How do you pay off your debt with your family?

25
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.866
Can you let the idioms help you pay it back?

26
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.433
Don't tell the idiom

27
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.300
I don't want to drag him down

28
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.066
Let me tell you a secret.

29
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.866
I know you didn't spoil me back then

30
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.466
However, he thought that woman was me

31
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.866
After all, it sounds so good

32
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.666
How can it belong to you?
