00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.600
You're not Witt

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.566
What are you standing there for?

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.400
This is not an occasion where you can mess around

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.000
Come down quickly

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.200
Wasn't that dress on him burned?

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.000
Only the waist and skirt were burned

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.133
Make the layers of this skirt look more textured

8
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.333
Works better

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.966
This is too beautiful, right?

10
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.366
It's just gorgeous

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.500
It's not even just pretty.

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.900
There is a beauty that is reborn from the ashes

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.933
You think it's just a dress

14
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.700
Can you steal today's limelight?

15
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.500
It's Witt Prize time.

16
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.166
You are a vase of nothing

17
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.600
Come down quickly

18
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.833
The universe is a public place

19
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.033
I'm sorry, Sung Woo

20
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.100
Do you think I've embarrassed you?

21
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.300
But I'm fighting for Werther.

22
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.300
This is obviously the moment he won the award

23
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.233
But was upstaged by this shameless woman

24
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.366
Thank you very much.

25
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.366
I am Wei

26
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.666
Impossible for so many years

27
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.966
I have never appeared in front of the palace

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:04.866
today

29
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.233
I want to stand in the spotlight

30
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.800
Take back my trophy upright
