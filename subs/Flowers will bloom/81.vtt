00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.566
Waiting for Buffett

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to take the humiliation you gave me that day

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.466
All back to you

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.066
And I want to thank somebody very special.

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.666
He just won the Albert Award.

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.666
You call him Witty

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.233
We congratulate him together

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.566
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.466
I'm going to expose Whit's true face

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.566
He's not a beautiful woman musician

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.100
he

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.100
Just a mean woman who rose to power by dirty means

13
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.600
Isn't this Jiang Yirou?

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.800
What is he doing here?

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.766
He just said

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.100
Witt got to the top by those dirty tricks

17
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.466
What does he mean?

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.200
This lady

19
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.433
Talking is about evidence

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.266
Witt, don't think I don't know

21
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.300
Those works you won

22
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.166
All are composed by buckwheat

23
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.600
I went through all the Witt Prizes.

24
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.233
The original copyright registration is all robbed

25
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.400
Later, it was changed to Witt.

26
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.533
It's really the original host, it's all buckwheat

27
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.233
This Mrs. Lu is really miserable

28
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.966
First sing for Jiang Yurou

29
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.066
Now the work has been accepted by Witt

30
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.733
Just now, Mr. Lu made a public gesture to Witt

31
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:20.800
You said Mrs. Lu knew how sad it should be

32
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.966
Is it because Mrs. Lu is fat?

33
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.366
To bully her like this

34
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.866
Witt now has the evidence in front of you

35
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.700
What else do you have to deny?

36
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.666
I never thought of denying it.

37
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.266
You're telling the truth.

38
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.800
These works

39
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.900
It is indeed written by buckwheat
