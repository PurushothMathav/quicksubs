00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.300
How is that possible?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.833
It's impossible. It must be a mistake.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.166
Yeah, even buckwheat is just a down-and-out daughter

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.766
He's just Buckwheat's sidekick

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.466
How could it be a distinguished guest?

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.566
Sorry, that's what our boss explained.

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.366
That's impossible.

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.966
Are you mistaken?

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.966
No mistake.

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.200
Our boss said

11
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.300
The guest is him

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.266
He is expensive

13
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.100
Why did you keep him quiet?

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Are you feeling guilty?

15
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.166
That must be it.

16
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.666
I said why are you suddenly pretending?

17
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.866
It turned out that he had impersonated someone else's identity.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.066
Fake identity

19
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.566
Or is Miss Jiang more pure gold?

20
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.633
What do you mean?

21
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.400
Idiom, don't listen to his nonsense

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.666
He just wants to provoke our relationship

23
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.266
Let's talk about what's in front of us

24
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.900
Are you the guest here?

25
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.933
Or are you lying?

26
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.600
Yeah, that's for sure.

27
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.500
Yu Rao asked him to kneel down and apologize to you

28
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.466
Let him bark like a dog

29
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.566
Let him learn how to crawl

30
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.966
The golden secret is me

31
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.200
You tell them.

32
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.266
Who is this dress for?

33
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.300
You go answer the phone

34
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.000
See if it's your boss.

35
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.633
Okay, okay.

36
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.566
This is indeed our boss.

37
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.900
That's impossible.

38
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.633
But it's just Buckwheat's sidekick

39
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.500
How could you possibly know such a powerful figure?
