00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.400
不是他不想跟你说

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.600
是你根本就没有给他机会

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.466
我当时确实生气

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.633
可那也是因为有误会

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.433
所以才对他发了脾气

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.566
他之后为什么不说

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.333
陆总你要不要好好想一想

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.366
那天之后发生了什么事情

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.300
需要我帮你好好回忆一下

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.100
在这个项目上我耗费了多少心血

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.766
可是你能拿他怎么办呢

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.366
毕竟他还是你的太太

13
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.033
早知道今天我早就应该跟他离婚

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.200
苍宇

15
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.066
这是你的真心话吗

16
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.866
真的想跟我离婚吗

17
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.966
我这辈子做过最后悔的事情

18
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.000
就是跟你结婚

19
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.066
你也跟外面那些人一样

20
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.000
觉得我是一头又丑又肥的猪

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.900
对吗

22
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.966
你也知道外面那些人怎么说你

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.166
你的确又丑又肥

24
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.266
但我说我可以容忍你找人相助

25
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.166
我接受不了你脑子也是一头猪

26
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.566
我知道了

27
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.400
所以那天他出车祸

28
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.466
是因为我骂了他

29
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.400
It's not that he doesn't want to tell you.

30
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.600
You didn't give him a chance at all

31
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.466
I was angry.

32
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.633
But that's also because of a misunderstanding.

33
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.433
So I got angry with him

34
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.566
Why didn't he say anything after that?

35
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.333
Mr. Lu, do you want to think about it?

36
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.366
What happened after that day?

37
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.300
Need me to help you remember

38
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.100
How much effort did I put into this project?

39
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.766
But what can you do with him?

40
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.366
After all, he is still your wife

41
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.033
I should have divorced him a long time ago today

42
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.200
Cangyu

43
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.066
Is that true?

44
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.866
Do you really want to divorce me?

45
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.966
The thing I regret the most in my life

46
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.000
Is to marry you

47
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.066
You are just like those people out there

48
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.000
Think I'm an ugly and fat pig

49
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.900
Right?

50
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.966
You know what those people outside say about you

51
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.166
You are ugly and fat

52
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.266
But I said I could tolerate you looking for help

53
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.166
I can't accept that your brain is also a pig.

54
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.566
Oh, I see.

55
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.400
So he got in a car accident that day.

56
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.466
It's because I scolded him
