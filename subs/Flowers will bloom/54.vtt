00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.900
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.833
We only accept invitations.

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.766
Tower top invitation

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.233
There is indeed a super VIP logo on it.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.000
There really is a different fat Jinluo boy

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.500
idiom

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.000
Can you show me your invitation letter?

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.600
I'm worried that someone has forged the invitation.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.766
If he wants to see it, show it to him

10
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.000
Don't die until you reach the Yellow River

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.666
Just don't be like that day in the Shooting Hall

12
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.266
Just get your little sidekick to kneel and apologize for you

13
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.000
Just show me the idiom

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.366
False invitation letter

15
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.266
But you will be invited out by the organizers.

16
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.500
As long as you speak

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.300
I can say hi to them.

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.566
It's convenient for you.

19
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.333
Why do you think I got a fake invitation?

20
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.600
Swaggering

21
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:55.033
I'm just giving you the whole way not to make a fool of yourself

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.633
When did Mr. Lu become so conscientious?

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.600
You help me like this

24
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.166
What's in it for you?

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.666
As long as you tell me buckwheat

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.066
I can give you a true friendship

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.200
You just want to know where the buckwheat is?

28
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.900

29
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.100
Go ahead.

30
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.300
Just don't tell
