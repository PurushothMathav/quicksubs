1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.033
Mrs. Chen will come over later.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.166
I have a very important project at hand

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.166
Need his nod

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.966
He is on good terms with his husband.

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:11.766
So more

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.133
Tend to choose partners who are loving couples

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.666
Can you see what I mean?

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.766
Yes, I see.

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.266
Chen Yu, don't worry.

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.800
I will definitely perform well in front of Mrs. Chen

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.066
Ok you know

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.066
I have always been focused on work

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.200
But don't worry.

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.700
After our divorce

15
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.833
I'll give you enough money.

16
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.766
Pack you and your father's harem

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.066
I don't want your money.

18
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.466
I want your man

19
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.433
It's beautiful what you think

20
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.500
Buckwheat, don't you look at your fat

21
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.233
What's the difference between it and a pig?

22
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.500
What's wrong with fat

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.666
I ate your rice

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.300
Why do you say that I'm not only as fat as a pig

25
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.233
He is also worried like a pig

26
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.266
Ginger down, you did it on purpose

27
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.100
I am afraid

28
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.266
But at least I helped you make you popular

29
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.766
What makes you say that?

30
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.933
Help me if I hadn't found your voice

31
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.466
You are a bankrupt daughter

32
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.000
How to pay off the debt at home

33
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.800
Is it possible to let the idiom help you remand?

34
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.233
Don't tell Chen Yu

35
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.966
Don't want to drag him down

36
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.233
Let me tell you a secret.

37
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:29.566
In fact, I know that you accompanied the city through the slump

38
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:33.066
But I was the one walking around town.

39
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.900
After all, it sounds so good

40
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.400
How can it belong to a dead man like you?
