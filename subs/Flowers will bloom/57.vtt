1
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.766
I go to run errands, I'm unreliable, I never answer the phone

2
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:12.766
OK

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.266
Sounds urgent.

4
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.666
What are you doing?

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.066
Looking like you have done something wrong

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.500
How did I get it?

7
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.600
I'm just here to touch up my makeup backstage.

8
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.233
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.166
The awards are coming soon.

10
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.566
I'm here to change clothes

11
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.366
This was Ebert's custom, after all.

12
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.266
Have to wear a different dress and follow the procedure

13
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.533
Otherwise, it will be abandoned by fashion brands

14
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.766
You won't be able to wear a limited edition haute couture in the future

15
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.266
Just because you want to win the award

16
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.166
You don't have any work.

17
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.133
Just an anonymous amateur

18
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.733
Do you take the head to receive the award?

19
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.900
I'm the one who's going to change clothes to receive the award

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.100
You hurry out

21
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.633
What are you doing, get out and let me go

22
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.400
Wait, I'll let you wear it.

23
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.900
What a pity!

24
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Such a beautiful dress

25
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.266
No, there's a fire inside
