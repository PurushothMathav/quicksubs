1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.066
You've never sung in front of me before

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.366
Mr. Lu privately

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.300
Never heard him sing

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.166
This

5
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.666
Mr. Lu's favorite is Jiang Yongrou's singing

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.100
Is he lip-synching Mr. Lu the clearest?

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.700
Now I kind of believe it.

8
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.500
He must have asked me to lip-synch

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.666
How did he make it?

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.366
My throat hurts, you know that

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.800
The reason why I don't open my voice in front of the public

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.866
Just to protect my throat

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.633
Give my fans an explanation

14
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.433
I didn't let you keep singing

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.033
Can you sing a little bit?

16
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.100
idiom

17
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.733
Are you really going to do this for this unknown woman?

18
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.866
Do you doubt me?

19
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.700
I sang this song to prove myself

20
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.366
But there is also a gap between our feelings

21
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.866
Is this really what you want?

22
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.900
Can't prove yourself

23
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.066
Start playing the relationship card

24
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.633
What are you?

25
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:54.133
Why do you question me? I didn't sing these songs.

26
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.466
Who else could have sung it?

27
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.733
Why are you so sure that your girlfriend is looking for a p field?

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.066
Do you have any evidence?

29
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.466
Still know something

30
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.300
Just open the rain

31
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.966
You'll know if what I'm talking about is really Yurou

32
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.300
sing
