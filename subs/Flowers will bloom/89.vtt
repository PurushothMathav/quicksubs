00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.900
How long will it take for him to end up with you?

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.900
It will take about half an hour.

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.533
If he knew you were coming to pick him up in person

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.500
Also bring some gifts

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.700
He will be very happy

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.233
Hey, who gave you so many gifts?

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.300
What about your assistant?

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.466
Why didn't he give it to you?

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.666
There is no way for fans to give such a heavy thing.

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.266
How did you take it alone?

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.466
Just take this

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.700
This is my gift to you.

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.033
See if you like it or not.

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.400
You are giving me a luxury car

15
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.733
My gift

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.633
It should be worth more than what your fans give away.

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.233
From this evening

18
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.366
But the value of the gift

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.033
It should be up to the convergent to have the final say

20
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.266
In my eyes, your luxury car is nothing

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.700
But fan letters are worthless
