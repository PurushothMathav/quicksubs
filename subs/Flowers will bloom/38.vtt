00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.266
How is that possible?

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.000
Is there a problem with this?

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.333
It must be a broken machine.

4
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.233
I'll change the machine.

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.633
Could it be that there is a problem with the card?

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.500
Why don't we change the card?

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.166
Yurou, this dress is the treasure of their town store.

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.633
How about tens of millions?

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.266
How is that possible?

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.366
Can you afford a big star?

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.766
What happened to tens of millions

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.400
I really think I can't afford it.

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.033
Brush this

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.766
It worked.

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.033
The bank refused.

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.666
Are you dumping me?

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.400
What are you crazy about spending more than 1,000?

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.166
I want to buy a dress for the Egut Awards

19
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.466
Because of the promotion

20
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.200
You are now being compensated by major brands.

21
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.066
The money made has already been put into it

22
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.666
Where can I find so much money to buy a skirt?

23
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.266
Let Mr. Lu send you a set at a high price.

24
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.700
How did you earn the money? It's all claimed.

25
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.266
Wouldn't all these years have been in vain?

26
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.500
You shut up because of you

27
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.966
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have made a claim.
