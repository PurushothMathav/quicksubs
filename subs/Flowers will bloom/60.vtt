00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.733
Many of you in my audience have already guessed it.

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.333
Who is this mysterious figure?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.433
We'll find out soon

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.566
Ah, can't it really be that Witt?

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.866
But doesn't he never show up?

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:15.066
I made an exception this time. I don't know if Witt is really here.

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.733
That's got to be front page.

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.766
The entire entertainment industry will be shocked.

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.400
Witt never appears in public

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.266
He is a very powerful and

11
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.400
Low key musician

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.500
Or rather an artist

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.433
Since he never participated in Albert

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.333
That proves he's not committed to it

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.933
So this award is definitely not his.

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.433
Miss Jiang is so funny

17
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.200
If you don't see the organizer's hand card with your own eyes

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
I really can't believe it either.

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.433
Everyone in the circle wants to see the real Witt

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.233
Really come to the scene

21
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.033
That's impossible.

22
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.400
Today is mine

23
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.733
I'm not going to let this Witt steal my thunder

24
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.466
Down sit down

25
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.533
Here we go.

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.266
Witt, who has won 5 Albert Awards from the Disabled Persons' Federation

27
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.033
Accept the award for the first time
