00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.966
成宇你不签字

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.433
那我算什么

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.566
陈太太的事是我对荞麦说了重话

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.100
他才离家出走的

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.800
这些是我亏欠了他

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.500
可他荞

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.766
麦都已经让人把离婚协议送来了

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.233
你为什么不签字啊

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:20.300
我说过我要等乔家度过了飞机

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.000
这是我的承诺

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.233
那你对我的承诺呢

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.500
你说过你会娶我的

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
那荞麦呢

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.700
我的承诺每一件都做到了

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.466
可是你给我的承诺

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.900
你为什么连找荞

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.700
麦提倡这件事都不告诉我

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.000
那是因为你一开始喜欢我的声音

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.466
喜欢听我唱歌

20
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.600
我怕我跟你说了我嗓子坏了

21
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.066
不喜欢我了

22
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.900
那荞麦你为什么不告诉我

23
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.066
他给你做了这么多年的品尝

24
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.300
是荞麦不让我跟你说

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000
他要给他爸爸还债

26
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:56.600
所以

27
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.600
我只是给他提供一个赚钱的工作

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.433
机会

29
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.466
真能撒谎呀

30
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:05.566
姜羽绒你这么说你不觉得心虚吗

31
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.766
我不知道你到底是哪来的奇怪女人

32
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.533
还有我跟荞麦的事

33
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.200
轮得到你多嘴吗你敢这么说

34
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.800
你就不怕我把你最大的秘密

35
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.066
都说出来吗

36
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.266
姜玉荣

37
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.100
你还有什么事情瞒着我呀

38
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.966
Sung Woo, you don't sign

39
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.433
Then what am I?

40
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.566
The thing about Mrs. Chen is that I said something hard about buckwheat

41
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.100
He just ran away from home

42
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.800
This is what I owe him

43
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.500
Kota buckwheat

44
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.766
Mai Du has had someone send the divorce agreement

45
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.233
Why don't you sign it?

46
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:20.300
I said I was going to wait until the Joes got through the plane

47
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.000
This is my promise.

48
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.233
What about your promise to me?

49
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.500
You said you would marry me

50
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
What about buckwheat?

51
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.700
I have fulfilled every promise I made.

52
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.466
But the promise you made to me

53
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.900
Why are you even looking for buckwheat?

54
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.700
Mai advocated not telling me about it

55
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.000
That's because you liked my voice at first

56
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.466
Like to hear me sing

57
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.600
I'm afraid I told you my throat was broken

58
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.066
Don't like me anymore

59
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.900
Why didn't you tell me about the buckwheat?

60
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.066
He has been making you tastings for so many years

61
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.300
It's buckwheat that won't let me tell you

62
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000
He has to pay off his father's debt.

63
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:56.600
So

64
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.600
I just offered him a lucrative job

65
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.433
opportunity

66
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.466
You can lie

67
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:05.566
Ginger down, don't you feel guilty when you say that?

68
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.766
I don't know where you are from, strange woman

69
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.533
And about me and buckwheat

70
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.200
Is it your turn to talk too much? Dare you say that?

71
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.800
Are you not afraid that I will tell your biggest secret?

72
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.066
Say it all?

73
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.266
Jiang Yurong

74
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.100
What else are you hiding from me?
