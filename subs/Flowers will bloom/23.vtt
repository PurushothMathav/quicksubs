00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.266
I'm sorry, Cheng Yu

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:05.266
I am looking for him to advocate, and I also have difficulties

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.366
have difficulties

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.266
What reason did you have to lie to me for so long?

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.266
I can't believe it.

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.500
Sauce cattle are not only seeking advice

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.266
I'm still looking for Mrs. Lu

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.666
Mrs. Lu, I have indeed seen this

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.566
Indeed, it is fat and ugly.

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.600
But it was miserable.

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.700
All been

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.566
Husband's mistress was bullied to the head

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.100
You said a good daughter of the Qiao family

14
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.466
I actually went to do a split for my husband's lover

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.666
I feel sorry for him

16
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.166
Back then, Mr. Lu married Mrs. Lu

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.400
It seems that Mrs. Lu's father was coerced

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.900
Do you think this man wants to marry a fat woman as his daughter-in-law?

19
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.166
Let me make a statement

20
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.300
I am indeed in the business with buckwheat

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.900
But we are your will

22
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.833
There is no coercion

23
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:56.700
idiom

24
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.533
Why are you speaking for buckwheat?

25
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.766
How do you make people see you like this?

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.766
It's true.

27
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.900
I don't need to lie

28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.066
You don't like buckwheat at all

29
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.000
If they hadn't taken advantage of the danger

30
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.733
How could you possibly marry such an ugly fat woman?

31
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.533
That's enough!

32
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.066
I've told you many times

33
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.600
Buckwheat and I are originally a business

34
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.166
mutual benefit

35
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.700
It has nothing to do with what he looks like

36
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.766
Lu Chenyu, stop pretending

37
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.566
Sanctimonious

38
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.166
In fact, you are also very sick of buckwheat in your heart

39
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.666
I thought he was ugly and fat

40
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.433
I don't deserve to be your wife at all, do I?
