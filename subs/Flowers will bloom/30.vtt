00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.433
Even so

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.200
You shouldn't have kept it from me

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.500
Buckwheat has been approving for you for so many years

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.166
And you never told him?

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.166
I have a business relationship with him

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.266
But in the end

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.900
Or do I owe him?

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.366
Are you going to compensate him?

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.900
Don't I dare to compensate

10
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.466
That's not what I meant.

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.266
Cheng Yu

12
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.700
I will also make up for the buckwheat well.

13
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.766
Don't abandon me, okay?

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.700
Even if my throat is broken now

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.300
I will also try my best

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.600
Sing a lullaby for you

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.233
That lullaby

18
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.866
Accompanied me through the darkest moment of my life

19
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:47.266
How could I be willing to leave you, fool?

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.300
Thank you Cheng Yu

21
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.566
Let go of me!

22
00:00:58.933 --> 00:00:59.933
Who are you?

23
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.066
What to do?

24
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.766
Oops, you're back.

25
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:03.800
I remember.

26
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.500
There's not only one ugly and

27
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.966
Does the fat woman live here?

28
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.200
How are you

29
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.833
The person you are looking for is buckwheat, right?

30
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.066
How do you know him?

31
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.066
Since I didn't find him

32
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.700
Then I'll recruit you

33
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.500
otherwise

34
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.900
I have never seen a woman as beautiful as you

35
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.700
Or what?
