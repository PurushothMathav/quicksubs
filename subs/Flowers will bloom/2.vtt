00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.033
Let go of me!

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.266
Wheat, let him go

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.366
Do you want so many people to see the effect?

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.800
Cheng Yu takes care of him

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.633
He's so embarrassing

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.433
Wheat break up

7
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.766
Cheng Yu I

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.566
He was the one who spoke badly first

9
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.366
little sister

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.600
Don't fool around, you go back first

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.966
This is Mrs. Deer.

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.066
Buckwheat is so fat and ugly

13
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.866
I heard that I have been entangled in my stomach

14
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.666
He also followed the down to the personal concert

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.833
What? Mrs. Deer?

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:35.933
Like a hulk

17
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:36.733
That is.

18
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.600
Back then, it was his parents who forced Mr. Lu to go

19
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.300
Now it's karma, bankruptcy.

20
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.133
He still has the face to see Mr. Lu

21
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.600
Don't you think so?

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.766
Yeah, go back, hurry up

23
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.700
Hurry up and leave. It's scary to look like this.

24
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.700
Hurry up and go

25
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.133
Go hurry up

26
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.966
Go, stinky starling

27
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.600
Too stupid to give it to you.

28
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:29.166
When did you divorce buckwheat?
