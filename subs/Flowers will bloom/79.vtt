00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.400
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.033
Don't go

3
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.433
Is it in the eyes of Mr. Lu?

4
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.966
Not being able to sleep turned out to be a worse thing than death

5
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:17.800
Yes!

6
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.066
In the countless nights I broke down and couldn't sleep

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.466
It was that lullaby that accompanied me to sleep

8
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.200
Then why don't you listen to lullabies?

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.866
Because I did something wrong.

10
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.400
I don't deserve to listen to him anymore

11
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.966
So now I even listen to the recording

12
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.433
I can't sleep either.

13
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.833
My subconscious told me

14
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.700
I don't deserve it.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.500
Then why did you call me here?

16
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.566
I'm not a wallboard

17
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.900
I am Witt

18
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.766
Then you know Joe so well

19
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.100
You should be able to sing his songs

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.766
You want me to sing you a lullaby?

21
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.666
Is that okay?

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.633
I am not buckwheat

23
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.900
What I sing may not work for you

24
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.666
My voice has changed

25
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.500
Even if I sing that lullaby again

26
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.266
It shouldn't work either.

27
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.600
Can you?

28
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.466
Sing it to me again

29
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.566
Even the last time

30
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.433
Go to sleep go to sleep

31
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:38.766
Lu Changyu, you miss buckwheat now

32
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.300
Or are you more concerned about the stomach pain in front of you?

33
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.766
Is it for you

34
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.466
Even my lullaby can be replaced
