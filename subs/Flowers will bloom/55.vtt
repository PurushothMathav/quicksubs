1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.300
Cheng Yu, stay away from him

2
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.900
These two invitations are different.

3
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000
Everyone's invitations have names on them

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.433
Please explain why yours doesn't have it.

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.366
Because I'm a special guest.

6
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.900
Arguing, I think you faked it at all

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.800
How can this invitation be faked?

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.066
true or false?

9
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.200
Blind, such a beautiful face

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.766
What's the difference between this and rubbing the red carpet with a dead face?

11
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.000
Why aren't you wearing it?

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.366
The day the master revealed the secret

13
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.800
A white dress is specially tailored for you

14
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.366
That's the one you traded for with a fake identity

15
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.200
Will it be revealed and the identity will be found out?

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.866
So you can only change one.

17
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.866
It's a limited edition haute couture

18
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.266
Of course, it will be changed when the awards are presented later.
