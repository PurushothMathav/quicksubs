Hello, Miss Jiang.

2
00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.066
Do you have confidence in this Albert Award?

3
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.933
It's not been months since the last controversy was advocated

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.000
You've been nominated for the Albert Award for Best Performance

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.566
May I ask if Miss Jiang thinks this is an affirmation for you?

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.266
Is it sarcasm?

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.366
Which newspaper are you from?

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.066
Come to work without training?

9
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Miss Jiang.

10
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.466
Well, he's new here and doesn't know the rules.

11
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.666
You see, you have gone through such a big storm this time

12
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.266
You can still nominate for this award

13
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.166
It means that you are still very popular with the audience.

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.733
Thank you for your support.

15
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.700
I will try my best to produce excellent work

16
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.000
Return everyone's joy

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.966
Isn't it the richest man in Shanghai City?

18
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.333
What's there to be angry about?

19
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.900
She was married.

20
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.000
People are so powerful

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.833
What can you do with a top gifter?

22
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400
The cover singing scandal has caused a lot of controversy

23
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.566
He's still nominated for Best Performer.

24
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.866
I'll tell you what.

25
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.133
Don't offend him

26
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.866
Otherwise, I don't know how I died

27
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.166
Idiom sit

28
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.866
Sorry, there's already someone here.

29
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.400
Your seat is in the second row
