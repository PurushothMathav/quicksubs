1
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.533
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.900
If you sit here

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.866
Miss Witt can only sit in the second row

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.966
This definitely won't work

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.200
Why not?

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.666
He won an award.

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.166
Then let him sit in the second row and feel wronged by him

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.766
If you don't feel wronged

9
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.600
Why don't you go to the second row yourself?

10
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:22.566
Do you want to make me the laughing stock of everyone?

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.533
If Mr. Lu is reluctant

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.000
Why don't you replace Jiang Yurou and go to the second row yourself?

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.533
What is Cheng Yu's identity?

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.066
How could he sit in the second row?

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.300
Don't think you can go so far if you're Witt

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.366
That's enough!

17
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.366
If you want to sit here, you sit here

18
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.266
I'll go to the back

19
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:45.933
idiom

20
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.033
Witt, what do I do?

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.966
This is not where you should sit

22
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.600
Sit in the back

23
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.566
I'm so sorry, Miss Jiang.

24
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.566
You have delayed the next process.

25
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.233
Besides, you have to receive an award later.

26
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.266
You'd better sit down first
