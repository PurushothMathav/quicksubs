1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.600
Aren't you going to divorce him?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.300
Where is he and what does it matter to you?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.200
If he has been advocating for the universe

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.100
Why didn't you tell me?

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.266
knowingly ask

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.766
You treat him so poorly

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.166
Why did he tell you?

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.666
How dare he tell you?

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.200
Sung Woo, don't trust him

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200
He was sent by the right family to frame me

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.966
Trying to destroy my career

12
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.500
Security, get him out of here. Okay?

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.933
In my phone

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.300
It's all videos that buckwheat advocates for you in the background.

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.366
Here are some more.

16
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.733
It's all written for you by buckwheat

17
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.200
Those famous manuscripts

18
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.133
Jiang Yuluo's basic masterpiece

19
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.533
Didn't he write it all himself?

20
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.100
Even this is fake

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.533
This is too much.

22
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.633
Ah, that's too much.

23
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.700
Ginger down, you can ask buckwheat to sing for you.

24
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.833
Write a song for you

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.766
While sending it to his husband

26
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.900
You are too at ease for some reason, I gave the money
