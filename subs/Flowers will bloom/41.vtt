00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.700
Idiom you promised me

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.566
You will do it, right?

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.966
I knew it!

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.500
You are the best to me

5
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.000
What I just said still counts

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.100
As long as you tell me

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.833
Buckwheat vegetables everything in this store

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.766
Take your pick.

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.600
I want that dress just now

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.800
No, that skirt just now

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.466
It's what I'm going to wear to the Albert Awards

12
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.266
It's just a nomination.

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.200
I feel like I'm going to win

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
With my qualifications and abilities

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.133
Among those nominated

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.066
There are a few that can compare to me

17
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.866
How can someone who is looking for an advocate be so confident?

18
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.166
It won't be Lu Chengyu

19
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.700
It should be fixed for you.

20
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.433
These things have nothing to do with you

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.066
You tell me where the buckwheat is

22
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.266
You just said

23
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.933
I can pick out everything in this store

24
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.466
Yeah that's good

25
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.700
I want everything in this store
