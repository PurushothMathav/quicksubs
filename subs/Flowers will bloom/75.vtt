1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.966
Usually not.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600
But Lu Chengyu is not an ordinary man

3
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.933
You have known Lu Chengyu for so many years

4
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.500
You know what kind of person he is best

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.500
You have been married for so long

6
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.100
The time you left Mrs. Chen

7
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.100
Did he ever dislike your appearance?

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.733
He has because others are beautiful

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.300
And Gao glanced at them?

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.400
He is kind to Jiang Yurou

11
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.266
That's also because Jiang Yurou falsely claimed your identity

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.200
buy and sell

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.400
Dad believes in your vision

14
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.400
otherwise

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.700
I will not agree to your marriage with Lu Chengyu either

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.066
If he's really that bad

17
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.100
Will you like him for so many years?

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.433
Misunderstood right

19
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.800
But I still don't want to forgive him.

20
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.366
Dad didn't say he wants you to forgive him

21
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.966
I just want to watch you suffer

22
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.800
You know, after all, he also hurt

23
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.433
If you want a divorce

24
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.166
Dad will definitely support you.

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.900
Thank you dad and grandma

26
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100
Do what you want.

27
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.900
In fact, you have the same personality as your mother

28
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.433
They refuse to admit defeat

29
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.100
Dad, you said

30
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.300
My mom, would she still want to see me?

31
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.200
You are his only daughter

32
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.966
How could he not want to see you?

33
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.166
But I heard he has a new family.

34
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.366
What does it matter?

35
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.766
You secretly go to see him

36
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.500
He has an International Chamber of Commerce in a few days.

37
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.666
He doesn't know what you say yet.

38
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.666
You don't tell him who you are

39
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.800
Test his attitude towards you

40
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.366
I know.

41
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.100
OK

42
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.266
There you go.
