00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.500
Whose clothes are on fire?

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.200
I don't know what low-end material it tastes really good.

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.566
It shouldn't be able to wear it if it's burned like this, right?

4
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.833
What's going on?

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.300
Why is there smoke in there?

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.966
It's nothing, just someone's dress burned

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.800
It's this woman again

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.200
What's wrong with her?

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.400
I guess it's bad feng shui

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.433
The entertainment industry still has to believe in order

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.133
Everyone stay away from her

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.633
This dress burned her waiting for me to wear what

13
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.600
It can't be that she has no clothes to change, right?

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.766
The clothes are already like this.

15
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.266
You don't have to stay here anymore

16
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.666
I'll find someone to take you back

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.700
roll

18
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.900
I told you to go away, didn't you hear?

19
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.600
Why do I look at him?

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.300
You will feel that you see buckwheat.
