00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.666
I'm not being sarcastic.

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.200
You still want to deny

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.800
You've all seen it.

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.666
Ah, that's right.

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.266
He did mock down.

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.966
He ironically couldn't afford down.

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.500
Mr. Lu, you must be the master of the down!

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.700
Miss Jiang is right

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.800
This woman is indeed ironic that she cannot afford it

10
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
I actually couldn't afford it.

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.833
This kid tried for nothing

12
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.000
You see everyone heard

13
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.366
What else do you have to say?

14
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.666
I'm not being sarcastic.

15
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.466
I'm just being honest, you really can't afford it.

16
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.766
Really? You?

17
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.233
idiom

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.666
Go brush it, okay, Mr. Lu

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.366
As long as you tell me buckwheat

20
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.400
I can still pay for you.

21
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.700
There are tens of millions of skirts here.

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.233
Are you really going to pay for me?

23
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.966
You are in such a hurry to find buckwheat

24
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.500
Of course. She's my wife.

25
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.900
I owe him an apology.

26
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.100
I know you found buckwheat to make up for him

27
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.933
Divorce him later

28
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.800
Will you marry me?
