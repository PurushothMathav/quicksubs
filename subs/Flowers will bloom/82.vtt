1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.533
He just admitted it.

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.800
Famous Witt

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.633
Always using other people's work

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.600
Who is that buckwheat person?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.700
So talented

6
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.333
Hey, I don't know.

7
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.400
There was a car accident some time ago, and now the life and death are unknown.

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.600
Did you hear the idiom?

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.733
So he confessed.

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:21.600
So what do you want to say so what?

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.866
Why is that?

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.533
Why is it also the work of Maoling buckwheat?

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.266
I was despised by thousands of people

14
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.366
He can get your liking.

15
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.233
Why isn't that fair?

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.500
Come on, drag this lunatic out of here

17
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.166
I don't want Qi Zong

18
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.566
He didn't just own Witt's work

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.966
He also had an affair with Boss Qiao

20
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.966
What nonsense are you talking about?

21
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.300
You have to believe me.

22
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.866
What I said is true.

23
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.866
He is having an affair with Buckwheat's father

24
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.000
Otherwise, why does he live at Qiao's house every day?

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.233
Because I'm his dad.

26
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.400
Witt in your mouth

27
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.233
It's my daughter buckwheat

28
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.666
That's impossible.

29
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.033
I thought he couldn't be buckwheat

30
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.800
Buckwheat is obviously a 100kg fat man

31
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.266
How could he have become like this?
