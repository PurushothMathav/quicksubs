00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.466
You are talking nonsense. You don't know him at all.

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.666
You are a liar

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.433
What are you so excited about?

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.866
guilty

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.433
Does he know who is promoting meat to me?

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.066
So what's going on?

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.966
The idiom is not I don't want him to show up

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.266
It's because he thinks he's so ugly

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.633
I don't want the public to see him ugly

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.766
So?

11
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:24.000
You've been looking for Tishang for so many years, it's still for his own good

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.133
Of course, if it weren't for me

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.266
How does he make money?

14
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.033
But he is a legitimate Mrs. Lu

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.700
It's the daughter of the Qiao family again

16
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.133
How could there be a shortage of money?

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.066
The Qiao family is bankrupt and still the daughter of the Qiao family

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.533
He sang for me with buckwheat.

19
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.333
Just to pay off his father's debt

20
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.400
Pardon me?

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.666
Buckwheat is recommended for you.

22
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.700
Not a big idiom

23
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.166
What did I just instruct?

24
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.500
The instructions said it was a leak.

25
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.333
Jiang Yurou, let me ask you again

26
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.633
Is it buckwheat that I am advocating for you?
