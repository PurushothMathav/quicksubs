00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.066
Idiom buckwheat he didn't mean to

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.366
How many times have I told him?

3
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.733
Let him embarrass me

4
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.233
He also bullied Mrs. Chen

5
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.500
You know.

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.000
How much effort did I put into this project?

7
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.833
But what can you do with him?

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.166
After all, he is still your wife

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.500
I should have known today

10
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.300
I should have divorced him a long time ago

11
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.766
Zhang Yu

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.300
But is that true?

13
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.133
Do you really want to divorce me?

14
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.166
The last thing I ever did in my life

15
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.300
Is to marry you

16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.400
You are just like those people out there

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.300
Think I'm an ugly and fat pig

18
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.066
Right?

19
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.466
You know what those people outside say about you

20
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.600
You are indeed ugly and ugly

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.166
But I said I can tolerate you looking like a pig.

22
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.833
I can't accept that your brain is also a pig.

23
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.900
Oh, I see.

24
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.366
Wu Chengyu, do you hate me so much?

25
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.466
Slowly, what's the matter with that kid Lu Chengyu?

26
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.900
Did he bully you?

27
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.100
The divorce papers have been sent home

28
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.633
I can tolerate your appearance.

29
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:36.833
I can't accept that your brain TV deskmate is ugly and

30
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.600
Stupid Mr. Lu must regret marrying you

31
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.266
Do it wrong in this life

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.200
Is to marry you
