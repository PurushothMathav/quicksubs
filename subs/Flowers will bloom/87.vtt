00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.900
Mm, that tastes pretty good. Mm-hmm.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.866
Everything seems to be delicious today

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.700
Delicious, delicious, you can eat more

4
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:13.000
Everything you ordered today is your favorite, daughter.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.766
Who is the chef today?

6
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.100
Let us get to know each other

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.600
I remember the previous chef cooking

8
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.833
It doesn't taste good

9
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.600
Dinner tonight

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.233
Are you satisfied?

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.366
How is it you?

12
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.600
Why are you here?

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.100
Didn't our parents say they wanted to meet today's chef?

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.800
What about this table?

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.100
I did it all.

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.666
Do you like it?

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.900
If you like it

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.833
I can make it for you every day.

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.366
Then I'm divorced, so don't say that

20
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.033
I will not agree to a divorce

21
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.666
It's not up to you to get a divorce or not

22
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.266
As long as Maimai agrees

23
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.833
It's up to you, I really don't want a divorce

24
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.633
But I also want to respect Maimai's decision

25
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.066
So I will prove it with my actions

26
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.100
How important is he to me?

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.700
You are now Sun Wukong

28
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.966
What did you do before?

29
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.633
Do you think it's just a few words?

30
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.700
I can give my daughter back to you

31
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.200
You were dreaming.
