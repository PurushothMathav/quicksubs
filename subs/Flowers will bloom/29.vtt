00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.266
You're right actually.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.900
I don't care enough about him

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.866
Anyway, you are just a business marriage

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.633
No emotional foundation

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.066
You don't like him either

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.866
Why didn't his dad tell me he owed money?

7
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.166
What the hell do you want to do to make money?

8
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.366
I don't know.

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.700
Probably because I don't want to cause you trouble.

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.166
There's no trouble between me and him

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.233
The Qiao family helped me before, and I will definitely help him too

12
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.300
Because he not only took this marriage

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.800
For commercial reasons

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.666
He likes you.

15
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.700
Because I like it.

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.500
So I dare not bother

17
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.200
Wait until you sign the divorce agreement

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.633
Contact again.

19
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.300
I still say that

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.700
If you want a divorce

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.833
Let him talk to me himself

22
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:02.966
Cheng Yu

23
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.800
What's wrong with me?

24
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.200
The doctor said you're fine

25
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.866
Are you still mad at me?

26
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.866
Cheng Yu, I just don't want to lose you

27
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.400
So I lied

28
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.433
What you said before

29
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.566
You said you would marry me after you took over Lu Enterprises

30
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.300
But you married buckwheat.

31
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.233
I'm really sorry.
