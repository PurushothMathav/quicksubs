00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:07.966
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.066
I need to ask you something.

3
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.600
If he asks me

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.700
Why have you been living in a buckwheat clip?

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.500
What reason should I think of?

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.200
I know buckwheat doesn't want to pick me up

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.033
I don't want to force him either

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.500
But please help me tell him I was wrong

9
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.500
Ok, I'll tell him.

10
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.300
Why did you ask me out?

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.500
You help me tell stir

12
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.066
No matter what he looks like

13
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.133
In my eyes

14
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.500
He is the one who will only give it to me.

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.066
Little girl singing a lullaby

16
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.900
It has nothing to do with his weight

17
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.233
You help me tell Joe Mei

18
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.800
The person I love has always been him

19
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.400
I will ask for his forgiveness

20
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.400
No matter how long it takes

21
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.900
Why are you going

22
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.166
Just a few months

23
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.466
You become what you are now

24
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.300
You must have suffered a lot.

25
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.166
Mr. Lu, after our investigation

26
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.066
Witt is most likely the wife

27
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.400
These were taken after my wife's car accident
