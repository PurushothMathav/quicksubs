00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.166
Miss

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.566
This dress suits you very well. Would you like to try it on?

3
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.100
Give me that one

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.533
You have a good eye.

5
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.266
That's the treasure of our town store

6
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.400
Down I didn't expect you to nominate grandma stomp your feet

7
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.666
This time we have to buy some clothes well.

8
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.433
The sun will be shining

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.600
What do you mean you didn't expect?

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.200
Do you think I can't get Albert to speak?

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.400
That's not what I meant.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.766
If you can't speak, don't say it

13
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.500
Hello, you are Miss Jiang.

14
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.133
Miss Jiang, I like listening to your songs very much.

15
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.266
Are you being sarcastic? I'm not.

16
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.500
Yurou has been replaced recently because she was dismantled.

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.900
So maybe a little bit emotionally

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.966
I understand.

19
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.466
But recently, Miss Jia also nominated Albert

20
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.600
Best in Show?

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.766
Hope he gets an award.

22
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.400
Do you have this skirt in white?

23
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.566
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

24
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.566
There is only one piece of this white style.

25
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.966
It's another lady trying it on

26
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.566
Do you know who I am?

27
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.300
Let him take it off and give it to me right away
