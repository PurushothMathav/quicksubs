00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.100
Idiom leave him alone

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.066
He should never have been at this invitation

3
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.033
It may be obtained by what means

10

I believe those who follow us Albert know

13
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:43.800
These few years

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.733
