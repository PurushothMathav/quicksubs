00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.900
You are a person who has to fake invitations

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.266
Still delusional about winning

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.366
Do you know

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.466
This Albert

5
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.166
It is the most valuable music award in Asia

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.933
What kind of pheasant award do you think it is?

7
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.900
If you think this invitation is still fake

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.966
Just ask the corresponding personnel to check it.

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.500
You're still struggling here

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.866
Even I can see that this invitation is not right

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.900
Can't the staff see it?

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.766
Miss Jiang's invitation letter is indeed genuine

13
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.966
That's impossible.

14
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.200
His invitation doesn't even have a name

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.466
Must be fake

16
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.533
Sorry, Miss Jiang.

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.933
The organizers have rules

18
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.200
Each invitation letter has an anti-counterfeiting code on it.

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.300
As long as it is verified

20
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.500
Then it's absolutely true

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.633
There is no forgery.

22
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.866
Is this still reversed?

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.500
This ginger down

24
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.666
Didn't you just say it was forged?

25
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.800
Why don't you speak now, Miss Jiang?

26
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.433
Why don't you speak?

27
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.766
There's something wrong with this.

28
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.033
It's just that it hasn't been investigated for the time being.

29
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.800
Just wait.

30
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.366
Sooner or later you will be exposed
