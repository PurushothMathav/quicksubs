00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.500
If you have a clear conscience

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.900
Afraid of being reported by me

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.366
Don't be too complacent

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.700
Can you come here for a while?

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.400
I'm in trouble.

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.133
Just wait.

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.466
The idiom is coming soon

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.866
Do you really think I can't afford it?

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.000
When the idiom comes, he can buy me the whole sea city

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.500
Qiuyu, you are here.

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.900
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.633
Come to buy clothes?

13
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.900
That night, I waited for him at Buckwheat's all night.

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.900
He never showed up.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.166
Where did he go?

16
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.266
Hey, who is that woman down?

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.166
Why does Cheng always seem to be very familiar with him?

18
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.300
What do you know?

19
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.033
Success you don't know him at all

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.466
I want to buy that white dress

21
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.766
Enter the Albert Award

22
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.500
But that lady, she mocked me and said she couldn't afford it.
