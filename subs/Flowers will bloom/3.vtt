00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.000
The Qiao family is now in trouble

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.166
Not a mistake

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.200
But the Qiao family encountered difficulties

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.100
Why should you help him?

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.066
Back then, the Lu family and the Qiao family got married

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.133
This is a state of mutual benefit and win-win.

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.800
Although I have no feelings for him

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.566
But he didn't do anything wrong.

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.566
I will not cross the river and demolish the bridge.

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:20.100
Divorce is when the Qiao family gets through the crisis

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.033
What's up?

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.766
Live fish

13
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.766
Look at him.

14
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.533
Squeezed me

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.633
I've been very careful

16
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.400
Sorry for being too fat.

17
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.666
Forget it, go home

18
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.033
Switch that cart next time

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.400
idiom

20
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.000
When will you accept me?

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.366
You said you would marry me

22
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.100
I haven't divorced him yet.

23
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.666
Accepting now is bad for your reputation.

24
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.533
It turned out that it was just to prevent Jiang Yurou from being infamed

25
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.666
I thought it had been so many years

26
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.100
He also has a little affection for me

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.600
Is it true that fat people don't deserve to be loved?

28
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.966
But I've been waiting for you for years

29
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.733
I know I haven't had your singing with me all these years

30
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.400
I may not be able to live long ago

31
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.766
We wait for the Qiao family to get through the crisis this time

32
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.566
I will officially file for divorce from him

33
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.500
Then last year it was fair and square

34
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.566
Sung Woo, I will tonight

35
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.466
Can I spend the night here?

36
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.566
No, that's the bottom line.

37
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.433
I don't want you to be a third party.

38
00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:53.633
Never let Cheng Woo know

39
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:56.500
The woman who accompanied him through the slump was not me
