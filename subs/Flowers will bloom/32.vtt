00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.433
Buckwheat

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.233
Ouch uncle

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.600
Are you not wearing glasses?

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.200
I'm a friend of buckwheat. I'm looking for buckwheat.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.400
Is buckwheat at home?

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.066
Oh, the buckwheat hasn't come back yet.

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.500
Uh, can you come in?

8
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.200
Wait, what's wrong?

9
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.766
Mr. Lu, are you okay?

10
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.566
Nothing much happened.

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.833
Remember to take the medicine

12
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.966
It's nothing, I'll go in first

13
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:36.766
And so forth.

14
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.166
What happened again?

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.866
When will the buckwheat be back?

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.900
Lu Chengyun

17
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.233
If you want to divorce our Mai Mai

18
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.400
Just let the assistant speak

19
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.666
He doesn't want to see you!

20
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.700
I quarreled with buckwheat and said something heavy

21
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.566
But it was just a passing fad

22
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.333
I want to apologize to him before we talk about the divorce

23
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.233
Do you think apologizing will work?

24
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.866
Ah, my daughter's heart is broken by you

25
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.400
You think you can make up for it by apologizing

26
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.000
Uncle, don't tell him so much.

27
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.100
Otherwise, do you think there are more buckwheat?

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.100
Dad?

29
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.600
Who is this woman?

30
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.900
What does he have to do with buckwheat?
