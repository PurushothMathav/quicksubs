00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.466
That's not what I meant.

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.666
What do you mean?

3
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.500
I just want to find buckwheat quickly

4
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.966
I don't want to waste time on such trifles

5
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:10.833
Although I didn't let Lin Yue bet with him

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.000
But Lin Yue is fighting for me after all

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.966
Can you not have time to care about his strangers?

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.633
Sorry I just want to find buckwheat quickly

9
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.300
Do you really want to meet him?

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.133
I said as long as you tell me about the buckwheat project

11
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.066
Let me see you

12
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.166
I can buy this store and give it to you.

13
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.666
Since you are so sincere

14
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.066
Then I'll pass it on for you.

15
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.400
Wrap this skirt for me

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.733
Who is it?

17
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.300
Why are you so related to buckwheat?

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.766
It also allows designers to reveal secrets

19
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.933
Prepare all kinds of things for your parents, it doesn't matter who I am

20
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:51.533
Here's the thing.

21
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.366
Do you know who the people around you are?

22
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.966
What do you want to say, just say it

23
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.233
I don't like playing dumb

24
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.800
Hello, your stuff.

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.433
You'll be meeting buckwheat soon.

26
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:11.866
idiom

27
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.100
What should I do?
