00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:01.866
down

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.966
Who has been advocating with you all these years?

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:07.033
Just someone with a voice like mine

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.400
Leave him alone.

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.166
Anyway.

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.266
Your fans love his voice

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.800
You should put him in front of the public video

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
Let them decide whether to continue liking him or not

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.633
He is after my vocal cords were damaged

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.866
Find an advocate

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.033
He was imitating my voice.

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.400
What it boils down to is this.

13
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.866
It's just an advocacy tool.

14
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.933
The things advocated can still be fooled

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.166
If found

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.566
The woman who accompanied Chengyu through the valley was not me

17
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.433
No, buckwheat must die

18
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.500
Who is that advocate?

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.366
Why don't you want everyone to see

20
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.200
That's because he sounds like me.

21
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.200
I'm afraid everyone won't like me after knowing him

22
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.933
It's the listener's choice.

23
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.766
If he had a precious voice like you

24
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.266
I don't think you should act cute

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.300
He doesn't want to show up.

26
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.200
Why? Because he's ugly.

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.966
Yeah, because he was ugly.

28
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:05.033
So he doesn't want to be exposed to the public

29
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.900
That's why he's an advocate for me.

30
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.400
And he was right.

31
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.900
This woman advocated by Jiang Yurou

32
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.133
Yes, it's really ugly.

33
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.000
No, how do you know you know him?
