00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.100
Manman

2
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.866
Are you thinking of him again?

3
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.300
I'm not thinking about him.

4
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.866
I didn't say who he was.

5
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.000
You don't want to

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.666
What about you?

7
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.766
In fact, my mother doesn't want you to be better

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.300
But at the end of the day

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.866
Mom wants you to come over the most

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.066
Thank you, Mom. I divorced your dad a few years ago

11
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.000
I already feel sorry for you.

12
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.900
All these years, I was too busy with my career to ignore me

13
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.900
Mom is really ashamed

14
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.800
Don't say that.

15
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.566
It's like following me slowly, I treated him to death

16
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.000
You have the nerve to say

17
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.300
I only know now that he used to go bankrupt

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.566
How dare you let my dear daughter?

19
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.833
Secretly sing for someone else and pay him back

20
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.766
You said I haven't gone yet, right?

21
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.933
Oh, I really want to know.

22
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.233
Such a big hole

23
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.666
Billions in debt

24
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.400
How did you pay it back in such a short time?

25
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.600
Thanks to Mrs. Chen

26
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.333
If Mrs. Chen hadn't endorsed me

27
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.733
Guarantee me again

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.800
I can't pay off my debt that quickly.

29
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.200
Make a comeback

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.500
madam

31
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.666
Although our previous meeting had some unpleasantness

32
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.533
But this time I really want to thank you.

33
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.100
Helping my dad get through this difficult time

34
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.166
I want to toast you

35
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:24.766
You don't need to thank me.

36
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.666
It was Lu Yu who begged in front of me

37
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.300
That's why I'm willing to help
