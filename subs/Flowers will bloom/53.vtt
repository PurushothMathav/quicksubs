1
00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.900
Nothing. I'm just a little chilly.

2
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.800
This is for distinguished guests

3
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.233
Why are you sitting here?

4
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.100
You're not gonna listen to me, are you?

5
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.800
Wait for the staff to chase you away.

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.100
Shame on you

7
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.900
Didn't you say the first row is for distinguished guests?

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.266
Kick this idle person out for me

9
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.400
Welcome.

10
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.166
The organizers have repeatedly explained

11
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.066
You are one of the most important guests

12
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.166
If we do anything snub

13
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.400
Please bear with me.

14
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.666
You don't have to entertain me

15
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.766
Go to work

16
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.866
Who are you?

17
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.566
Why are you sitting in the first row?

18
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.000
When you don't know someone's identity

19
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.200
That means you don't deserve to know

20
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.633
Are you mistaken?

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.333
You don't say

22
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.266
Is the first row made for distinguished guests?

23
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.900
He's just a bankrupt daughter's sidekick
