1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.366
After he ran out that day

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.100
Because of excessive sadness

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.033
mental illness

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.200
So make a fool of yourself

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.633
It's all my fault

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.600
Shouldn't ignore his explanation

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.666
Where is he now?

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.166
Said he was dead

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.600
I don't believe it.

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.700
Is he in the hospital now?

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.500
Tell me which hospital he is in.

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.033
Tell me where he is

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.066
What's the use of telling you

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:28.766
In your eyes

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.166
All white is just an ugly, fat woman

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.466
If you just want to express your compassion

17
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.633
No need.

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.000
He's doing great.

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.266
Don't need you

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.400
I'm not trying to express my pity.

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.200
I love him.

22
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.366
I have always loved the one who is by my side

23
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.200
Accompany me

24
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.566
People who have been through lows

25
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.600
The person who sings me a lullaby when I can't sleep at night

26
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.500
No matter whether he is rich or poor, beautiful or ugly

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.366
I don't care.

28
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.000
If you had known that that woman was a buckwheat

29
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.800
wheat

30
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.900
But he was ugly and fat.

31
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.200
Will you still love him?

32
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.866
I will definitely

33
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:11.000
I don't believe there are so many beautiful women around you

34
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.400
How can you fall in love with buckwheat?

35
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400
No.

36
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:14.966
You know

37
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.300
The most important thing around me is beautiful women

38
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.700
All I need is the buckwheat that can sing me to sleep

39
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:23.566
wheat
