00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.133
Sir, can you take a look at our house?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.933
All the best locations

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.466
Look

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.066
Mr. Shen

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.800
Mr. Shen, why are you here?

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.100
Lianxin, yes, so you work here?

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.133
I made you laugh.

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.066
Are you coming to buy a house?

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.600
Yes, god man

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.700
This is

11
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.266
And this is...

12
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.400
A friend I met during my expedition to the United States

13
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.700
Mr. Shen, are you young?

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.833
You saved my life.

15
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.866
Ah, Mrs. Shen

16
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.366
Mrs. Shen

17
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.300
Mr. Shen can only save our lives

18
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.366
There's nothing else we can do outside.

19
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.600
Don't worry, Mr. Shen.

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.333
Do you want to buy a house?

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.066
This is our good house.

22
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.766
Tell me what kind of house you want.

23
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.466
Guaranteed to give you the biggest discount.

24
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.033
So I'll take you to see the fire now

25
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.966
Who is so short-sighted?

26
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.233
Let all the beggars in?

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.700
Mr. Jiang, this is a client who came to buy a house.

28
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.500
He bought a house

29
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:06.766
Ah!

30
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.100
My teeth hurt when I laugh

31
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.700
Don't you think he looks like someone who can buy a house?

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.500
Ah!

33
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.133
Oh.

34
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.933
This beautiful woman is not bad looking

35
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.166
She bought you a house

36
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.766
You deserve it. Forget it.

37
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.466
Why don't you go with your brother?

38
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.700
I'll buy you a big villa tonight

39
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.100
I suggest you show some respect

40
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.766
Find a lady

41
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.866
What are you doing?
