00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.266
kid

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:04.333
Do you think you can have a big breath without brushing your teeth?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.833
Can't you understand human language?

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.333
I said our Lingyun room

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.066
A building costs at least 50 million

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.100
Poor people like you can't afford it for a lifetime

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.800
God, either we should forget it

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.033
Mr. Yang has no

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.900
Don't you love to pretend?

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.200
I'll let you pack enough today.

11
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.200
Manager Sun asked how many existing houses you have now

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
Figure it all out for me

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.966
Boy, if you can't afford it today

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.666
It goes right under the bone.

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.633
There is another way.

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.900
Let the beautiful woman accompany me for one night

17
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.600
Let you go

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.000
What if I could afford it?

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.033
OK, if you can afford it today

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.400
I will give you all the tea leaves in my name for free.

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.300
Hmph, I don't like your industries

22
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.966
I just want you to be my watchdog

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.466
It's a deal.

24
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.300
Boy, you are optimistic about it.

25
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.400
Our Lingyun house costs a minimum of 50 million

26
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.766
There are more than 20 in total.

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.333
It's 1 billion

28
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.300
This miscellaneous management fee

29
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.433
Even if you 1.20 billion

30
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.800
Cheap enough, hahahaha.

31
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.500
How come there are so many?

32
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.100
Why don't we just forget it?

33
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.366
No Wang Jing, I'll pay
