1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.966
Yes, sir.

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:05.066
Please, our super VIP, I welcome you

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.366
I see which of you dares to move

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.600
Miss, may I remind you

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.000
Our hotel is owned by the Pregnancy Group

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.300
We prefer a high-quality distinguished bite

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.233
Good idea.

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.300
Then open your eyes and see if it's okay?

9
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.100
This card knows

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.366
Mr. George personally issued the black card

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.166
Are you our super VIP?

12
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.400
Are you fucking blind?

13
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.500
He is a courier.

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.766
How could you recognize the missing

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.566
George is so shameless

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.200
Are you acting?

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.933
You're not even qualified to kick Mr. George's shoes

18
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.266
How could you possibly have a black card?

19
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.700
That is.

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.700
He must know Lin Shao

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.300
I'm going to treat you to dinner today

22
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.166
To support myself

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.966
So I created a fake card

24
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.966
If it is fake, you will know after swallowing it.

25
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.433
Yes, yes, yes, it's true or not, don't eat it either.

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.166
Lin Shao is right

27
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.266
His card is fake

28
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.200
Hahahaha

29
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.200
Shenyang

30
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.666
What else do you have to quibble about?

31
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.233
How dare George lie to me?

32
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.300
Somebody impersonate these two

33
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.333
Mr. George's VIP guy threw it out for me

34
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.300
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.233
Don't you like to pretend?

36
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.400
Good idea.

37
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.800
Then you lick everyone's shoes clean

38
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.800
Or you don't even think about leaving this room
