00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.100
Thank you, sir.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.266
If it weren't for you

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.633
I will be taken as a slave by them

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.233
It's okay, use mine.

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.266
I can keep you safe, sir

6
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.700
Hey where are they

7
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.433
Boss, they're in the dungeon

8
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.000
You're finished.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.066
Hahahaha

10
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.766
Our boss will be here soon.

11
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:33.133
Today, even if you stick your wings, you can't go to the United States.

12
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.200
Just waiting to be captured by the Shen family

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.400
Sir, I implicated you

14
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.766
Run away

15
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.766
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

16
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.666
Do you know where the others are being held?

17
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
I don't know.

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.500
I heard they were censored and made subordinates.

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.300
Ok guys ok come

20
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.400
Shen Tian, this bastard

21
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.166
He regards the Shen family as his palace

22
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.366
Shen Tian

23
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.266
It was your fault

24
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.933
Shen family waste

25
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.366
When you were a kid, you were not as good as anything

26
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.900
Why am I looking for abuse again?

27
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.600
Oh, dear.

28
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.900
Isn't this my plaything?

29
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.366
What, you want to save him?

30
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.266
Kneel down and beg me

31
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.066
Beg me and I'll give him to you

32
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.500
Xiaotian, you use the name of the Shen family

33
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.600
Doing such a shameful thing

34
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:38.533
IF

35
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.133
It's not that the old man insists on

36
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.866
The position of head of the house is passed on to you

37
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.033
I'm about to make that big play

38
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.266
It's unbearable

39
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.766
Oops, it doesn't matter.

40
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.366
Kill you

41
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.866
No one knows how I became one

42
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.666
The hum of the head of the Shen family

43
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.800
up

44
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:07.633
You trash, go

45
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.600
Don't be idle

46
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.033
It's just a brain

47
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.900
Kung fu can't, you have a waste

48
00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:17.466
Ah!

49
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.500
Ah!

50
00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:20.166
Ah!

51
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.200
Is Mr. Chen alright?

52
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.166
When did you practice your skills?

53
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.600
Stop talking nonsense, you notify the Shen family now

54
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.200
Let him release everyone he caught

55
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.100
otherwise

56
00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.500
I will kill my relatives righteously

57
00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:36.066
Kill me!

58
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.966
You can save all the people who capture the Shen family
