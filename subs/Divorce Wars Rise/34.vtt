00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.700
What are you thinking?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.566
Uh nothing I suddenly thought of an old friend

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.566
Mr. George's origins are all over the world

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.533
Restoring the head is even more clear-cut in the world

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.733
If we can take it today

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.266
Restore the overseas channels of the head

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.800
Your family will be impressed by you

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.033
They will never say no to dinner again

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.466
By the way, Mr. George

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.300
But very obsessed with the world

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.166
You can't toast, don't talk nonsense

12
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:28.966
OK

13
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.300
Hello, I'm Ye Wanting from the Night Market Group.

14
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.866
We are here to discuss cooperation with Mr. George

15
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.500
Ok, this way please.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.333
There is no way.

17
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.900
I can only go in first.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.266
Why don't you wait here?

19
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.600
Go ahead.

20
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.800
Boss, this is Miss Ye.

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.566
Nice to meet you Mr. George

22
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.600
Hello miss

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.133
Mr. George

24
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:15.933
What about this contract?

25
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.333
It has been as we communicated before.

26
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.400
It has been written.

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.633
Our Ye family is very concerned about this cooperation.

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.600
Miss Ye

29
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.866
It seems you don't want to cooperate with our skeptical group

30
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.966
What!
