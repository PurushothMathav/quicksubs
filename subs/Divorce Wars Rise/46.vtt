00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.966
It seems that Ye Wan is like that idiot

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.366
Definitely put what I said at the meeting that day

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.766
I passed it on to my own

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.366
What are you getting together?

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.566
No money.

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.833
30 billion zero

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.400
Sir, it is illegal for you to bid like this.

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.266
We increase the price by at least 100 million each time, not

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.800
Why is it only one piece?

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.200
Are you out of money?

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.166
How about this?

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.733
Bring your wife to my bed at night

13
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.333
Have fun serving me

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.233
Dude, that adds up to 30.10 billion

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.900
How come?

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
Doesn't he have 30 billion? How dare he continue to pay?

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.866
Could it be that he has private money?

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.266
It's all for today's sake

19
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.700
I have to send 40 billion today

20
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.800
Wow, the price 40 billion

21
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.100
This land is really only worth 100 million.

22
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.066
400 million 50 billion

23
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.800
Shen Yan, don't add it, we don't have so much money.

24
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.733
Don't worry, wife.

25
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.800
I have my own way

26
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.166
Are you looking for death?

27
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.000
50 billion anyone increase the price?

28
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.366
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.566
I'll make a call.

30
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.666
Mr. Shen, it's me

31
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.066
News of the development of Nancheng by Diyun Group

32
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.166
It's accurate.

33
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.466
Now the industrialists have raised their prices to 50 billion

34
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.000
Then continue to increase the price.

35
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.233
Do I still need to pay for this?

36
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.100
Mr. Shen

37
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.466
I really want to solve your problems.

38
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.266
But I can't come up with that much money right now

39
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.100
If I could have 30 billion now

40
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.600
I promise I will be able to take this land in the southern city

41
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.300
Don't let me down.

42
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.400
The consequences of disappointing me

43
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.466
Don't worry, Mr. Shi knows.

44
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.833
I will definitely take this place today
