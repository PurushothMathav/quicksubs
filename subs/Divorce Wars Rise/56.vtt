00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.966
Mr. George

2
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.800
You are here, this is it, I will kneel for you.

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.700
It doesn't matter who you offend

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.400
Mr. George is innocent

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.366
You see him with fake brown sugar

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.833
Can't read it

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.666
The black card of our Huanyu Group

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.566
Only the reading managers of the most high-end card swiping groups

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.166
You're fired.

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.700
Somebody get him out of here

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.900
Mr. George, I was wrong.

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.800
Mr. George, give me a chance

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:25.966
You are what he called

14
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.366
Hello Wang Xiaohei

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.766
You see me again

16
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.666
Did you make a mistake?

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.566
Ah, everybody.

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.933
Let me introduce

19
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.933
This is the heir to the Universal Group

20
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.000
Missing teaching positions

21
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.000
That's very powerful in the United States

22
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.266
Ah me you may have forgotten

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.566
I am the supervisor of our overseas sales headquarters.

24
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.400
My name is lino

25
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.900
Hmm configuration

26
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:57.866
Hey wait wait

27
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.766
Well, you're busy.

28
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.300
I don't remember, it's normal for me.

29
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.300
Well, as for this person impersonating your VIP

30
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.533
I'll handle it.

31
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.766
Why did you bother to answer me yourself?

32
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.866
Mr. Shen is a super worker of our Huanyu Group.

33
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.900
You can stop it too

34
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.900
You are also fired

35
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:24.833
What Shenyang City welcomes to feel like a super VIP

36
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.566
Hahaha, oops, this Shenyang

37
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.166
I blamed you just now, haha.

38
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.233
Look at you

39
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.200
A snob like you

40
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.800
It's not worthy of being a teacher at all.

41
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:45.966
Oath Brothers

42
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.033
We are brothers

43
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.666
Look at this today

44
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:52.600
Oath Brothers

45
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.266
Our family is young and old

46
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.100
I'm the only one left to live

47
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.633
You adults don't remember villains

48
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.466
Just treat me like a fart

49
00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:04.966
Good idea.

50
00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.000
Before I let you go

51
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:09.566
I want to ask you something and you answer like this

52
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.733
You go out first

53
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.300
I have something to talk to him alone
