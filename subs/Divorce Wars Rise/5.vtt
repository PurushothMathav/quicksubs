00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.700
Who are you?

2
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.900
Three years ago, my grandfather made a marriage contract for me

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.866
Is the man on the engagement date you?

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.033
Uh, it's me, hahaha.

5
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.666
Shen Yan

6
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.000
And here it is.

7
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.766
Haha, where did you find this actor?

8
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.933
How much is it?

9
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.033
Is this a monthly subscription?

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.733
But no day.

11
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.600
Hahahahahahaha

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.300
Switch arms and open mouth

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.000
Ah!

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.400
How dare you hit me?

15
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.000
The woman who dares to beat me

16
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.700
Do you know who I am?

17
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.266
Hey, don't blame me for not reminding you.

18
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.500
The daughter of the Ye family is something you can't afford to offend

19
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.700
Ye family daughter

20
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.500
Ye family daughter

21
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.300
Shen Yan, you lie

22
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.600
Don't see who is lying

23
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.466
Li Shao, but he has been friendly with the Ye family for generations

24
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.133
How could Li Shao not know?

25
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.266
What does the daughter of the Ye family look like?

26
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.200
Stop pretending here

27
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.933
Our lady hasn't shown her real face for three years

28
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.433
How do you know that?

29
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:14.966
How dare you question

30
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.400
I see you are clearly pretending to be an underarm market

31
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.966
Of course it is.

32
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.833
Otherwise why does he keep wearing a veil?

33
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.466
Oh, I see.

34
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.533
It must be.

35
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.333
He's ugly.

36
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.333
Can't see people

37
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.300
Hahaha, I'm picking up a TV now

38
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.466
True Life

39
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.833
Ah, I let you go last time

40
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.366
I won't show mercy this time

41
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.466
I'll tell you what.

42
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.366
I'll forget you now

43
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.200
Let go of Mr. Li

44
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.033
Let go of Mr. Li

45
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.066
Ah!
