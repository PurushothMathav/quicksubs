00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.566
Pay attention to this

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.900
Then

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.266
Lick mine first

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.166
The newly bought one is kneeling.

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.233
Wait a minute.

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.266
You remember it for me.

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
Be sure to lick it clean

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.466
Lan Lan these shoes

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.366
But I just bought it 500,000

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.600
If it gets dirty

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:28.000
Be careful I stare at your tongue

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.100
Kneel down and lick your shoes

13
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.600
Hey go go go go lick your shoes go go

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.000
It's just too much.

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.666
I'll see who dares to make him kneel

16
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.166
I said where did this woman come from?

17
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.200
So skin care

18
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.233
Are you a skin care product?

19
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.366
Miss Ye, let me remind you

20
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.900
This is the Muni Hotel

21
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.166
Not your Ye family

22
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.800
Our hotel has its own rules

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.100
Don't you know Ye

24
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.466
Is Jia a partner of Huanyu Group?

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000
You are not afraid to offend the Ye family

26
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.133
Of course I know.

27
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.300
However, the Ye family

28
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.566
Compared to Mr. George's super VIP

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.733
Simply not worth mentioning

30
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.700
Just a little manager

31
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.500
Dare to speak so wildly

32
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.566
Even George himself?

33
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.000
You have to bow down to us

34
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.133
Ouch, did I hear you right?

35
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.500
I don't see it.

36
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.600
You are also a big talker.

37
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.033
No wonder this Ye family is a second-rate family

38
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.366
Shen Yan

39
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.066
As a child, you don't know how to understand the world

40
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.200
I didn't expect to grow up

41
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.666
You can't even be a fat son-in-law

42
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.700
I really didn't miss it when I was a teacher

43
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.833
It's just a rat without a name

44
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.566
How dare you comment so late at night

45
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.566
Somebody take this unknowable thing

46
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:46.633
Throw it out

47
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:50.766
Who offended my VIP?
