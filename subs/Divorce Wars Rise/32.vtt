00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.300
I want to listen to music at night

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.166
Before they signed the contract

3
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.100
Advancement Department and Huanyi Group please make an appointment

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.200
Such a double adventure

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.800
Or nothing

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.700
Or Qin Shaoming

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.166
At that time

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.966
This night hall is completely dead

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.166
In the end, you have to come and save me

10
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.066
I don't mind having another pair of sisters either

11
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.700
Then I want to make it big.

12
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:32.900
OK

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.433
Let you make it big

14
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.866
This night court

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.833
Just one of my playthings

16
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.000
Wanting

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.100
I'm coming for you.

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.366
As if writing

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.366
Why are you here?

20
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.633
Wanting, I thought about it all night last night

21
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.700
I realized I shouldn't have done this to you.

22
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.133
We're a family.

23
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.700
Shouldn't speak two languages

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.566
We should work together.

25
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.400
Overcoming family difficulties?

26
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.166
Sister Wanru, do you really think so?

27
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.033
OK

28
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.600
I'm so glad you understand.

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.200
But anyway.

30
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.133
Working so late

31
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.366
Must be hard

32
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.166
Hey

33
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.033
You sit first

34
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.500
You see

35
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.833
This is the chicken soup I made just for you

36
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.366
You need a drink?

37
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.600
I was sick.

38
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.233
Thank you, Sister Wanru.

39
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.000
Thank you for what?

40
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.866
Drink it, I'm cold

41
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.066
Sister Wanru has a heart

42
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:15.600
How does it hurt?

43
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.566
How about it? You must be too tired.

44
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:21.600
You have to rest

45
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.966
Xie Wanting

46
00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.800
Don't blame me for being cold
