00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.133
Sir, what about this fund?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.666
There is only one last day left.

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.000
If you don't buy it now

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400
We don't know when the next opening will be.

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.933
I know but the money I have on hand

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.800
It's money for my mother's surgery

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.200
Don't you want your mother

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.466
For better treatment?

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.000
Don't you want your mother to be in a better hospital?

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.500
I think you are a dutiful son.

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.966
I'll tell you a secret secretly.

12
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:21.933
Our fund

13
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.833
It will rise to more than 50% when the market opens tomorrow.

14
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.666
You buy it today and you can take it out tomorrow.

15
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.500
It won't delay you giving your mother at all.

16
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
The cost of treating these hospitals

17
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.266
OK. I'll buy it now. Later.

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.400
You can fall for such a simple deception

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.566
Can you believe it?

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.866
You hurry to the hospital now

21
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.400
Pay for your mother's hospital bills

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.633
kid

23
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.600
When you play with me

24
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.366
You think I'm doing charity

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.800
You people

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.100
unscrupulous

27
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.100
Throwing buildings to harm compatriots

28
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.100
Call me and teach him a good lesson

29
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.266
Except the head

30
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.166
Call anywhere else

31
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.233
Hmph, I'm very rich

32
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.800
Yesmeda

33
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.766
You, you, don't come here

34
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you know who is behind this company?

35
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.133
It's a building you can't afford to mess with

36
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.200
Shen Family Shen Jie

37
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.766
Shen Tian, none of you can escape

38
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800
No one can save you who are murdering your fellow citizens

39
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.866
I need you to do one more thing now
