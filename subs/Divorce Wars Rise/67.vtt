00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
Duke Shen

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.766
Thanks to you for helping me save Langang Commercial Street

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.866
No one took my wife's things away

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.666
Husband is so nice

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.766
Since I left the Ye family

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.566
It's always been you in charge

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.600
I will also do my part for this little family

8
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.300
You see, this is the fund I went to the company to talk about today.

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.633
It only took one day to invest and went up by 100 million

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.433
Let me see.

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.333
Is this Shen Tian's enterprise?

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.933
Look, this is a branch office.

13
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.200
The head office is in the United States

14
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.033
They're going to invite me on an expedition tomorrow.

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.466
United States

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.233
Hey wife

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.033
America is a long way away

18
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.066
I'll handle this kind of thing

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.733
Are you in charge of the big picture at home?

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.500
OK, then be careful on the way.

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.900
Is it okay?

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.800
The owner found out the boss behind the company

23
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.866
It is Shen Tian

24
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.633
As expected

25
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.300
That was him?

26
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.666
This company is based in the United States

27
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.966
Recently, many companies have been deceived by them.

28
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.566
Shen Tian didn't expect it to be him

29
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.500
Using the Shen family to do this kind of thing that destroys the building

30
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.100
Must get rid of him

31
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.366
I'll do it now.

32
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.633
No, I'll do it myself.

33
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.633
Arrange an identity for me

34
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.266
Send me to Ming
