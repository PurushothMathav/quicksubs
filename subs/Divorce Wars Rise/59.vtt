00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.366
I'm talking about you Ye Wenting

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.266
Kneel down on your sister's knees

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.933
Let your sister be in front of Qin Shao

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.600
Say good things for our Ye family

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.300
Let's see if we can let go of our Ye family

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.400
It's not impossible to let you go

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.366
As long as you obediently hand over Langang Commercial Street

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:19.966
Qin Shao may let you continue to live in Jiangcheng

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.700
It's so vicious

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.866
You must be cowardly

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.400
The Langang business money seized by that beast

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.166
That was the only thing my mother left me to rely on

13
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.766
Why can't you tell which is more important?

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.433
The most important thing now is the employed

15
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.833
That's a company owned by Wanting

16
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.200
It has nothing to do with you industrialists

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.133
Then I'll use the entire stake of the vice president

18
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.900
In exchange for Lanjo Commercial Street

19
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.433
This is what you said.

20
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.166
Don't go back, don't go back

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.100
Such a wild house now

22
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.700
But also afraid

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.300
person

24
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:01.966
Wife

25
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.633
In fact, you shouldn't trade equity for columns

26
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.433
The current equity of the Ye family is no longer valuable

27
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.200
If you can trade equity for draft business money

28
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700
It can be regarded as my explanation to my mother

29
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.766
This is Qin Qiang

30
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.866
Instruct the land to make trouble

31
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.200
They also forced us to transfer the company's equity

32
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.733
Let all my entrepreneurs get love

33
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.433
Don't worry about your wife.

34
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.966
I will protect Hong Kong's commercial street with you

35
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.266
We will go there tomorrow to receive management.

36
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.366
Tell them we won't compromise

37
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.266
I'd like to see it

38
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.700
Who dares to make trouble?

39
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.033
Yes, I am.
