00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.533
Today Mr. George's super member arrived at the hotel

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.100
What about super members?

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.100
I'll receive it right away

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.333
You hurry up and inform Mr. George

5
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.500
Go now

6
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.100
Sit down everyone

7
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.766
As expected of the style of the Muni Hotel

8
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.833
This environment is really nice.

9
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.166
Hey, some poor guy

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.666
Today is for you to learn more

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.900
If you walk out this door

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.200
You are probably not qualified to sit in it again in your life

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.400
Students, stay safe.

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.333
Mr. Wang

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.000
Teacher Wang is here, Teacher Wang, sit down, sit down

16
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.466
Teacher Wang, sit here

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.366
Everyone sit down, sit down, hahaha.

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.000
Oops, haven't seen you in so many years?

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.766
You've all grown up, hahaha.

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.233
Do you still remember me?

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.033
That year's exam, I took the second to last in our class

22
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.000
You are this hi

23
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.466
That year?

24
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:59.700
I sent you a Kunlun jade ornament, ha.

25
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.666
Ha Yiyang hahaha

26
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.666
Mr. Wang

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:08.833
I gave away an SUV with a few knives.

28
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.866
Lin Beng

29
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.833
Miss Wang has a good memory.

30
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.800
But yeah

31
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.833
I call configuration now

32
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.000
Ah.

33
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.800
Configuration oops

34
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.066
Good name, good name, haha.

35
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.466
Thanks to a good student like you.

36
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:27.266
Can we eat in such a luxurious hotel?

37
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.400
Ah yeah hahaha

38
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.033
Teacher Wang has flattered you.

39
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.633
These are all taught by you.

40
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.866
But the environment here compared to what I had abroad

41
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.566
It's really a little worse

42
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:42.100
So, I can only aggrieve you first, oops.

43
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.166
Do you feel promising?

44
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.833
A few days gone

45
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.400
It's okay to become so ugly

46
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:51.500
After all, aren't you also from the building?

47
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:54.100
This classmate is Mr. Wang

48
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:56.833
His name is Shen Yan

49
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.266
He is a courier now.

50
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.300
Now.

51
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.433
But the one who is the worst in our class

52
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:06.633
Haha.

53
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:08.300
I remember now.

54
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.866
It turned out to be this useless thing

55
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.800
Back then, the class said you wouldn't come

56
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:19.166
Shenyang, look at you now

57
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.766
Our class is now worth over 100 million people

58
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.666
You poor loser

59
00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.166
What qualifications do you have with me?

60
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.300
We've had enough to eat together

61
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:29.966
You guys are going too far.

62
00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:32.000
Let's go, let's not eat
