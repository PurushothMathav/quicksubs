00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:05.066
Who are you doing?

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.100
Dare to drop Qin Shao's congratulatory gift

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.933
What do you count me next time?

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.100
Drop my stuff

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.366
Just a fake

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.166
As for all the fuss?

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.333
Joke Qin Shao's identity is so noble

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.066
How can you give a fake gift?

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.600
You said my stuff was fake.

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.166
Today, if you can't produce evidence

11
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.266
I'll let you be a cow and a horse to lose money to atone for your sins

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.233
It's over, something big is going to happen

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.800
Zhuo Wei, please see

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.100
What microwave oven is written above?

15
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.000
Hahahahahahahahahaha

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.600
Hahaha, try it first.

17
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.333
Drinking alcohol is also heated in the microwave oven. Impossible?

18
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.500
The gift given by Mr. Qin is actually a pornographic product

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.766
This is too embarrassing for Young Master Qin. Come here

20
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.533
Shall I ask you to buy a high-quality imitation?

21
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.400
Why did you buy me such a shitty thing?

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.600
Captain, I was wrong. I was wrong

23
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.633
Go over there and stand with the trash can and roll

24
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.966
I'm really sorry just now

25
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.666
People don't do things well

26
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.433
The inspection product that cost tens of millions to buy

27
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.200
I'm so sorry.

28
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.433
I'll have someone tomorrow.

29
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.766
Send another baby of equal value.

30
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.200
Hey, okay, you're welcome.

31
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.766
Those are already very precious.

32
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.700
Unchanged

33
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.700
Oh, I almost forgot.

34
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.466
I'm going to give it to that guest today.

35
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.066
A chance to show

36
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.900
Shen Yan

37
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.800
Ye Lao's birthday party today

38
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.266
What do you got?

39
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.266
You didn't bring anything, did you?

40
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.500
You won't be empty-handed.

41
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.466
Are you coming to attend Ye Lao's birthday banquet?
