00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.333
Hey, big brother, these are the money given by Mr. Chen.

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.166
Hey, brother, what move did you use just now?

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.166
You teach me

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:09.100
Okay, then you can follow me for a year

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.033
Hey, okay, okay, hey.

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.266
These two beautiful women will send you to your room at night

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.066
Hahaha, you can.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.266
Shit

9
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.166
Hey, wife, why are you here all of a sudden?

10
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.666
I think I'm disturbing your happiness.

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.666
Hey, old boss, don't be angry.

12
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.266
It's all a play

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.333
Fake, you're killing me.

14
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.500
I don't know how to call home so late

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.066
This must be my sister-in-law, she is so beautiful.

16
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.666
Heroes match beauties, this is a perfect match, a perfect match

17
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.066
I see you're having a good time

18
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.666
Do you remember how you felt?

19
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.233
Oh oh yes yes yes

20
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.766
I will call the debt that fell at night.

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.400
A useful place to find a younger brother in the future

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.966
The younger brother should go through fire and water

23
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.200
Goodbye little brother

24
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.200
Hurry up

25
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.333
Bastard, don't get me wrong

26
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.500
I definitely didn't do anything wrong to you.

27
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.366
Go home and find a village chief

28
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.466
Are you not hurt today? It's alright.

29
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.800
Unscathed

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.666
That would be fine.

31
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.600
But you can get the money back from Viper

32
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.000
I really didn't expect it.

33
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.566
How did you come back?

34
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.700
Is that so?

35
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.433
What about me and the viper?

36
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.566
hit it off

37
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.600
And we started talking.

38
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.900
He will feel very compatible

39
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.366
Well, he's willing to pay me back what he owes

40
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.800
That simple, yeah?

41
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.666
That's it.

42
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.300
Fine

43
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.433
Then let's hurry home and inform them, walk home
