1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.800
Master Shen and counted from the hands of the Viper Gang

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.300
Cool stuff.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.033
The Ye family didn't raise you for so many years in vain?

4
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.100
What did he want?

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.500
He is a low-level person with no money, no power, and no ability

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.866
What does he want?

7
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.600
Hey, tell me how you got back

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.433
I guess the viper came down to die

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.266
You must have slept with him to get the debt back

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.900
Then give credit

11
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.166
Remember this meal and your head

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.100
You're going too far

13
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.866
Oh, dear.

14
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.900
What is your ability, a viper bag?

15
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.666
But some people

16
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.100
Obviously Fudan's hen

17
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.166
I don't recognize my parents

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.200
presumptuous

19
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.900
Who gave you the right to talk to me like that?

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.800
You what?

21
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.400
What's the noise?

22
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.033
The crisis of the Ye family has not passed yet

23
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.500
Is this debt?

24
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.566
Can't last a few days

25
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.466
Wanru, why don't you save Young Master Qin?

26
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.566
Let him give them a way to live

27
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.433
No way.

28
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.833
How could our Ye family become the dogs of the Qin family?

29
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.266
If you don't go to the Qin family, who will you go to?

30
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.733
Do you want us to be like your husband?

31
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.433
Do you live by delivering express?

32
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.833
I do have a way to find a job

33
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.400
Not only can you survive the crisis of the industry

34
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.900
You can even make a comeback.

35
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.433
How?
