00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.733
Earth Cloud Group

2
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.000
Isn't the Dragon Palace always supporting you?

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.000
If this offends the Earth Cloud Group

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.600
Blame our Ye family

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.033
How can that be?

6
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.833
Ye Wanting, look at your good husband

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.933
Master Shen is just an ordinary person

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.500
How could he have gone to Earth Cloud Group?

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Steal something so valuable

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.066
Master Shen is because of me

11
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.300
Just got involved in this unforgettable disaster

12
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.266
He was grandpa's benefactor.

13
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.666
I can't put him in danger

14
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.700
Young Master Qin, for the sake of the friendship between our two families

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.500
Now this treasure, we will return it in full

16
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.566
Please don't disturb the extremes of hell

17
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.033
Don't hurt the abyss

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.966
Actually, this thing?

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.633
It's not that hard

20
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.900
As long as we are a family

21
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.166
Everything is negotiable, what do you think?

22
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.100
OK

23
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.400
I promised to marry into Clearance

24
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.766
This is what you said, monitor

25
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.366
I don't agree with that.

26
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.766
Shen Yan, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.366
I didn't think of it either.

28
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.800
Things will turn out the way they are today

29
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.566
So I just play the piano

30
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.866
To protect you

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.400
And here I am today.

32
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.466
No one can touch you boy

33
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.366
No tears without seeing the coffin, right?

34
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.066
Let's go

35
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.266
Hey you

36
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.700
You call someone

37
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.866
I'd like to see it

38
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.400
Who from Diyun Group dares to stand up for you?
