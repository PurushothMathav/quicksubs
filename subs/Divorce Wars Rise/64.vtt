00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.100
You said that the courier is the chairperson of Blue Port.

2
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.500
How is that possible?

3
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.433
Shen Yan is the chairperson of Langang

4
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.600
Shen Yan spent more than a billion

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.000
The big man who took over Langang

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.800
You read it wrong.

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.966
You read it wrong.

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.066
Let me tell you something.

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.866
The chairperson said

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
Dealing with group loan management

11
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.000
Hurry up and pack my things for me, let's go

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.433
Do you hear me?

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.200
How could I be doomed?

14
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.200
I'm so beautiful

15
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.500
I am now officially breaking up with you.

16
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.233
I didn't expect that I, Su Yueqing, would also be wrong

17
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.000
I actually see you as a trash

18
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.366
Now Shen Yan

19
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.066
She is my new boyfriend, Su Yueqing

20
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.500
You eat inside and out

21
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.300
And

22
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.666
Don't you forget how much you got from me?

23
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.433
sister

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.466
I am the chairperson's high school classmate

25
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.266
Get out of the way

26
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.766
We haven't seen each other for a long time

27
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.700
No, I'll invite you to dinner tonight.

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.600
Come on, let go of your hand first

29
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.733
I am a courier.

30
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.466
Don't contaminate you

31
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.800
No matter how high-end perfume is, it can't be covered.

32
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm here to forward entertainment

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.366
It has something to do with his uncle's attitude

34
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.966
You don't have to worry about that.

35
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.766
I will check these things one by one.

36
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.800
As for you, you can't escape

37
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
Are you right for me? Hey, do you have the heart?
