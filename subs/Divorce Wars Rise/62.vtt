18
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.200
Kneel down and apologize

19
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.766
Humph

20
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.800

26
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.900
In my place, I don't like anyone who has to get out

27
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.200
I like it.

28
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.533
Even a dog

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.233
I can also get him up early

30
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.666
Brother Qiang has already told him just now

31
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.966
Here, not just anyone comes in

32
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.566

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.366
People are really scared to death

34
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.966
You go away

35
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.900

So arrogant

40
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.700
I'm not afraid of this company asking how

41
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.966
In my place, my rules are rules

42
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.900
You can't control it.

43
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:35.266
Get out of here

44
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.033
