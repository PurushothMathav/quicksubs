00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
Get out of here

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.700
Otherwise, it wouldn't be as simple as knocking you down

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.500
roll

4
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.966
Hmm, are you good at fighting?

5
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.833
Can you protect them all?

6
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.500
I'll tell you what.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.033
I'll let the Vipers

8
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.300
All my men are squatting near the Langang Commercial Street

9
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.200
Follow everyone who comes in and out of here

10
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.466
At that time

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.966
I see who dares to enter your Langang Commercial Street

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.700
Who dares to come to work here?

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.833
Vipers, right?

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.600
Report your hall master

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.500
Lao Tzu is the head of the second hall of the Viper Gang, Python

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:46.400
Viper lends you to come to Blue Port Business Gold within 5 minutes

17
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.000
Clean up the portal

18
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.100
Do you know the leader?

19
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.900
Hey, hey.

20
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.566
Why don't you say you know the owner of the dragon shop?

21
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.466
Lock down here now

22
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.000
Don't let a fly in there.

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.166
Okay. What do you want?

24
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.266
Is there any king's law?

25
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.433
Wang law

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.866
Lao Tzu is the king

27
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.766
Tell you

28
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.566
Better be obedient to me

29
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.066
No one is yelling here

30
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.233
Whether to rent a car or not to help scammers

31
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.066
Don't worry.

32
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.266
It's me uh

33
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.566
Why are you here?

34
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.600
Ouch.

35
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.200
If I don't come, we will pick up the red car here.

36
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.200
Hey, does the girl want to kidnap the demon back?

37
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.000
Please uncle

38
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.800
helper

39
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.500
Misunderstanding, this person is a small vendor

40
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.466
There are so many of us.

41
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.700
Don't be afraid of him

42
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.100
You fool

43
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:41.833
This is my boss, Master Shen, Mr. Shen, what is he?

44
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.000
He is actually Shen Shenyan

45
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.666
Can you save Mr. Shen in the future?

46
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.966
Mr. Shen, you don't remember villains

47
00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:59.266
It's just that I haven't known Mount Tai for a long time

48
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.466
Please let me go

49
00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:02.000
Stop talking nonsense and talk quickly

50
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.300
Who sent you?

51
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.200
Yes!

52
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.400
The Shen family sent me here

53
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.100
Shen family
