1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.466
Under the tree, Xiaoqiang meets the chairperson

2
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.233
10 minutes ago

3
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.000
Haven't we already met?

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.166
Mix the same thing

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
The position of chairperson is all you can do

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.566
Oh Manager Wang

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.933
He ran around here

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.000
My question.

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.166
I'll call security to kick him out later

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.600
Mr. Shen is our new chairperson

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.133
He's not just a scare

12
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.666
Their new chairperson is not a beauty

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.833
Female? Bastard

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.100
The company is nominally handed over to Miss Ye

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.866
But the actual manager is still Mr. Shen in front of you

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.233
He just draws the courier, how is that possible?

17
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.800
Okay, okay, do you need to repeat it a second time?

18
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.800
You weren't a mouth just now

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.700
Are you saying that this floor is all yours?

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.566
Ah, everyone is here now.

21
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.800
You go on

22
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.800
We're here. Come on

23
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.866
Not the chairperson

24
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:00.066
Chairperson, I just don't know Mount Tai

25
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.466
There are already a large number of adults

26
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.100
Wang Xiaozi also became the king Wang Xiaozi

27
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.166
Not the emperor

28
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.566
I am your favorite junior

29
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.400
Please help me tell the chairperson

30
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.666
Let go, you're recruited

31
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.166
I just didn't expect you to have so little character

32
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.566
Chairperson, listen to me

33
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.300
Haven't you seen it?

34
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.800
Teacher, I'll deal with it right away

35
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.300
Not walk around walk around me
