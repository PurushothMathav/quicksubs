00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.233
Welcome the owner back

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.233
It's been three years without me

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.866
If you go back to the owner, it has been stable for the past three years

4
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.966
The Diyun Group you founded back then

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.200
With the support of Longdian, it has developed rapidly

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.666
It has now been ranked as the number one company in the world

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.366
It's a village with a mansion like a god

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.200
That's so great!

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.400
What about the Shen family?

10
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.600
Your brother Shen Tian has occupied all the property of the Shen family

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.500
And now there is no trace.

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.866
I heard that I am doing some shady industries

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.666
Our people have been giving birth

14
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.900
Good Shen Tian

15
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.533
For the Shen family business

16
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.700
Brotherhood

17
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.966
Keep checking

18
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.166
One day

19
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.733
I will definitely send his subordinates

20
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.300
And do you want to sign up?

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.566
Ye family daughter who is married to you

22
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.800
Night Court has been waiting for you for three years

23
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.300
But never lifted the veil

24
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.233
Why is that?

25
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.500
I heard he was waiting for you to uncover it for him yourself

26
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.600
Wait for me for three years

27
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.033
I can't take it

28
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.266
You go and arrange it.

29
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.566
I want to meet Miss Ye Wanting

30
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:22.533
Yo

31
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.166
Isn't this Shen Yan?

32
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:29.700
I said you are a courier.

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.066
How did you end up in a place like this?

34
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.366
Get out of here you come here

35
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.100
Are you here for a blind date?

36
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.100
Haha bro

37
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.833
I suggest you don't do this.

38
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.500
Because no one will look at a useless thing

39
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.900
Hahaha, who said no one likes him?
