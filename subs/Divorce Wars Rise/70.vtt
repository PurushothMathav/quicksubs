00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.666
You immediately

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.700
Return all the money

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.500
you

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.066
It's Starlight

5
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:10.100
Then the money has to be spit out

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.433
The name doesn't work, does it?

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.300
Then I'll let you experience it too.

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.666
What you call a dungeon

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.300
I don't eat or lose

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.100
Wait for the boy to give it to me, and then I will apply for the mountain works.

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.100
No no no no

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.033
This gentleman

13
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.600
I'll just do what you say.

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.500
Don't send me to the dungeon

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:36.966
If you receive it, I will arrange it.

16
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:44.866
Hello

17
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.566
Mr. Shen, hurry up and get a set

18
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.666
Someone smashed the scene

19
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.266
Who is so brave to come to my brother for fear of shit?

20
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.766
I'll be right there.

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.800
OK

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.366
Hey sir

23
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:06.000
The small one has been done as you ordered.

24
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:11.000
By the way, this is the dungeon you were talking about

25
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.766
Hey, yes, yes, yes.

26
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.433
Okay, take me there to see, sir

27
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:21.033
That place to worry about Xintian does not fit your identity

28
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.266
I want to see it

29
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.333
What so many words?

30
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.466
Oh, okay, okay, it's too cold, too cold, too cold.

31
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:28.933
Here you are.

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.800
A living person

33
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.500
To be treated like this

34
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.100
These dogs are so cruel

35
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:42.733
come

36
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.466
Open the door for me

37
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.433
Hahahaha

38
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:51.800
How have you been?

39
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.066
Are you all right?
