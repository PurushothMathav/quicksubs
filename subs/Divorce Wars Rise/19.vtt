00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.800
Are you kind?

2
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.966
You have no chance to regret it now

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.200
Hey

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.400
Mr. Liu

5
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.100
It's me, I'm Xiaoxian

6
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey, yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.033
I'm at the Emperor Hotel now.

8
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.166
I found that

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.000
The ninth-grade Huanyang Dan gathered in your land has been stolen.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.066
Now people are sick

11
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.000
Please bring someone over quickly, I'm right next door.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.233
Coming soon

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.100
Did you hear the boy?

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.933
Mr. Liu will be here in a while

15
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.966
I'll see if you're still stubborn

16
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.833
Fine! I'll wait for him right here.

17
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.166
Who stole the bag from our cloud group?

18
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.000
Mr. Liu, you are finally here

19
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.166
This is the kid who stole 9 bottles of white sheep eggs

20
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.466
Now people are sick

21
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.366
They can't make a fuss

22
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.633
It is indeed the ninth-grade Huanyang Dan of our Diyun Group.

23
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.066
Boy, you stole it

24
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.666
Liu Changjiang

25
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.400
So brave

26
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.666
Go back and ask Piaoxue

27
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.000
Who am I?

28
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.600
You don't want to die, do you?

29
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.900
Ah, why are you so impatient to talk to Lord Liu?

30
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.033
I'll ask Lord Piaoxue

31
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.000
What are you?

32
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.800
People from your Diyun Group

33
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.366
This is how I usually frame others outside

34
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.033
Arrogant and domineering?

35
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.200
Exactly.

36
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.266
Our cloud group is like this outside.

37
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.500
This

38
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.433
Is power

39
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:45.666
kid

40
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.600
We, Mr. Liu, can kill you with just one word

41
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.966
Hahaha

42
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.500
unexpected

43
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.500
The Earth Cloud Group has even produced a scum like you

44
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.466
I'm too lazy to talk nonsense with you.

45
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.433
Hand it over quickly

46
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.300
If I don't pay
