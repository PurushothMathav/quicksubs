00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.266
kneel down

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.400
shopkeeper

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.800
The subordinates also loaded the lightning and grabbed it to see you

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.600
shopkeeper

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.000
Who is it?

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.800
shopkeeper

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.100
You and I are brothers whose blood is thicker than water

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.500
You... you can't kill me

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.600
You can't kill me!

10
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.433
You are sinful

11
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.866
No one can save you

12
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.466
Pull Shen Tian to the entrance of the dragon shop

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.300
No, no.

14
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.533
Give me another chance.

15
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.200
Give me another chance.

16
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.166
Shen Yan thank you

17
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.333
Thanks to you for saving me.

18
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.000
But what surprised me the most was

19
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.066
You are actually the owner of the dragon shop

20
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.666
It seems that grandpa really didn't read Wandy wrong back then.

21
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.500
It was too hasty before

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.233
In front of everyone today

23
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.466
I want to formally propose to you

24
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.400
Rest of Life

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.666
I would like to protect you for me

26
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.066
Hey Shen Yan

27
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.833
When I was arrested, they called you lecherous

28
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.800
There are 100 wives

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.866
It's really who is who who is lying about me

30
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.033
You better be honest with me

31
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.166
Really, just you.

32
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.300
That you have absolutely no second person
