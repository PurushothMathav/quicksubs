00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.866
You must find Wanting

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.133
We offer Wanting

4
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.400
That is also a great credit to our Ye family.

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.100
I hope the owner will help the Ye family a lot in the future

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.766
The owner is going to find Ye Wanting during the summer vacation

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.600
The owner has one more thing to deal with.

Shen Yan is a wolf with ambition

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.033
How dare you impersonate the owner?

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.766
Ask the owner to be discerning

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.333
Qin Chong, you have a special affairs passport

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.866
I can't touch you.

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.100
But what about you, Shen Yan?

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.666
Disrupt the order of the venue

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.566
I will destroy your stench for the Dragon Palace today

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:40.666
Hmph, you're in such a hurry, get out

17
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.766
What are you doing?

18
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:44.866
Let go of Mr. Shen

19
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.533
What are you doing? Shut your mouth, old man

20
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.700
Your shit eyes

21
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.866
Are you so anxious for others?

22
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:52.866
green onion

23
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm Mr. Shen's woman now

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.266
How dare you hit me?

25
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.733
Didn't you hear what Lord Piaoxue said?

26
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.266
Will protect me

27
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.366
No matter how powerful he is

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.800
Is the Dragon Palace amazing?

29
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.200
What are you doing?

30
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.900
Be quick!

31
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.433
Do you want to let me down?

32
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.866
Ah put the car away

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.300
The mountain always saves me

34
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.300
Stop laughing.

35
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.366
You, Mr. Shen, may not be able to protect yourself

36
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:21.500
Mr. Shen
