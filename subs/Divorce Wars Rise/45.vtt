2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.533
I'm sure everyone is for this lot

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:08.300
Then came the Nancheng land contract

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.333
I heard recently

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.900
Diyun Group is preparing to plan land in Nancheng

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.966
Develop Entertainment City

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.466
If anyone owns this land

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.900
I believe in the later benefits

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.300
Is extremely impressive

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.900
Whoever wins this contract

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:22.966
You can get it.

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.733
Opportunity to cooperate with Diyuan Group?

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.466
Yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.566
Opportunity is rare

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.133
However, Rendiyuan Group

16
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.666
No real news was released

17
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.500
In case this land is not developed

18
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.033
Then this land will fall into the hands

19
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.366
Okay, okay.

20
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.366
Not much to say

21
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.600
South Korean land auction starts now

22
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.366
The starting price is 100 million

23
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.400
Five billion, 10 billion.

24
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.100
2 billion 3 billion

25
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.366
3 billion zero

26
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.866
The Ye family is really unruly

27
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.866
Let a piece of trash fall here to haggle

28
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.566
One more piece than others every time

29
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.433
It's embarrassing

30
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.500
I just bid more than you.

31
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.766
Can you do it? You 5 billion

32
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.100
10 billion 15 billion

33
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:12.400
20 billion the cost of this land is 100 million

34
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.300
The industrialist is so promising

35
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.866
Looks like it's true 30 billion
