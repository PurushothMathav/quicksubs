00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.100
200 million, this young master Qin made a move

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.100
It seems that this calmness must be in the bag of the Qin family

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.066
Qin Shao is really generous

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.600
200 million time

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.500
300 million

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.166
How dare you snatch it from Young Master Qin?

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.366
How brave!

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.633
I just don't know if I have the financial resources of the Qin family

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.666
Goddamn thing

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.900
So arrogant

11
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.100
Don't you forget what we're here for

12
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.633
What kind of money is wasted on this kind of garbage boat auction?

13
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.100
The founding knife of the building

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.000
Not just antiques but history

15
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.566
How can someone with ulterior motives take it?

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.966
A soft rice eater actually cares about a hero here

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.100
You save some poison gas in the back

18
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.433
Dad, he had to invite me

19
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.666
Our whole family should have this strength

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.866
350 million

21
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.433
360 million

22
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.900
400 million Qin Shao is worthy of being born into a noble family

23
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.333
It's a foregone conclusion

24
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.500
Take it easy, the price has been capped.

25
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.033
Aren't you crazy?

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.366
Go crazy

27
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.400
See, this is the strength of our Qin family

28
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.600
Hahaha

29
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.466
Your Qin family is indeed wealthy.

30
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.533
1 billion

31
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.766
Goddamn thing

32
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.400
We industrialists don't have a billion dollars to let you buy a toy.

33
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.600
Shen Yan, is 1 billion too much?

34
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.933
Okay 1 billion once

35
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.700
What a silly boy

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.433
You 30 billion

37
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.466
And take out 1 billion to buy a broken knife

38
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.500
1 billion twice

39
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.766
1 billion three times

40
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:36.866
It's a deal!

41
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.866
Congratulations to Mr. Shen

42
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.700
Mr. Shen, please come to the stage to pick you up.

43
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.100
Items bought

44
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.366
It's just an appetizer.

45
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.033
Our Qin family still doesn't look down on this kind of garbage

46
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.866
Treasures of Great Summer

47
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.366
In fact, short-sighted people can understand
