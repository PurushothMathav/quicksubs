00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.366
How can I teach you?

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.400
Don't quarrel with my client.

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.200
Do you want to scare them all away?

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.333
Ouch.

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.266
Mr. Jiang, come to see the house

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.966
I said, Sun.

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.800
How bad is your security?

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.400
Take a look.

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.266
Let this mad dog out and bite people everywhere

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.800
And this is...

11
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.500
Yo guy

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.000
The stench of poverty

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.966
What about the security guard, throw this poor force out for me?

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.466
Supervisor Sun, this is my friend who came to buy a house.

15
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.766
Hahaha, your friend?

16
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.766
Haha, that's just right.

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Pack the three of you up and throw it out

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
Your house sales are so bad

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.900
I kindly teach you how to eat with customers

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.566
Drink and then sleep

21
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.100
Isn't that house sold?

22
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.233
But you haven't sold a house yet.

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.433
One came back from the United States

24
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.966
What are you pretending to be?

25
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.200
Who said he was selling?

26
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.233
We're going to buy it now

27
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.700
Come on, show us the house

28
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.266
I said this beautiful woman

29
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.366
It's not that I look down on you

30
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.900
Our Lingyun room

31
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.400
This one has to be at least 50 million.

32
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.866
You are not even qualified to watch

33
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.166
Manager Sun

34
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.633
Is that so?

35
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.366
I place an order today.

36
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.433
Immediately buy a big villa for this beautiful woman

37
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.166
Who says I can't afford it?

38
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.966
I'm going to take you now

39
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.600
All existing houses are bought
