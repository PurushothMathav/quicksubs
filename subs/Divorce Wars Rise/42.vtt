1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.566
It's true.

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.866
Of course it's true.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.600
You see I also took pictures of the internal contract

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.100
There is also the seal of Diyun Group on it

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.733
If you really let the night court

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.833
Got the land development right in Nancheng

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.700
Collaboration with Earth Cloud

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.166
After that, the Qin family was in Jiangcheng

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.433
Forever suppressed by the Ye family

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.966
All right.

11
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.833
But your Ye family has just passed the crisis

12
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.266
The bride price should not be comparable to our in-laws

13
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.566
Of course.

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.266
I heard that this time Shen Yan can only take out 30 billion

15
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.166
30 billion Yeah

16
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.400
The land in Nancheng belongs to me this time

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.200
Of course, yeah.

18
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.500
Master Shen, come here quickly

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.100
The auction's about to start, right?

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.133
Just waiting for you.

21
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.000
Dad and Wanrong have already gone in.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.866
Smiled

23
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.900
I didn't expect that.

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.833
With the strength of your Ye family

25
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.700
Dare to bid on this male lead

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.500
Apprentice, how much money do you have in your pocket?

27
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.133
How much money do I have in my pocket?

28
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.633
You'll know when we go to the auction.

29
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.600
Don't be too complacent, Qin Chong

30
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:26.000
Okay, then I'll wait and see how you wait.

31
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.566
And the same problem as you?

32
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.200
Looks really good

33
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:31.866
But

34
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.133
Why are you looking for this useless trash?

35
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.600
You said if you had followed me earlier

36
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.666
Your Ye family is not in this position now.

37
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:38.766
I was dreaming.

38
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.700
It's impossible to hang out with you

39
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.566
It's too late now.

40
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.666
Even if you kneel down now and beg to marry into our Qin family

41
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:48.000
I can't possibly want it now.

42
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.400
But you treat me like a plaything

43
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.500
Or can you say one more thing?

44
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300
I hit you begging for mercy, believe it or not

45
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.566
Forget it, don't follow my wife

46
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:58.866
Let's go, it's not that you're playing a trick.

47
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.666
I'll see how I crush you later
