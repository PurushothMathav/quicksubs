00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.720
Dear, what effect do you mean?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.180
How do I notify which mobile phone has been delivered in three years?

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.480
Oops, what is this for? Your life!

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.620
Forgive me for analyzing Xinjiang, which was managed for more than ten years.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.840
Dear, what did you say back then?

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.620
Because of you, I donâ€™t know if it was you who gave birth to it. What will cover it?

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.820
Okay, I, you are, you are the prince.

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960
Miss, you are so convinced,

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.610
This is just confusing Tai!

10
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.770
It's only been a month or so, it's so close!

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.760
But you took over Dong Zhan for a lifetime

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.300
My whole life Dong Zhan

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.180
So let him be a human being

14
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.080
I just found out today

15
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.960
When the year comes and a woman becomes a man,

16
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.640
That's the housewife

17
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.880
It's you now

18
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.190
Only one money

19
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.910
The youngest son

20
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.930
Don't care about your identity

21
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.110
No wonder I turned around first

22
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.730
There is a feeling that wants news

23
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.030
How many days have I really known that I was wrong? Where did you give the answer?

24
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.940
I was taken away by the secretary

25
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.780
If you were wrong again then

26
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.520
Then there is no difference and you picked it up wrong

27
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.300
I miss you buddy

28
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.600
But we should light the fire

29
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.900
Didn't come back today

30
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.340
You hurry up and go out with me this time.

31
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
Don't let him be a girl like Mori

32
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.870
So get up quickly and feed

33
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.060
thank you thank you

34
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.750
You've worked hard for me, don't work hard.

35
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.690
Thank you for your forgiveness. Let's go.

36
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.190
Let's go find this person and say goodbye

37
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.260
Your side is coming back twice. Stop and go.
