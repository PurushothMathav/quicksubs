00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:10.866
This

2
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.300
Sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.566
How do you dawdle, little girl?

4
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.400
Do you still want this list?

5
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.400
A little bit bigger.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.633
Hand my hand

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.066
Ah, what's easy to pack with a shrunken one?

8
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.066
Stop stealing

9
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.300
Stop

10
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.500
What's up?

11
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.633
Get the medicine cabinet

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.666
Thank you uncle what's the matter

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.000
He didn't seem to recognize me.

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.133
Mr. Ji doesn't care about me

15
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.700
He fell by himself.

16
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.800
Let him clean up

17
00:00:59.466 --> 00:00:59.966
Mr. Ji

18
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.433
Mr. Ji, I was wrong, please go, please don't fire me

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.166
Have I seen him somewhere?

20
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.866
I'll do it myself

21
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.300
Are you all right?

22
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:34.900
Yeah.

23
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.166
Uncle, thank you.

24
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:50.666
I'm in pain.

25
00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.900
Call me if you need it.

26
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:01.200
I'll get busy first

27
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.233
But you haven't told me yet.

28
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.300
The water sent by your company in the future

29
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.033
We offer double the price.

30
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.866
Great baby

31
00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:20.900
Mom will be able to support you in the future

32
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.466
You remember me

33
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.400
Why did you let me go? Don't you two know each other?

34
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.866
How come?
