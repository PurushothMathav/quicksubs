00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.800
Ah!

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.166
Your room is on the far left of the second floor.

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.400
The housework at home is done by a chair

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.166
Let him get what he needs and wants to eat

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.266
If you travel, let Li Shu give it to you.

6
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.866
The biggest task now is to heal well

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.100
Take good care

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.600
Take good care of yourself

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.666
Well, I'll take you on a journey later.

10
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.000
This is your room

11
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.800
Do you like this arrangement?

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.366
If you don't like it, you can change it again.

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.066
I like it very much.

14
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.733
Thank you, uncle.

15
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.700
The one opposite is my bedroom.

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.400
This is my study

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.266
I usually work in the study

18
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.300
You can contact me if you have anything.

19
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.000
Um, OK.

20
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.966
Ah, wait for me.

21
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.866
The room is so cozy

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.766
Why does it feel like the uncle knows that I'm coming back?

23
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.533
That thing

24
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.266
I have investigated it clearly.

25
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.766
It's okay, I've long forgotten

26
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.366
Even if you forget

27
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.200
Should you pay back your innocence or should you pay back your innocence?

28
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.800
only

29
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.633
A little late

30
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.000
I thought...

31
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.633
I will never get my song back

32
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.300
uncle

33
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:36.766
Thanks.

34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.400
you

35
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.433
The goose maze is beautiful

36
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.800
Romantic flowers should have
