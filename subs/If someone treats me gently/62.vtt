00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.866
Now it's all within control

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.100
You have to believe that I have the ability to solve problems

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.700
Uncle, in fact, you don't have to worry

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.266
The children are all on themselves

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.466
I can help you.

6
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.733
I also have a certain number of fans now

7
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.333
I can forward the statement for you.

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.200
Maybe it can turn things around

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.000
you

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.900
What are you laughing at?

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm laughing.

12
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.700
Why am I so cute?

13
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.033
Such a good Sun size is very lucky.

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.900
I met you too

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.866
Don't worry.

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.100
Even if it is not timely, there will be a solution.

17
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.766
Mr. Ji has since privately and forwarded the company's public relations

18
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.000
After the clarification announcement

19
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.900
Online sentiment is no longer one-sided

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.633
Although many people are scolding the timing

21
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.900
But there are a lot of people who are maintaining the timing situation

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.066
There is also an early guarantee transfer.

23
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.300
But most are still in the wait-and-see stage

24
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.100
I want to see how we deal with the timing.

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.966
That would be fine.
