00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.333
Mr. Ji just broke a lot of news online

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.200
The flag of a music company

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.166
The next batch of artists and singers

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.333
Now both the music company market share price has plummeted

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.300
The head office has also been affected to a certain extent

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.366
Mr. Ji, what should we do?

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.766
Let the public relations department suppress the hot search first

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.266
The PR department is already in custody

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.433
But the topic trendiness is rising too fast

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.133
I feel like someone is behind the hype

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.033
The person behind it has been investigated

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.966
And

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.666
Is the confirmation information true?

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.966
Don't owe Mr. Ji

15
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.700
It happened too suddenly

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.833
I haven't found out who is behind it yet.

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.766
But now the only certainty is

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.000
Some of these gangs are real and some are fake

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.400
true or false

20
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.800
Since it is true

21
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.733
Then there will be a lot of subconscious questions

22
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.966
All the black stuff is real

23
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.733
Then first confirm which ones are true

24
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.766
Which ones are fake?

25
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.866
Understood Mr. Ji

26
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.600
What should Mr. Ji do now?

27
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.866
The country is about to drop by the limit.

28
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.200
Issue a statement first

29
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.566
show

30
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.600
Our company will continue to follow up and investigate this matter.

31
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.233
If it is true

32
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.866
We will punish the corresponding violators.

33
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.700
If it is fake

34
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.766
We will also take legal weapons

35
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.300
Yeah, spreading rumors.

36
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.266
Those who caused losses to Shaus will be held accountable

37
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.433
Keep the PR department ready at all times

38
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.566
Got it, yeah.

39
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.066
Still need to investigate

40
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.800
Who leaked a person's whereabouts?

41
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.900
This person should still be in the company

42
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.100
That's him!
