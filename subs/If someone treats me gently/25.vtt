00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.633
What do you say, old man?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:06.166
Damn Xiaoxiao, you damn girl, I don't know where you went

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.300
Ouch, I'm fine, parents.

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.566
250,000 we can still get our hands on it

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.000
I heard that the kid of the Zhou family offended the people on the road

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.600
Kicked out of Kyoto

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.666
Then we don't have to pay back the 250,000

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.833
Yes, my son is still smart.

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.300
enter

10
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:31.866
master

11
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.300
What's up?

12
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.366
Are you uncomfortable?

13
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.466
Not really. No, actually.

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.766
It's just that I think these days

15
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.900
I was a little too idle.

16
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.366
I want to go out and look for a job.

17
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.300
I'm not happy

18
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.233
No, of course not, very happy

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.833
It's just that my uncle and I flew together after all.

20
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.166
Look, I eat and drink for free at your house every day

21
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.966
Then I feel a little sorry in my heart

22
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.666
Don't feel embarrassed.

23
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.833
You just live here

24
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.600
You're not completely in good health now

25
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.966
We'll discuss it after you take good care of it.

26
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.533
No, uncle, I know you are doing it for me.

27
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.700
But look.

28
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.566
I'm alive and kicking

29
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.566
Will you let me out?

30
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.600
Okay, but

31
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.600
In your current physical condition

32
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.233
That kind of manual work can no longer be done.

33
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:27.533
This

34
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.066
It's not what you girls should do

35
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.800
And easy to find by your parents

36
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.433
You are right

37
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.266
Interested in songwriting

38
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.300
We are both music

39
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.866
It is second to none in the country

40
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.733
Are you interested?

41
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.533
technician

42
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.900
Can I really go to Technician Music Company to study?

43
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.033
Ah!

44
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:58.166
Uncle, you are too kind, thank you uncle.
