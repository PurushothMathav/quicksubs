1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.600
I didn't expect my brother to collapse

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.133
There is also my brother, woohoo

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.566
This must be fake. My brother is so good

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.766
Brain fan upstairs

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.800
Fight fans like this

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.566
Sitting and waiting for the evidence to remember, this is offending, right?

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.300
It's like whitening agent upstairs, right?

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.000
Get out of my god

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.700
Technician, so many people exploded this time

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.700
I will never dare to follow a technician's artist again

11
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.666
Is a technician a garbage dump?

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.100
So many abusive artists

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.400
I don't know how the uncle is.

14
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.533
Do you know who it is?

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.133
Mr. Ji, I found out during the investigation

16
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.733
Someone whispered in private

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.400
Even if part of the music company's surveillance

18
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.133
what do you look like?

19
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.800
Although the office surveillance is broken

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.166
But the surveillance in the corridor is good

21
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.333
A monitor around the corner

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.166
Four small offices just right across the street

23
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.066
It recorded everything that happened

24
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.833
We enjoy character comparison

25
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
Found out to be the head of the clothing department

26
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.200
Logically speaking

27
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.933
He has no reason to frame the villain

28
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.433
Call the police directly

29
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.966
Should know the answer right away
