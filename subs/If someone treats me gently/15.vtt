00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.600
Mom, what's the matter with you?

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200
Oh, think about it, I'm fine to call you back

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.800
I want to tell you a great happy event

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.100
What good things will you tell me?

5
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.266
Say what's the matter

6
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.866
We promise for you

7
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.500
A very good marriage. What about that person?

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.066
Also you know

9
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.200
It's Xiao Zhou next door to us.

10
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.266
Zhou Jinyan, he came to mention his dear

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.700
Don't you like him too?

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.900
Ah I don't marry

13
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.800
Mom, what are you doing?

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.333
Oh, little one.

15
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.700
Do you just listen to the mother? Just marry the gag

16
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.766
Mom

17
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.200
Don't push my mom

18
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.933
I don't want to marry him.

19
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.900
I don't want to marry

20
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.766
If you don't marry him, I'll die for you to see.

21
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.900
Don't get excited

22
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.600
Put the scissors down

23
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.433
So I won't force you to marry Jinyan immediately

24
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:09.166
Let's try to get along with each other first

25
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:10.666
Ah!

26
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.066
I don't live anymore

27
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.000
I promise you.

28
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.700
I promise you, okay?

29
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.066
Impossible to let go

30
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.766
Little one, what about us?

31
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.100
I've already made an appointment for you for a drink.

32
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.600
Let's go out on a date now

33
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.166
Okay, go, go, go, go

34
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.866
It turns out that he already has someone he likes

35
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.400
Mr. Ji, are we still going?

36
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.266
Let's go let's go
