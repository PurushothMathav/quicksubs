00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.700
Si Xiaoxiao, don't blame me for being cruel

2
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.833
Blame it on you for offending someone you shouldn't have offended

3
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.900
Don't be afraid

4
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.433
It's me, your brother

5
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.000
Don't say anything

6
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.233
Don't do this.

7
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.600
Si Xiaoxiao, how many times have I said it?

8
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.700
You just won't?

9
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.800
It's not in my hands yet.

10
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.400
Sooner or later you have to marry me

11
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.500
What if you give it to me now?

12
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.766
Ah, anyone there?

13
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.566
Anyone help

14
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.233
Shout louder

15
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.366
If you scream your throat, no one will come to your rescue.

16
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.066
But I advise you

17
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.133
Or shout softer to save your energy

18
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.800
Otherwise, I won't have the strength to shout later.

19
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.566
Didn't we grow up together?

20
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:15.033
You see, I'm going to marry you sooner or later

21
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.233
Why are you in a hurry?

22
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.633
Right? Marry me?

23
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.000
Since you want to marry me

24
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.566
Why did you run that day?

25
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.400
If it weren't for you running away

26
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
Will I be beaten up by the smashing single person in love?

27
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.266
Uh bitch

28
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.266
I wouldn't.

29
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.166
Let you go.

30
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.700
It's his own

31
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.266
You want revenge

32
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:46.100
Are you going to find him?

33
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.800
What do you want from me?

34
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.000
If you hadn't run away that day

35
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600
I wouldn't have suffered this.

36
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.466
So all this

37
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.966
It's all your fault, it's all your fault, it's all your fault, it's all your fault

38
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.066
But

39
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.700
Soon you will be mine

40
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.433
I have a way
