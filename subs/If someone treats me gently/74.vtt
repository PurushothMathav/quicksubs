00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.466
Brother, what's the matter?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.800
What's wrong?

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.000
Xiaolu, you go abroad immediately

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.866
Don't come back for now.

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.300
I've already booked your ticket

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.466
Brother, what's wrong?

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.466
Xiaolu, listen to my brother

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.566
You go abroad first

9
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.966
Don't come back for now.

10
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.633
I'm not leaving

11
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.800
Brother Yuanyang is still here

12
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm leaving now.

13
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.900
Didn't you just give him to that woman?

14
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.033
I do not

15
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.466
Xiaoru

16
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.300
Didn't you listen to your brother the most?

17
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.766
Listen to me

18
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.233
You go abroad first

19
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.233
Brother has prepared enough funds for you.

20
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.866
Enough for you to squander for a lifetime

21
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.900
If brother wins

22
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.366
Brother will pick you up

23
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.066
If my brother loses this time

24
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.200
You stay abroad

25
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.700
Never come back

26
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.866
Let's face it together, okay?

27
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.500
You haven't listened to your brother the most since you were a child

28
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.233
Come hello

29
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.700
Come on.

30
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.000
Xiao Zhou

31
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.600
Go ahead.

32
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.766
Brother, I'm leaving.

33
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.966
You have to take care of yourself

34
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.833
Brother, I know something must have happened to our family

35
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.500
I want to help you.

36
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.700
But I do.

37
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.233
I'm sure I'll be a burden to you if I stay here

38
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.533
Brother, I'm leaving first

39
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:36.866
You must be well

40
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.233
You must remember to pick me up.
