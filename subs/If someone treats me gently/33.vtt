00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.500
It's him. That's him.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.800
He must have done it.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.800
He has only been in the company for a few days, how could he have done it?

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.100
I hope you don't point fingers at him for doing it.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.866
The company was fine before

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.500
Why did such a big thing happen to the company when he came?

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.666
These are nothing more than personal conjectures

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.500
We speak on evidence

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.500
You are responsible for what you say

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.566
Brother Wrongful, how do you know he has no evidence?

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.666
Don't be afraid to speak up

12
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.500
Wrongful brother is the most fair

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.900
Mr. Ji, I dare to say so, of course there is evidence

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.700
One day when I came out of the bathroom

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.066
I heard Si Xiaoxiao talking on the phone in the corner

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.933
He seems to be talking about someone's whereabouts

17
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.366
What exposure or something

18
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.533
Later, I asked Director Zhou to confirm.

19
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.766
Director Zhou said

20
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.733
Si Xiaoxiao

21
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.433
I actually went to him to see the whereabouts of the artist

22
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.566
Right, Director Zhou, I'm not lying, am I?

23
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.200
Si Xiaoxiao has indeed seen the artist's itinerary

24
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.866
But that doesn't mean he spread it.

25
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.466
In the company

26
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.300
Can everyone see that file?
