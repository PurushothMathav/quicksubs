00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.300
What's the noise?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.100
i

3
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.800
Just ask this newcomer to make me a cup of coffee

4
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.666
Just coffee

5
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.133
This is what it looks like.

6
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.300
This is Mr. Ji who came in

7
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.166
Talented or not

8
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.033
Don't offend

9
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.300
You want to drink coffee and make it yourself?

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.233
And you, you go to the bathroom to clean up

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.100
It's over, work

12
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.700
Hmph, I will look good on you in the future.

13
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.266
New here, I heard you've written songs before

14
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.366
This project is handed over to you.

15
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.333
Let me tell you something.

16
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.033
The above is very serious about this project

17
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.666
You better work hard.

18
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.833
Ah, Supervisor Qin actually gave you this project

19
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.233
It seems that I want to embarrass you.

20
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.400
Hello, is there anything wrong with this project?

21
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.800
You may not know it when you first arrived.

22
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.533
The POC of this project?

23
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.866
Very picky

24
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.100
Several versions of the song submitted before were rejected

25
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.000
Now this project is a hot potato.

26
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.800
It stands to reason that you just started

27
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.033
It shouldn't be your turn to handle this kind of project

28
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:13.866
I guess.

29
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.266
It's because you just offended Xu Yan this morning

30
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.900
He avenged his little lover, thank you.

31
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.200
This project did have a certain level of difficulty

32
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:30.800
But

33
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.100
I have promised the uncle to work hard.

34
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.633
Of course you can't give up easily
