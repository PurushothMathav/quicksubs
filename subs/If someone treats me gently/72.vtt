00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:09.966
uncle

2
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.266
Little, little, little

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.866
What happened to Xiaoxiao

4
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.000
It's alright

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.500
It's alright

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.066
What's wrong?

7
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:32.300
The car you went back in today had an accident.

8
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.200
Fortunately, you weren't in a car accident.

9
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.000
Miss 4, what's the matter with you?

10
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.400
My stomach hurts.

11
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.433
Why don't I take you to the hospital first?

12
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.400
You're fine, you go to the park to get the documents

13
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.766
I'll just go to the hospital by myself

14
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.666
Can you do it alone?

15
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.300
Yes, it's alright.

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.400
I was going to take that car

17
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.066
But as soon as I got in the car I felt a stomachache

18
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.266
Then I came to the hospital by myself

19
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.700
Maybe the baby feels that his mother is in danger.

20
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.666
You saved your mother's life before you were born

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.033
But

22
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.566
Why are they that person's children?

23
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.300
If only he were my child
