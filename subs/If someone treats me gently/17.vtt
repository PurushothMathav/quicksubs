00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:04.900
Smile, you can stay at home and wait for marriage recently

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.866
Which wild man did you call?

3
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.466
Give me back my phone

4
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.900
I said why didn't you go home every day before?

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.100
Hooking up wild men outside, right?

6
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:19.966
I'll let you out.

7
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.700
I let you go

8
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.600
I let you roll

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.466
Okay, okay.

10
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.000
They're getting married in two days

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.833
Let his in-laws see his injuries

12
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.100
It doesn't look good either

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.300
If you weren't getting married in a few days

14
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.700
I will never let you go.

15
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:43.900
Damn girl, don't be shameless.

16
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.333
That dowry is for your brother's wife

17
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.866
Don't even think about it.

18
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.500
Let you marry honestly

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.266
Otherwise, there is your color for you to see.

20
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.966
Mom

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.100
Brother is your child

22
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.066
Am I not?

23
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:11.200
Why do you do this to monsters?

24
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.566
Blame you for being a woman. Go

25
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.566
Stay inside and reflect

26
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.366
Obediently waiting to get married

27
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.033
Can you open the door?

28
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.500
Don't do this

29
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.066
What are you eating?

30
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:43.600
What are you eating? I've been working so hard
