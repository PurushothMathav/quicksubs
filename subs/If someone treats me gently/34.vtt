1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.600
But that doesn't mean he spread it.

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.166
In the company

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.766
Can everyone see that file?

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.833
Yes, he is not the only one who has seen it.

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.833
But his deal is the biggest

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:13.500
I suggest that Si Xiaoxiao stop investigating first

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.366
Speak with evidence

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.900
I can't rely on your words alone

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.266
Suspend him

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.766
dysfunction

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.233
What's wrong with Mr. Ji?

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.266
The message was sent from your computer

13
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:37.000
The Internet Protocol Address is also displayed on your computer

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.366
about this

15
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.033
What do you have to explain?

16
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.166
No. How could I possibly do such a thing?

17
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.166
And isn't there surveillance in the office area?

18
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.366
Just call up the monitor

19
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.100
To prove my innocence

20
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.600
I said it was you

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.766
You still don't admit it

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.333
Knowing that the monitoring was broken two days ago

23
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.600
You also said to adjust the monitoring.

24
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.866
I see you.

25
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.466
Just to escape responsibility

26
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.500
I didn't if it was really me

27
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.166
Then I will naturally take responsibility.

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.033
But this really has nothing to do with me.

29
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.566
little

30
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.066
So you go back and rest for a few days first.

31
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.600
Wait until I find out the truth

32
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.166
Preserve your innocence

33
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.200
You trust me.

34
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.500
I believe you.
