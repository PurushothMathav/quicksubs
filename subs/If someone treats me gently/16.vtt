00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.200
Help me investigate this one called Si Xiaoxiao

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.400
I want to know all about him

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.700
Ok Mr. Ji

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.266
Mr. Ji

5
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.433
This is the result of a small personal investigation into the company

6
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.466
Si Xiaoxiao is 22 years old

7
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.700
After graduating from high school, the parents reorganized their family

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.866
He also has an older brother

9
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.266
Parents prefer boys to girls

10
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.333
His house has a Matsuhui station

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.266
He also has a group of Wang fried since he was a child

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.600
Childhood sweetheart boyfriend

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.766
It is said that the two have a good relationship

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.966
One day he already has something he likes

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.900
I thought she was going to be our CEO's wife

16
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.933
I didn't expect that they already have a boyfriend

17
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.566
She's pregnant with someone else's child

18
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.700
Oh, smile.

19
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
How was your day with Shinyan?

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.666
Have you changed your mind?

21
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.833
Not much.

22
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.633
I will not marry Jay Chou

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.866
What do you want if you don't marry Zhou Jie?

24
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.800
Do you know what he did?

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.000
You don't care what he did

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.266
Even if you die, you will marry Zhou Jie

27
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.900
I won't marry oops

28
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.666
Xiaoxiao, don't be ambitious with your father

29
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.733
He's doing it for your own good too

30
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.033
Good for me

31
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.366
Can you ignore my opinion for my own good?

32
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.933
If you are really good for me

33
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.700
You should return the 250,000's dowry to him

34
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.633
Cancel this marriage

35
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What happened to 250,000 we raised you so much?

36
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.466
Besides, the boss is getting married soon

37
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.766
What happened to your out-point power as his sister?

38
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.933
Just because my eldest brother is getting married

39
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:39.066
Are you going to sell me to such a beast?

40
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.066
Do you think he is still human?

41
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.700
Damn girl, I told you you were raised by me

42
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700
Who am I asking you to marry?

43
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.900
You have to marry me honestly

44
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.233
Wow! What are you doing?
