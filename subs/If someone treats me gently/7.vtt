00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.200
That's my dog.

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.600
Who is that?

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.400
Don't you know this is my exclusive music room?

4
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.633
Go away

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.533
This song? Where did this song come from?

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.133
You tell me where it came from.

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.733
Crazy lunatic get out of the way

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.566
Go away, what are you still doing?

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.300
Quickly pull him away for me

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.166
How dare you hurt me

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.300
I let you walk around

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.433
Where did the lyrics to this song come from?

13
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.166
Of course I wrote my songs

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
Besides, why should I tell you?

15
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.233
You wrote it.

16
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.866
This is obviously what I wrote

17
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.300
This is what I wrote.

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.033
Just you, the plumber.

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.133
Do you think anyone will believe you when you write songs?

20
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.566
Hmph, are you going to laugh me to death?

21
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.700
No, no.

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.900
Yeah this is my song

23
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.800
This is obviously my song

24
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.166
You said it was your song

25
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.100
Do you have any evidence?

26
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.900
I have it do you have it
