00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.800
Be obedient

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.100
Mom will protect you.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.800
OK

4
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.166
husband

5
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.266
Why don't you get some food for the dead girl?

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.233
No one can die without starving for a meal or two

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.600
Don't teach him a lesson

8
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.800
He doesn't know.

9
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.366
Eat

10
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.766
Do I really have to wait to look back on the horizon?

11
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.466
Ah!

12
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.066
Mom

13
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.133
I figure it out.

14
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.033
I will marry

15
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.500
I thought very clearly.

16
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.100
I'm going to get married sooner or later anyway

17
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.600
Who is not to marry?

18
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.500
And Zhou and I grew up together

19
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.766
knowledgeable

20
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.600
I'd better marry him than marry someone else

21
00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.833
Mom, I know I was wrong.
