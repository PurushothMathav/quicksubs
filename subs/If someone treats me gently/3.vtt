00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.766
Damn girl came back so late

2
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.766
Do you still want me to cook for you?

3
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.100
There is a door in the pot

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.266
Go get it and eat it yourself

5
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.766
Put the pipe away

6
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.433
Hey, burn the bowl first

7
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.566
Why is it so big that you don't have a long eye?

8
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:51.866
That's okay.

9
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.066
It's okay, Xiao Xiao, don't

10
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.400
Who?

11
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.400
Oh dear

12
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.933
You said you came here

13
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.433
Why are you still buying so many things?

14
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.566
Please sit down

15
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.066
Uncle aunt

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.400
200,000 dowry. I'm ready

17
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.033
Today I'm here to propose to Xiaoxiao

18
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.866
200,000 aunt turned

19
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.400
You get married right away

20
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.466
Get married soon

21
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.333
My dowry has been paid

22
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.400
Mom, I don't want to marry him.

23
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.466
You can't marry me to him

24
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.200
He's a beast

25
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.833
Do you know how this 200,000 came about?

26
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.766
He sold me.

27
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.100
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

28
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.000
Sold it to his brother

29
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.833
Sell him once brother

30
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.633
200,000, Sixiao

31
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.366
As long as your broken brother is worth 200,000

32
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.500
Even if it 200,000

33
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.200
That was also Xiao Zhou who answered the relationship.

34
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.233
Auntie, things have changed, Xiaoxiao

35
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:35.900
I won't dislike you because of what happened yesterday

36
00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:39.300
Maybe Mr. Qin will continue to buy your songs

37
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.800
Our good day

38
00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.300
Coming soon.

39
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.766
I will never marry you

40
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.433
Look at me yesterday
