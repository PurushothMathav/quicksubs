00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.200
What are you doing?

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.800
How did it go?

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.666
Can you still stand up?

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.066
Brother Yuan, I didn't mean to

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.033
I don't know what happened to him.

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:12.866
That's him!

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.033
He broke into my exclusive music room

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.200
You came up and grabbed my arm

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.166
I was hurt by him.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.800
Pushed him lightly

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.033
Brother Yuan, you see it's all red

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.600
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.300
No.

14
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:27.866
No.

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.633
I just heard someone singing my song

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.866
Just want to ask me ASAP

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.766
Where did the song come from?

18
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.233
Are you saying I stole your lyrics?

19
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.400
That's funny.

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.966
Me a day later

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.800
I can write a dozen songs casually in a month

22
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.066
Brother Yuan framed me as soon as he came in

23
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.000
You have to call the shots for me

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.966
Don't think I don't know

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.500
Your songs are all copied

26
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.266
Little four little brother

27
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.100
How can you hug another woman?

28
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.066
He's pretending to be dark

29
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.400
Bitch dares to seduce Brother Yuan

30
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.266
Will make you feel better

31
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.866
Go to the hospital

32
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.366
Doctor, how is he?

33
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.100
The patient is currently fine

34
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.400
It could be malnutrition.

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.066
Also slightly hypoglycemic

36
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.533
Previous fainting may have been caused by low blood sugar

37
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.766
Just add more glucose.

38
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.566
Hey, are you family members of the patient?

39
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:57.366
The patient is currently two weeks pregnant. What?
