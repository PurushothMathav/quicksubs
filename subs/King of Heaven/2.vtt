00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.040
Now, why don’t you give up acting?

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.010
Do you know something? People call it Jiangdong stupid name.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.130
As for the entire Jiang table, everyone knows that they are all super considerate and responsible.

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.930
Requesting a review from you, like after putting something in,

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.340
Your boy is helping people in the knowledge car.

6
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.060
He can just let me teach that person a lesson

7
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.950
Let him become the king of learning.

8
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330
Who asked you to deal with me?

9
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.270
Not necessarily

10
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.880
Someone give them a million

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.980
You who asked me to teach you a lesson

12
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.540
I didn’t know you were the king either.

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.040
Not enough people

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.060
I won’t let you make sure with this hand

15
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.180
Since I can leave

16
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.000
King of the road

17
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.300
Yes, Lu Tianlu Tianwang

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.340
After listening to Lu Tianwang

19
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.920
After listening to Lu Tianwang

20
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.980
After listening to Lu Tianwang

21
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.200
After listening to Lu Tianwang

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.280
Ineffective discipline

23
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.180
Please give me God's help

24
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.010
They are also common people of Dianli

25
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.550
My subordinates are also good at the Internet

26
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.170
If you still can't manage it well

27
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.940
You don’t have to join this group in this life anymore.

28
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.420
Normal is your subordinate

29
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.740
He paid someone 1 million to deal with the matter

30
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.320
You send someone to check the new charge

31
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.460
It's not you behind the scenes, is it?

32
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.700
Wait a minute to collect the salt from your grandma

33
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.500
How are you preparing the gift you prepared?

34
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.560
The lost trade I have prepared is also precious.

35
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.480
The value of your gifts

36
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:41.840
You will definitely become a fan.

37
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.520
Net, Net, Net, Net, Net, Net, Net, Net, Net, Net, Net, Net.

38
00:01:45.520 --> 00:02:08.020
Net net net net net net net net.

39
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.420
You were the runner-up and didn’t give up grandma’s birthday cake
