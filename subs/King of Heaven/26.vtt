1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.690
The contract we are talking about seems to have been compared by Ye Hao.

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.490
So all the incoming bids come out,

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.490
The Ye family's plan is the best. If Ye Hesheng doesn't let us compare,

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.770
you're right.

5
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.330
This contract is for me, to move you to me.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.720
Manager Sun, we have also prepared the plan.

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.250
Okay, there is a way.

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.560
Do you know if the group really has one hundred and one contracts?

9
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.980
Able to participate in the bid,

10
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.980
The lowest bass, involved in chocolate, has ten tones,

11
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.700
Even if your plan is better,

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.890
There are four guesses for you here.

13
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.010
Oh, everything is done

14
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.590
The tomb family will not be affected by your actions.

15
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.950
So you have ten meanings

16
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.130
Play your class

17
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.790
The geopolitical situation will be divided into centuries.

18
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.630
You still have one last coincidence, will Wu Man

19
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.290
It was so late when I returned to the tomb house and walked in

20
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.560
Will bring this huge thing to the tomb family

21
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.660
When you were still here as a party student

22
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.080
Do you really think you are an adult?

23
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.060
century hua

24
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.180
He looks at your house

25
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.580
None of them are qualified to enter the bidding by guessing words.

26
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.660
Do this at the bottom of the tomb

27
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.319
Just to let Wan Jin return to the cave and take your place there

28
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.560
You owe me a debt and you didnâ€™t know you were deceived by them, promise?

29
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.560
no matter what you say

30
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.580
My goal is not to lose because of you.

31
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.560
You need far-reaching ability

32
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.860
Just take out the 11 treasures of gold.

33
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.460
Yes sir

34
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.900
if you can't find

35
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.180
Those with a background of third-rate test masters or above are considered inferior

36
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.180
We need you to conduct a self-assessment review

37
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.240
And if you can't come up with a short partition that suits your needs,

38
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.980
You will not be eligible to have a warning
