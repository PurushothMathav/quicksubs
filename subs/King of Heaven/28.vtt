00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.470
Sorry, my brother got the wrong one,

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.920
Are you like this? What?

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.740
This card has three hundred uses, hahaha.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.660
All banks, please put your card away quickly.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.900
Don't ask again. Yesterday, I think there was no need for those people.

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.480
He was just wasting his time. What are the rules?

7
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.760
And produce a synthetic society once?

8
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.040
If not, then yes,

9
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.160
The secret purchase is still six points. This sentence,

10
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.480
Just once in society,

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.620
I don’t believe in the same thing.

12
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.080
Ten pieces each, we Mo Xia took out,

13
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.820
Plane, report back to him.

14
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.280
How about it? Is the review clear? Add some explanation?

15
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.060
Finally, Mr.’s card number is eleven eleven eleven.

16
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.740
How can this run?

17
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.570
He, he is at a loss

18
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.710
Where is eleven?

19
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.050
Did you make a mistake?

20
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.370
I really didn't dig

21
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.990
Show me
