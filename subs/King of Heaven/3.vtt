00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.390
Ten thousand years, I just was really written try try try try try try try try try

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.670
Try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.210
Try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:31.580
Try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it

5
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.740
A surprising selection of gifts

6
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.600
Come and have a look

7
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.580
Thousand years of life

8
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.900
Here is my handout of 800,000

9
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.340
Do you give gifts

10
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.060
He is a strong person who depends on motivation.

11
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.800
Of course, you should pay attention to the thoughtfulness of the gift.

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.760
But it’s a price like yours

13
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.140
There is no feeling except words

14
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.600
I see that's your intention. Don't be in a hurry. That's a good point.

15
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
There are some people here

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.460
Just like the best intentions

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.400
That's better than having a guy

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.530
What did you say

19
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.410
Thousand years of life because of being in the opposition party

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.990
Thousand years old with apricot hair

21
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.510
His body is countless

22
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.569
Anyway, you really are

23
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.390
The longest life span is no more than strength

24
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.330
I don't think this is the former lady at all.

25
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.070
But artificially cultivate you to give up

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.720
This is what I, Hua Ba, are talking about.

27
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.740
My expenses with my school girl

28
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.200
Since you dare to kill my brother

29
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.160
You're a stinky one

30
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.240
What life

31
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060
I don't know how to deal with it just by looking at it.

32
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.760
I looked at him because

33
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.080
I was not prepared for the mist

34
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.570
That’s why I just shouted, there’s a fat one, don’t make any noise, don’t make any noise.

35
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.260
Show me life

36
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.140
I'm talking about life, show me

37
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.970
Why do I want my noodles and fried rice?
