00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.120
I mean really big.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.400
Okay, okay, what you said is really great.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.900
Hello, Mom.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.700
I respect the general’s affirmation from the twenty-sixth family in the four houses.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.600
You have delivered it

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.300
they are not the end of others

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.079
You and Chen Xun

8
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.200
Come back quickly

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.780
OK I got it

10
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.920
The affirmation of four houses and twenty sixty houses

11
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.780
Already delivered

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.160
If Auntie doesn't want to send Mr. Dan away,

13
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.060
I go to Chen Xun’s mission

14
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.240
Are you here to pay?

15
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.060
to me and to him

16
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.259
It's the same

17
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.260
Yes, Chen Xun, let’s go

18
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.200
Chen Xun is the son-in-law of me and my family

19
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.300
Your affirmation

20
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.220
Because of our affirmation

21
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.640
It's the same

22
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.520
I went to find it for sure

23
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.320
This must be us

24
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.200
Just give it to Mr. Chen

25
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.440
There is no need for us to personally teach Mr. Chen, right?

26
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.350
If you don’t personally educate Mr. Chen,

27
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.470
You won't come down either

28
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.610
we can all get up

29
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.050
Last night at the sports meeting

30
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.250
Your solitary general Mr. Chen

31
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.610
The lonely home at your feet

32
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.210
But how much do we teach to grow?

33
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.370
Will it be you?

34
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.850
We can't stand up

35
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.110
This has just passed, sir, where are you today?

36
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.510
It’s our four major families who are treating you, Pailizi

37
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.570
Follow you in every house

38
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.570
Still different from previous years
