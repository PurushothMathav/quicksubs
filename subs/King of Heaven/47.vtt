00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.080
I'm sorry, he and the company have gone to a lot of companies,

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.340
The Han family was in ruins.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.390
You, why are you doing everything?

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.670
You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want.

5
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.230
You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want.

6
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.790
You get whatever you want.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.320
You get whatever you want.

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.320
You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want.

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.060
I'll get you no matter what.

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.640
You get whatever you want. You get whatever you want.

11
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.780
You get whatever you want.

12
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.260
I'll get you no matter what.

13
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.280
I'll get you no matter what.

14
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.280
I'll get you no matter what. I'll get you no matter what. I'll get you no matter what.

15
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.720
I'll get you no matter what.

16
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.210
I'll get you no matter what.

17
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.510
I'll get you no matter what.

18
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.550
I'm used to people's mistakes

19
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.290
Listen to my fate

20
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.090
Can you let the rest of the Han family go?

21
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.090
The red text has something to do with the moon

22
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.150
As long as you and the rest of the Han family

23
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.150
Don't come to cause trouble

24
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.050
Of course I won't eat it in front of you

25
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.060
Studying is in vain

26
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.760
Calculate the time

27
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.640
You should have already received a fee

28
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.300
Since that expense

29
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.320
The most absolute is our final so-called conclusion

30
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.300
Then choose again and donâ€™t choose again.

31
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.490
What does it cost?

32
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.410
Auntie got wet and saved

33
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.390
Descendants of the Han family

34
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.030
Already selected

35
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.100
What did you say in the center?
