00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.140
Go ahead, since you said so, I'll let you in too.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.400
Now go back to Ketou and buy it for me.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.130
Then I can also take the language test and surpass you,

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.930
Is it a poem close to the heart?

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.000
I have the final say now.

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.210
Flight sister, don’t say that your sister didn’t help you.

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.550
If I could meet you now,

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.350
If not, we can still ask you.

9
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.830
But if you fall in love with someone new, it would be better if you don't know the truth.

10
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.730
Then don't change your approach to being a younger sister.

11
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.620
Clear water, that's where we'll get up in a moment, let's walk through us today.

12
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.440
Just a word later

13
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.380
We do our job

14
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.780
I'm asking for forgiveness for you.

15
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990
I'm the one to blame

16
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.100
You really don't know how to die

17
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.680
Do you think it will be easier to become Sister Tang now?

18
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.660
Tell me about you

19
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.840
I'm pregnant, I have a baby, I'm capable, but I, he

20
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.080
Go and open people's eyes

21
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.520
No blind person has ever checked it

22
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.980
When did this happen?

23
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.720
You are still giving up on his brother's clean Chen Xue

24
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.840
Do you really think you are an adult like me?

25
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.320
What's our identity?

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.620
Don't dare to move after hearing this.

27
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.620
Why don't you want to say that?

28
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.760
What if this expense

29
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.840
What is the identity of Yanzang?

30
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.220
It turns out that if you don’t know me, then

31
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.460
You've learned a lesson, Brother Wang, do it

32
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.180
This one is indeed
