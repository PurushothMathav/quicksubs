00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.390
What are you doing? Quanxue, how dare you treat me?

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.990
I belong to the shop opening master of Tianwang Palace,

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.060
Just hit a few and the city will be cheaper for you.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.920
Grandma, you saw it,

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.100
Sheshe, second uncle, you are being supported by everyone!

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.710
He actually dared to attack me! I'm going to learn from him!

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.940
Brother, the whole school will hold on together! You are impulsive!

8
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.820
It’s not all because of you that I had to choose this bone-backing knife husband!

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.080
Ah, how dare you choose to take action on me!

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.540
Brother, I love this life for a lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.440
For life!

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.700
I've long been unhappy with you

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.120
You thought you slapped me

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.580
Is that all?

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.450
Take action against me

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.310
If you break it once, the result will be determined later. You clearly declare that I will not care about you.

17
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.440
You just lied. Anyway, you are good at it.

18
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.319
It’s time for grandma to sing and dance

19
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.460
Although there are mistakes in civilian recruitment, it is certain

20
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.850
This is killing you

21
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.240
If you have bad grades, kill him sexually

22
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.570
In harmony with it

23
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.500
If you want to be recruited by the public, you should still be a boy.

24
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.850
Still missing from us

25
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.030
Just give me someone, give me someone, give me someone, give me someone, give me someone, give me someone

26
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.470
Give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person Give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person Give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person, give me a person Give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person, give me one person
