00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.430
Now you are eating here while watching carefully.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.450
I'm watching again, you really mean what I'm saying,

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.070
The real features of the eyes and body cannot be found in other stores.

4
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.650
It’s true, grandma’s eyes are the same as mine.

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.110
Sure enough, why don't you give me the sword and gun quickly?

6
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.880
I see,

7
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.600
Everyone has already seen that eating,

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.260
But love is the grandson’s face,

9
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.020
I don’t want to be born when I sleep, it’s true,

10
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.300
Don't talk nonsense.

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.280
Sorry, grandma, it’s time we went out to eat together again.

12
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.280
You didn’t do it, so how much money did you get?

13
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.360
I don't, I don't want to see her again, let her

14
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.160
I'm going to get out of here

15
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.520
Sit down outside

16
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.000
So what if it turns out the person is fake?

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.340
Also played some famous songs

18
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.000
I am her grandson

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.920
In front of so many ice sculptures

20
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.900
She can do it for this waste

21
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.560
She, her own grandson, looks like an old lady

22
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.140
There are too many homes here

23
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.220
There are always too many kinds of people, my mother

24
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.200
Remember you

25
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.820
I'm not prepared for you

26
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.820
So here

27
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.180
Even if you are a clueless old lady,

28
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.680
know you are happy

29
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.180
This is what I deliberately started from homeland

30
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.360
It’s the Ministry of Education that helped you beg.

31
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.010
Drive straight, eight hundred and eight hundred and eight hundred

32
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.190
Your hands are attentive

33
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.070
Did you hear that? Eight hundred

34
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.390
That's your fault

35
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.910
I don't get it every time. Where do I see it?

36
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.190
Me, you and Mr. Ye

37
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.750
It’s just a bunch of people born with it.

38
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.390
The world doesn't know

39
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.870
What does Fang Chu Yeye think?

40
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.690
So that you have to marry this feeble thing

41
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.610
I don’t play anymore

42
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.910
It’s like the face was infected alone

43
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.230
Let them both get divorced

44
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.050
I just don’t know if Ye Shaoxian is free

45
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.950
In our family, Wan Ning is here to marry a noble man.

46
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.220
Only late would rather

47
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.560
This time it’s all night

48
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.060
Look at the management, even Yanshang doesn’t dislike you.

49
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.020
Why don't you hurry up and get this expensive divorce?

50
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.330
How late should I be

51
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.730
It’s your turn to be patient in hiding.

52
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.160
As for gifts

53
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.640
I don't need you to take care of me

54
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.840
You mean you're looking for someone else too

55
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.740
I just don’t know how angry you would be if you were lying or not

56
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.690
The gift I prepared

57
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.130
Of course it's not like this.

58
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.270
Garbage on the countertop

59
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630
The eight million gift is rubbish

60
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.070
your whole body

61
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.430
I got it for 800 yuan.

62
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.910
I looked at his whole body

63
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.030
Only one sin left

64
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.830
Please go and stop acting like crazy

65
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.110
You can give up, you are strong enough
