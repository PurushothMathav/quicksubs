00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.820
What are you doing for us? Although you must order it.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.010
Eat eat eat eat eat eat eat eat eat

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.690
Unexpectedly, Chen Xunzhuang's waste material came at a glance.

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.210
They are here too. What are they here for?

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.070
Do they have a dental wall contract?

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.680
They booked Ye Katon’s Liar and Bao Xiao

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.760
Liar and Baoxiao

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.190
They can actually hear it

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.500
I think it should be to use Rongye

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.940
I lost it and paid for it.

11
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.400
Otherwise, lie to his identity

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.720
What can be done to determine Ye Katon’s liar and Baoxiao?

13
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.840
Rongye’s last favor

14
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.700
It’s not the benefits gained from Rongrong

15
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.510
So come and try the subject

16
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.700
It seems that the useless friend Lian Guang

17
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.900
Is it just the word "into the present"?

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.140
I just said it's okay to be more considerate.

19
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.340
He also shared the lyrics first

20
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.760
Go out and pass by Kali

21
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.550
And asked us both to apologize

22
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.870
Still Still Still Still

23
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.390
Still, still, still, still, still, still

24
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.630
Still Still Still Still

25
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.770
Still Still Still Still Still Still Still Still

26
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.050
Still Still Still Still

27
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:11.150
Still Still

28
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.630
Still Still Still Still Still Still Still Still Still

29
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.970
Still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still, still.
