00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.540
The company has been established, is there anything you need my help with?

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.480
You will always say, don't stress yourself first.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.900
Nice, I can listen to the project I implemented.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.880
Now Jiyuanhui is selling them, how many can you use?

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.750
I will lead people to arrange some projects, and I will arrange them minute by minute for the market.

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.150
I have asked the project to be picked up before and after, after reporting the time,

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.140
You can make an appointment for your own program directly with the identity program.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.340
With so much to complain about, I believe the company will send a few people to fight in the past.

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.540
If the design group has access, you must be able to get projects.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.040
You dare to do this to us, we are your original valley,

11
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.960
I have been sloppy for you for so many years.

12
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.780
He was once your savior

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.000
That is, I will actually report you

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.560
He can't hear us taking it off

15
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.960
You said itâ€™s not because Fang Qin is taking you seriously, right?

16
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.780
Yes, public salt

17
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.880
I have been following you for ten years

18
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.280
He asked you to use the apology I took off

19
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.080
This Grand Duke Salt is looking at his master again

20
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.940
He is outside

21
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.380
He doesn't take you seriously

22
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.280
What you said

23
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.500
This is Mr. Chen, he is here

24
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.160
Yesterday, something bitter happened

25
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.849
He asked someone to start the fight today.

26
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:05.930
Look at me

27
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.440
Mr. Chen even beat you up.

28
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.970
I know that

29
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.310
What did you say?

30
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.270
Did you see it?

31
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.610
Deal with it

32
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.810
Another princess purpose

33
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.140
We gave them a kick in the ass to laugh
