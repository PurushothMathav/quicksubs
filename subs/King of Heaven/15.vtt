00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.420
Yantuo, you can behave well later.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.160
Don't worry, whatever you say this time, you can drink this.

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.240
Grandma, my brother has revised his plan with the help of Ye Shang in the past few days and said,

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.220
What about your contract for dining?

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.960
This time we have continued to make significant changes to the actual group,

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.740
In fact, the group will definitely choose to contract with us.

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.890
Why are you here, mom?

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.630
Chen Xue has a way

9
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.650
How many tricks do we need to train?

10
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.690
Let's cooperate first

11
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.490
But you have to be strict in training

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.530
Successful Yan Jiazi

13
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.310
manager position

14
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.870
There is still a way to make Xun Zhi Kaizi

15
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.990
Signed a contract with our Lujia team

16
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.710
Are you going abroad for a trip?

17
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.730
Being independent in your career saves trouble

18
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.570
How can you believe this trash?

19
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.310
And if there is really a counter-test

20
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.870
How is it possible to go there with three and one in a hundred places? Yes, it saves trouble.

21
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.060
Don't be fooled by a spy

22
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.800
Is it not available somewhere in the area?

23
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.940
You can't play in the Mu family because the facilities are so high.

24
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.270
Still zooming in

25
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.690
Do you want to say that you are a white stall?

26
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.350
Is there any other hidden identity?

27
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.850
Be able to support trouble-making groups

28
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.510
Even Jiang Bulongan

29
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.269
If you select them all, don’t brag.

30
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.310
Our Buddha head has something to do with you

31
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.450
If it weren't for the sake of our family,

32
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.030
And the specifications of today’s Fact Group tender meeting

33
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.710
It's a kind of this that doesn't go in

34
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.470
I'm not as good as myself

35
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.800
Even if you don’t have the vision of the Gu family

36
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.340
I can also stand up and turn around, hurt the black, good, good, good

37
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.040
God wants to see

38
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.800
There is no such thing as our home

39
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.900
How are you going to get in later?
