00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.290
Why? Actually, after all, I don’t have much money.

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.960
Because of some work and even no attendance,

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.360
But he is taking care of my life. Someone will follow me and prepare to add one by one,

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.180
When you're hungry, there's nothing better than cooking when you're hungry.

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.280
So after three years of roast chicken and balsamic vinegar, I already had a relationship with him.

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.640
Although it is difficult, I ignore it, ignore it,

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.560
Ignore it, you won’t even listen to me asking for you,

8
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.040
Ignore it, you won’t feel that you have been promoted overnight by the company in recent years.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.020
It's just bad, no,

10
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.400
Not even that, then why don't you get to know this waste?

11
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.780
I think it's because this trash is in my heart

12
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.320
Your position is more important than grandma

13
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.400
So you do it for him

14
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.840
You don’t even listen to what Yuan Guannao says, right grandma?

15
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.200
It’s not that I can’t accept your words

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.960
I can help you with anything

17
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.620
I will also consider getting married.

18
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.310
It's me, you can't be grandma

19
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.410
I think if he is

20
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.590
The real intention is to see your order

21
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.770
It’s the others we added together

22
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.550
After the manager’s special appointment

23
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.590
You can do it later than me. What do you think? Grandma, I’m fine, I’m watching you.

24
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.070
It’s really a scene of eating

25
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.790
Not great anymore

26
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.170
Even I shed tears

27
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.130
That being the case

28
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.590
This is the physics of the general manager

29
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.000
You don’t have to fuck grandma anymore

30
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.020
Can I walk in?

31
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.540
It’s you who will update Elf three years ago

32
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.180
Tomb family Bingming’s broken wish

33
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.690
What do you guys have saved?

34
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.930
In his later years, Ren stopped his teeth

35
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.950
Only to break the old shackles into shackles

36
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.270
Now you are anxious to think that

37
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.030
He doesn't want the future

38
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330
He has always experienced the purpose of leaving the job and handing over the car.

39
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.790
Aren't you afraid of the tomb family?

40
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.690
Will Bingming go bankrupt again?

41
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.130
Stop acting here and listen

42
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.890
We admit that we are capable

43
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.190
But the impression has now been reaffirmed

44
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.190
It's not like we're going to go back to the situation we were in three years ago.

45
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.230
capable at night

46
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.510
Do I have the ability?

47
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.320
you have the ability

48
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.240
I think you are only a criminal

49
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880
These are my Jedi

50
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880
I can't do it without you

51
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.880
How about you being such a late citizen?

52
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.160
Just promise him Wan Min

53
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.600
Otherwise

54
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.640
Have you rescued and let grandma out now?

55
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160
You people want it

56
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.900
If you dare not speak to him,

57
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.300
You and he are released together to the late people.

58
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.460
Since they are heartless and heartless

59
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.520
Just don't agree

60
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.330
Got the attitude

61
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.000
I believe it doesn't cost much

62
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.639
You will thank you later
