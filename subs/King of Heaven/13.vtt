1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.920
Mr. Long specially ordered me to come. What kind of guest?

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.650
Is there any mistake?

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.450
Are these reasonable?

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.790
Don't bring a TV and there will be less left.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.320
Free of charge

6
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.660
Toll farewell let's go

7
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.600
Although too much choice

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.990
It's reasonable to give this away, so I still want to go.

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.150
Is it because of your expense?

10
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.860
You must be a quiet person

11
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.560
Then what choice do you really have?

12
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.580
He must have some kind of responsibilities

13
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.960
Also, team housekeeping is the most important thing

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.700
Or the investment fair in three days?

15
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.570
The most important thing now

16
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.710
It’s the investment fair in three days.

17
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.960
It shouldn't be

18
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.060
If I still owe leave this time,

19
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.320
This general manager has a position

20
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.400
You don't have to be big anymore

21
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.640
you thought there was love

22
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.480
If you don’t play, you think it’s the one with the best network, try another one.

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.570
Let the people in the design department come up with the final program at home

24
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.890
I want to score three points and then even another hundred points

25
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.160
After that 10 billion contract for the objects, you can let it go

26
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.420
Among the eighteen pieces delivered to Mu’s house

27
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.180
You give them all

28
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.420
After the three-pointer, after the wave

29
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.400
after the object

30
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.040
after the object

31
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.540
after the object

32
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.400
Wave after object

33
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.000
after the object

34
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.600
one more thing

35
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.330
We have found out the normal shot of the object by someone as well.

36
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.500
I will let the king of heaven know for you to come forward

37
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.140
I specially asked for your assistant. Please give me your special words.

38
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.880
Then geography is for the old lady

39
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.140
Have you contacted him?

40
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.020
Thereby forcing your flatterer to leave the meeting with his wife
