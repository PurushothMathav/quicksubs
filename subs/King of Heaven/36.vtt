00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
Tongye, please let me accompany you to tell the story of eleven and twenty-one

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.160
I can even agree to it at my own expense.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.900
But when you sell, the whole family comes together to find it,

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.720
It's hard for me to say.

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.600
Colleagues, if you lose to death, you will win.

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.850
Just wait until you get up to tell all about the family!

7
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.860
I, too, tell you.

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.660
Let’s deal with it first, then it’s time to deal with it formally.

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.340
It's official, you've offended the family enough,

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.540
What else is formal. Of course let Wannian,

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.890
From the formal way of looking back to the family manager.

12
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.660
Confirmation case, what do you mean? Senior brother

13
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.620
You haven't got it yet

14
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.310
What about the designed contract?

15
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.140
That's the Circle Department, right? My Circle Department

16
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.280
Just find a recruitment agency and re-bid.

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.290
Why are you playing with Miss Ning? Playing with Ning’s mother?

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.500
Let me play with Ning

19
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.760
Once you get the design and calculation contract, you and I will know

20
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.300
Found TSMC

21
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.260
Wan Ning Ruo is returning to the tomb home

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.200
Why was he dismissed from the team?

23
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.040
That design group happens to be the same

24
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.920
But if you don't want to play

25
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.880
How do you meet your team position when you return to Tomb Home?

26
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.920
Then the design group's settings are so good

27
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.780
It's just a bad spleen that can't make your feet fat, you bastard

28
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.300
What will your current general manager of the company do?

29
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.870
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

30
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.290
tube will protect

31
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.610
It’s grandma in front of you, not you.

32
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.690
The general manager of Mujia will come out, right? Grandma
