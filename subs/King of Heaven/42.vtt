00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.680
Anyway, you can still eat

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.760
Did you know clearly from your mother’s side that this is a joint picture of the group?

3
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.140
How could it be possible to take it down like this?

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.270
Don’t know the general manager’s position

5
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.350
Do you even want to look at my mother's house?

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.430
Are you five years older than the top 30 players?

7
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.980
How expensive is it for you to grow like this?

8
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.620
The three major marriage services have become a hundred people and they are willing to pay. Why don’t you?

9
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.230
Now even the members of our family will mature with you

10
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.730
Three big marriage service revenge

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.080
To me, the three major marriages are in danger of getting the throne.

12
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.830
More dangerous, more dangerous to remove people

13
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.330
What do you do to buy a daily newspaper?

14
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.530
Everything you have is your first priority, your nourishment.

15
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.630
Later it comes from agriculture

16
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.890
Help and Qin Debt

17
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.230
There was an explosion last night if I didn’t contact you

18
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.790
How can you still think about letting agriculture be on the side?

19
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.050
No agriculture to help you

20
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.290
How can you stop fighting?

21
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.610
How to blast you

22
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.190
is lost

23
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.800
You should learn to accept the nuclear power of the four major bookmakers.

24
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.320
Everything else is fine

25
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.380
I have these questions

26
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.910
Ning Wan didn’t know what she was capable of, okay, these things

27
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.630
If you don't bring me back

28
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.850
Try the group's qualifications

29
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.850
i thank you

30
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.690
Without tens of millions, who would lose the general?

31
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.730
I also know my current strength

32
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.600
It is impossible to grasp bigger events

33
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.240
But let me remind you

34
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.160
As long as it's perfect

35
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.620
More protection for perfect security

36
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.050
But toward the night market

37
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.010
It’s a sport for everyone’s sports fans

38
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.720
I leave it to you together
