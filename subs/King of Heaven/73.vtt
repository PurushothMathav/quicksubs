00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
Grandma, what should we do now?

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.990
Without these partners, our current solution would be a dead end.

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.070
The attendant who selected the top in the outer city originally said,

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.830
We are definitely facing a process now.

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.970
It turns out that these are all good habits.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.100
Telephone calls and phone calls are just useless habits, so why don’t we just give them up?

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.180
Grandma, let’s just say this.

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.140
Grandma, if we go and talk to people like this,

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.780
I read a sentence.

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.710
Okay, what's your solution?

11
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.860
Didn’t you say that at most night

12
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.660
Then I, her, and the others will come begging me.

13
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.680
Why haven't you come yet?

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.460
Can you tell me whether it's accurate or not?

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.190
There's nothing I can do with you

16
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.540
Yes, we should not

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.280
Let’s go back and beg your grandma

18
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.690
As long as you submit to everyone

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.650
I believe your grandma knows everyone.

20
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.530
And as long as we are one now

21
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.850
As long as she has a contract worth 10 billion

22
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.330
Is it the heart of a family or you?

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.630
You'll see soon

24
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.300
It's not you
