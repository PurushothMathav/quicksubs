00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.740
The word is wrong,

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.520
The program is just a companion.

3
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.820
Make a mistake, Mr. Program is my friend,

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.640
How could I get it wrong,

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.880
Lord Long, you are really a program.

6
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.080
Mr. Program,

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.920
Mr. Program is my life,

8
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.360
It’s my rescue day. Just settle down

9
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.620
Maybe it’s

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.260
Easy professional things

11
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.620
It's all about hearing

12
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.370
For God's sake

13
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.710
Our eyes

14
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.510
willing to have sex

15
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.310
Being a bit sad

16
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.230
He really is your savior

17
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.530
This is still false

18
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.870
In this case

19
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.770
If I, Ye Xia, are willing, it’s fine.

20
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.550
It's all about hearing

21
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.490
Our family

22
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.090
I'm also willing to take out a piece of clothing to match it.

23
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.410
My Sun family is also willing

24
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.210
Horse is willing

25
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.450
To match this level of scene

26
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.790
A family like ours is also willing

27
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.020
What is the true meaning of the promise?

28
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.740
Please agree quickly

29
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.680
More than one billion is relatively large and belongs to you.

30
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.800
As long as you promise to be satisfied first, that's fine. I don't want your money.

31
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.600
It’s all at your own expense, right?
