00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.066
Justice will not be blinded

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.700
Would you rather not know that your death is coming?

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.566
It's you and the temple behind you that will die

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.233
Even the princess will

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.800
Will also die at the hands of the king

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.000
The consequences of your deception to the king

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.400
Will fall on your own heads

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.600
One piece to hell

9
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:25.866
Haha, I'm afraid it's you who will go to hell.

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.266
Princess, you are here

11
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.666
I don't know what you are doing.

12
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.166
What am I doing?

13
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.466
Don't you understand?

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.033
today

15
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.033
I'll let you

16
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:47.100
Dispose of it with all the remnants of the temple

17
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.033
Then let's try it out.

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900
Look at your magic height

19
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.966
It's still me
