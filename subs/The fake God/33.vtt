00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.066
Mr. Feixiang, you are here.

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.333
What's going on here?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.566
Lord Feixiang, this kid impersonates the Lord God

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.966
And can't pull out the sword

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.333
Don't be deceived by him

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.666
Do you think

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.666
I can't even tell if the teacher is real or fake

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.900
Sir Feixiang, how dare I question you?

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.366
Right? What do you mean?

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.900
Sir Feixiang, listen to me

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.100
This kid is good at acting

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.066
And there are also 9 adults next to them giving instructions

13
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.433
That's a professional actor

14
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.633
Everyone around him was deceived by him

15
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.600
Oh my lord flying

16
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.866
You haven't seen the Lord God for so long

17
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.366
You were deceived by them, and that's normal.

18
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.700
General Xu Shaode has already said it himself

19
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.766
God is not false

20
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.766
You still say that?

21
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.600
Are you questioning the Flying General?

22
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.200
He's a counterfeit

23
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.533
Boy, didn't you say you are Lord God?

24
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.366
Didn't you say you could pull the Excalibur?

25
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.166
Come on, do it!

26
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.166
Xu Shaode

27
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.766
Interrupting the ceremony is punishable

28
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.600
Flying Lord

29
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.366
As long as you can hand over this counterfeit

30
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.000
I'd rather be punished by this

31
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.966
What a pity!

32
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.633
Some people just don't dare to draw this sword

33
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.700
Weren't you pretty awesome before?

34
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.100
Draw your sword!

35
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.066
What's the hurry?

36
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.266
It's not too late to pull out when you've got everyone together

37
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.100
I'm afraid you can't pay the price

38
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.233
Hahaha

39
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.933
There is nothing in this world that I am afraid of

40
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.966
If you have the ability, pull this sword out

41
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.666
I can afford it

42
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.500
Oh, everybody.

43
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.666
Do you all want to see Lord God draw his sword?

44
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.800
Oh Lord God

45
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.333
Didn't you say you were real?

46
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.066
Then prove it to Young Master Xu

47
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.500
That's right if you dare not draw your sword

48
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.900
That is a false god

49
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:28.666
brother

50
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.600
You bring out a fake Lord God

51
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.400
What do you mean?

52
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.000
Fool us

53
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.300
Just fooling fools

54
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.133
Just fool us, boy

55
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.000
Do you hear me?

56
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.200
Everyone is waiting for you to draw your sword.

57
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.800
Shut up, this is the scene of the lockdown

58
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.166
Wait so loud

59
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.633
Do you want to go to Zhao Prison?
