00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.900
Xu Shaode, your arm is actually healed

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.066
Now again.

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.333
What do you want?

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.966
Huh?

5
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:07.900
Is this your house?

6
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.366
Why can't I come to your ninth brother?

7
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:13.266
I really didn't expect you to be so brave

8
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.700
He actually brought a counterfeit to participate in Shoufeng

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.500
Humph

10
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.166
Are you really not afraid that your lies will be exposed?

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:19.966
Really?

12
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.700
He actually said that the Lord God is a counterfeit

13
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.966
The Lord God clearly has Jinghong Sword

14
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.233
Yes, could it be that Young Master Xu is going to be fenced again?

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.200
As long as more people recognize you as God

16
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.600
SF Express can succeed

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.266
God is God

18
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.333
Have you forgotten your lesson the other day?

19
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.766
Flying General and your father

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.300
I have already knelt down to worship the Lord God

21
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.366
So what if I was?

22
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.866
Fake is fake

23
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.966
The real Lord God is already dead

24
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.500
You are so deceiving yourself

25
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.633
Not ashamed at all

26
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.366
Brother Jiu, you said

27
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.466
When you are in bed

28
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.333
Are you so shameless?

29
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.266
Brother Xu, I killed you

30
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.366
No idea.

31
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.766
This young master is a blessing in disguise

32
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.833
utilitarian increase

33
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.000
Why do you still want to count me?

34
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.866
Xu Shaode

35
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.133
You are no longer worthy of piece counting.

36
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.200
And I should come out of this world
