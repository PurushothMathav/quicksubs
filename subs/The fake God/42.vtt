00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
Hold on.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.633
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

3
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.500
Loyalty and filial piety, I am at odds with you

4
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.100
Xu Ding's photo of your clothes

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.166
That's the one.

6
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:18.300
Democracy that has been a shrinking turtle in the back?

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.100
presumptuous

8
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.100
How can the Mingzhu be an existence that you can humiliate at will?

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.466
Xu Ding, you are a mere god general

10
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.666
Dare to yell at the Lord God

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.966
courting death Xu Ding

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.466
Leave quickly

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.333
I can tell the king that Baoer is waiting for a way out

14
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.566
Otherwise, your Zhenguo General Mansion will behead all the doors

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.800
Hahahahaha

16
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.666
Wang Wei thinks you are just relying on your two words

17
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.633
Can you intimidate me?

18
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.900
Lord Mingzhu will never let you go

19
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.466
You're all going to die.

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.833
Mingzhu Xu Ding

21
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.400
Do you really think Master Ming can really stand up for you?

22
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000
British get out

23
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.500
How do you know Lord Mingchu's name?
