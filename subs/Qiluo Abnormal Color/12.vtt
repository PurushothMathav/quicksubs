00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.466
What’s going on, Xiao Jian?

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.566
You are...?

3
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.333
Let me introduce her to everyone

4
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.333
This is my daughter

5
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.566
Ye Qi Luo

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.100
She just returned from London last week

7
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.366
Director Wen has taken great care of Ms. Ye

8
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.266
Today is the first time we get to admire her beauty

9
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.766
She truly has the same elegance as Director Wen

10
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.233
You're flattering us

11
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.533
Xiang Jie Group

12
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.233
is now part of the broadcasting station too

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.300
So from now on

14
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.766
let’s not be so formal with each other

15
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.300
Qi Luo just arrived

16
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.500
Let me offer a toast to everyone

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.966
Why is that gentleman staring at me?

18
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.933
He’s the host of our TV station

19
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:51.633
Xiao Jian

20
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:52.866
Xiao Jian

21
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:54.733
Xiao Jian

22
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.733
Hey, Mr. Star Host

23
00:00:58.766 --> 00:00:59.833
Why do you look so lost?

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.966
Look at this wedding photo

25
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.500
Ms. Ye and Xiao Jian’s wife

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.833
look exactly alike

27
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.333
He must be missing his wife

28
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.100
Fate is truly mysterious

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.866
Mr. Duan,

30
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.166
where is your wife?

31
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.166
I’m really sorry

32
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.866
Please excuse me for a moment

33
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:26.566
Everyone—

34
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.666
Please, please

35
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.066
That’s impossible

36
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:29.833
In this world

37
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.166
How could there be two people who look exactly alike?

38
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.766
She can't be Ye Ci

39
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:37.666
But right now, Ye Ci

40
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.666
is still in prison

41
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.666
That’s right

42
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.866
Do you remember last time

43
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.766
she was able to make a phone call?

44
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.933
Call her now
