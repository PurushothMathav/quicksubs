00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:02.933
Defendant Ye Ci

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.433
Do you admit

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.733
on the evening of September 17th

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.033
you drove the car with license plate

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.933
Jiang A0996, black

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.333
and hit the victim Jiang Lai

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.566
causing an accident and fleeing

8
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:45.933
Honey

9
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.766
Honey, wake up, please wake up!

10
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.433
Honey, wake up, please wake up!

11
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.166
What's wrong?

12
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.166
You

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
When I was driving

14
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.466
The girl, the girl

15
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.500
she rushed out again

16
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.566
Honey

17
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.700
Listen to me

18
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.033
This kind of thing

19
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.366
Must be confessed voluntarily

20
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.233
Only confession can reduce the punishment

21
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.033
No

22
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.600
You checked

23
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.700
There was no surveillance camera at the scene

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.333
There was no surveillance camera. Right.

25
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.466
Duan Xiao Jian

26
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.733
The truth will out

27
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:29.866
This can't be hidden!!

28
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.633
Then what can I do?

29
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.133
You're a famous host

30
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.300
Once I'm in there

31
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.100
I'm done for

32
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.666
Honey

33
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.500
Is this okay?

34
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.500
Take the blame for me

35
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:57.333
You'll find the best lawyer in Jiang City

36
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.466
try to reduce the punishment, okay?

37
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:05.900
You want me to

38
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.500
to take the blame for you?

39
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.066
Honey

40
00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:16.466
I'll confess

41
00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:18.366
At worst, spend a few more years in jail

42
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.433
You're different

43
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.466
You're a public figure

44
00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:25.033
If you go in there

45
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.100
you'll be finished immediately

46
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:29.733
Honey, 

47
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.166
I beg you, please?

48
00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:32.933
Just this once, okay?

49
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.766
Honey

50
00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:42.500
You swear 

51
00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:43.933
This life of mine

52
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:45.433
whenever

53
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.933
You’ll never betray 

54
00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.033
our marriage

55
00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:51.066
and never abandon our child

56
00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:52.966
Okay?

57
00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:08.633
You will take care of the boy

58
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.433
raise him well 

59
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.533
You will frequently 

60
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.733
bring him to visit me

61
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.166
Defendant Ye Ci

62
00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:32.533
Do you plead guilty?

63
00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:34.500
Murderer

64
00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:35.866
Give me back my daughter’s life

65
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.433
Honey

66
00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:41.233
Turn yourself in

67
00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.500
Try to get a lighter sentence

68
00:03:59.166 --> 00:04:00.266
I confess
