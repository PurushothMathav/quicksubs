00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:10.333
Why did you suddenly ask me to go for a night run?

2
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.466
You and your wife

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.666
met during a night run

4
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.066
Mr. Duan,

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.866
are you trying to reenact *Ruan Ruan Is Like Her*?
(*Ruan Ruan is very much like her — a reference fans of *Empresses in the Palace* would understand*)

6
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:21.533
Look over there

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.333
That’s

8
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.266
where I met my wife

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.033
There were a bunch of thugs back then

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.533
I walked by

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.666
and drove them all off

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.266
So what?

13
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.333
Even such a romantic start

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.066
ended in divorce

15
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.133
What if

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.433
I said it was for you?

17
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.466
Mr. Duan,

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.566
that’s not funny

19
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.533
Everyone in Jiang City knows

20
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.633
you divorced

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.833
to marry Su Man

22
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.566
Actually, I had my reasons

23
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.100
It wasn’t voluntary

24
00:00:58.766 --> 00:00:59.533
It was...

25
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:00.633
because

26
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:01.700
Right now I

27
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:02.666
don’t even have the energy

28
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.533
to think about this

29
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:05.566
My mom is preparing

30
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.433
to groom me as...

31
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.100
the heir to the corporation

32
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.666
I’m trying really hard to perform well now

33
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.666
Don’t you have a younger brother?

34
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.033
Your mom wants to hand the company to you?

35
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.100
Ye Qi has had

36
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.466
fragile health since childhood

37
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.466
My mom and I

38
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.333
just want him to grow up healthy

39
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:24.566
Have some warm water

40
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.033
Peanut powder
