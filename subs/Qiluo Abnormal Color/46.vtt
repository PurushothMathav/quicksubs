00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.700
Your cousin is getting married soon

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.333
He asked me to order a pair of rings

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.166
No need to check

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.900
Just wrap them up

5
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.033
By the way,

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.666
what you said on the night run

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.666
still counts, right?

8
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.433
You said you divorced Diep Tu

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.100
because of me

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.700
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

11
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:30.966
It's nothing

12
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.433
My mom's birthday is in a few days

13
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.433
She wants to ask you

14
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.733
if you can attend the birthday party

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.866
Invite me?

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.133
I’ve been talking to her about you lately

17
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.933
She’s really interested in you

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.566
She’s asking if you’re free

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.766
to attend the party

20
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.100
Oh

21
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.833
Right

22
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:47.966
At that time

23
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.233
All the elites and tycoons from Jiang City

24
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.366
will be attending

25
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.066
Sure

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.166
I’m free

27
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.233
But I haven’t even told you the date yet

28
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.900
Look at you

29
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.766
When is Director Wen’s birthday?

30
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.233
The 20th

31
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.266
The 20th?!

32
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.700
I had someone check the date

33
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.066
The 20th of this month is an auspicious day

34
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.033
Our wedding

35
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.133
let's set it for the 20th

36
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.433
What’s wrong?

37
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.666
Sorry

38
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.166
Could you

39
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.266
please let Director Wen know

40
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.666
On the 20th

41
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.900
I might have some other plans
