1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.433
If she doesn’t want to see me

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.100
Then I’ll come back tomorrow

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.200
Mr. Duan already promised the media

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.200
that within three days

5
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.700
he would publicly release the divorce agreement

6
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.133
Today is the final day

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.100
You people set me up?

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.333
I’m just reminding you

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.566
You can only choose one:

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.966
your future or your money

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.533
He signed it

12
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.666
You can reclaim all the assets

13
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.666
Nine years of love

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.266
Who’d have thought the only thing that could control him

15
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.933
was a house and 8 million yuan

16
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.500
Such a shallow man

17
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.900
No need for regrets, Ms. Ye

18
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.566
You can require him

19
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.933
to move out of that house within a week

20
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.100
No need,

21
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.433
let them stay there

22
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.933
What are you planning?

23
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.666
To walk away with dignity

24
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.133
That’s too easy on him

25
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.233
A cuckoo occupying the nest

26
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.633
Of course he won’t get away clean

27
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.433
Homewrecker, cheater

28
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.633
She’s the mistress

29
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:24.833
What are you staring at?

30
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:25.633
Even if

31
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.033
Duan Xiao Jian is divorced

32
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.866
Some people

33
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.566
still shamelessly act as the other woman

34
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.600
Being cheap is in your bones

35
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.433
What did you say? Say it again!

36
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.733
Get lost!

37
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:37.366
You used to be so arrogant—fine

38
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.033
Now you’re sulking for whom?

39
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.666
We’re colleagues

40
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.666
Wishing you a quick promotion

41
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.066
Let’s go

42
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.300
Shen Yu
