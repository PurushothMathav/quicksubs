00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.333
I was wondering why so many things
have been happening lately

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.100
Turns out you were the one
pulling all the strings

3
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.166
Why?

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.733
Then let me ask you a question

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.133
I’ll tell you why

6
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.266
Where is Le Le?

7
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.500
I'm asking you

8
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.366
Where is my son?

9
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:27.933
Say it

10
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.900
Why won't you say it?

11
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.766
I’ll tell you why

12
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.100
June 3rd

13
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.366
I had a fever for half a month straight

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.733
Dad seemed really busy

15
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.700
I feel so unwell

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.100
Am I going to die?

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.233
Duan Xiao Jian

18
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.133
My son, he’s dead

19
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.700
After half a month straight

20
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.433
Why didn’t you take him to the hospital?

21
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.233
No

22
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.566
I didn’t not take him to the hospital

23
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.333
I just...

24
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.533
I just thought...

25
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.133
I thought it was just a fever—he wouldn't die

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.366
Or maybe you were afraid he’d disturb

27
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.766
your night with Su Man

28
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.433
That boy was your son

29
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.700
He was your flesh and blood,

30
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.533
your biological child

31
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.533
How could you treat him like that?

32
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.833
You bastard

33
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.733
How could you treat him like that?

34
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.266
Enough

35
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.033
The boy didn’t die of a fever

36
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.933
What did you say?

37
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.300
Listen

38
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.333
Give me the card

39
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:52.433
I’ll tell you how your son

40
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.533
really died
