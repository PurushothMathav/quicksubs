00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:18.933
Ye Ci

2
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.766
Mom, Xiao Qi

3
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.500
Right now

4
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.700
I’m on my way to the airport

5
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.733
Forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye

6
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.333
In New Zealand, there’s a

7
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.733
Global Volunteer Association

8
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.333
that specifically helps

9
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.633
homeless children with bronchial cancer

10
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.500
to overcome their illness

11
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.300
I’ve requested to join them

12
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.100
Maybe there

13
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.300
I can truly reconcile with the past

14
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.566
But you two

15
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.833
will always be my family

16
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.566
I hope that one day

17
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.666
we’ll meet again

18
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:16.933
Where’s Xiao Ci?

19
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.333
Mom

20
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:32.966
Tell me—how can a person

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.566
lose someone more than once?

22
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.566
But...

23
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.533
How could I have lost

24
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.833
Ye Qi Luo twice?

25
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.533
Ye Qi Luo won’t come back

26
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:48.933
But Xiao Ci—

27
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:51.766
I believe

28
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.733
She will come back

29
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.166
Mom
