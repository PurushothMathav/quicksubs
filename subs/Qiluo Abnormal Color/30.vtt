00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:01.900
What did you say?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.833
I’m Ye Qi Luo’s boyfriend from college

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.500
She died a few years ago

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.466
Ms. Ye

5
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.333
How do you respond to the accusation

6
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.566
from your ex-boyfriend?

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.766
I...

8
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.700
We apologize to our viewers

9
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.700
There was an incident during the opening

10
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.366
This individual claimed to be

11
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.933
Ye Qi Luo’s ex-boyfriend

12
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.100
Mr. Lin Hao

13
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.366
He was just released from a psychiatric hospital last week

14
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.133
Psychiatric hospital?

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.533
How is that possible?

16
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.533
Paranoid disorder

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.866
So all this time

18
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.100
you’ve been lying to me

19
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:22.733
You’re the ones who are sick!

20
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.333
All of you are crazy!

21
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.366
You’ve all been played by me!

22
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.333
Security!

23
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.333
(Spanish)

24
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.466
Spanish

25
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.700
Nice to meet you all

26
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.233
I hope you’ll take good care of me

27
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:47.533
You can speak it?

28
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:50.466
Then what were you pretending just now for?

29
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.366
You went off script on your own

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.900
Why should I go along with you?

31
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.100
That’s enough

32
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.733
Next

33
00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.700
let’s all enjoy a short video

34
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.933
about Ms. Ye’s life during her university years
