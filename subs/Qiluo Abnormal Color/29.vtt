You sit here first

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.300
I’ll call you

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.100
when it’s time to come out

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:07.866
Okay

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.066
Ye Qi Luo

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.233
Pandora’s box

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.866
is about to be opened

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.866
Today's show

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.100
must be done well

10
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.800
3, 2, 1

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.933

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.533
Wishing all our viewers a pleasant evening

13
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.233
Welcome to tonight’s

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.766
live interview in Jiang City

15
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.366
Welcome today’s guest

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.966
Ms. Ye Qi Luo

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.266
Hey buddy, pause for a second

18
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.400
Ye Qi Luo is live

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.700
I heard that Ms. Ye Qi Luo

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.266
majored in Spanish in university

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.866
Could you greet everyone in Spanish?

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.133
That wasn’t in the script

23
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.033
Stick to the script

24
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.500
Don’t ad-lib the lines

25
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.733
I heard Ms. Ye

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.333
Let's ask Ms. Ye to greet us in Spanish

27
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.566
Ye Qi

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.666
Come to the station right now

29
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.100
What’s wrong?

30
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.233
Doesn’t she know?

31
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.600
It’s been so long

32
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.233
I...

33
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.400
It’s okay

34
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.833
Tonight’s live broadcast

35
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.900
we’ve invited a special guest

36
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.866
to join us

37
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.233
Once she sees him,

38
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.933
Ms. Ye will definitely remember

39
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.433
Let’s all welcome

40
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.900
Ms. Ye’s university classmate

41
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.033
Lin Hao

42
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.666
Where did this classmate come from?

43
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.866
Don’t mess around

44
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.266
Don’t let her fool you

45
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.933
This person is not Ye Qi Luo at all

46
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.566
Ye Qi Luo died a long time ago
