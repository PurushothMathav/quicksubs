00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.033
Hey, Xiao Song

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:01.866
Speak freely, Director Ôn

3
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.733
Your entertainment company

4
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.566
has had a lot of projects recently, right?

5
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.900
We all know each other well

6
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.833
Don't forget to promote Thiếu Gian

7
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.066
No problem

8
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.300
Xiao Jian spoke up

9
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.933
I wouldn’t dare refuse a righteous request(*)
(*) something one cannot refuse for moral reasons

10
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:13.866
Next month

11
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.833
There’s a commercial with

12
00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.733
the international brand Huang Shu Lin

13
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.766
Want to give it a shot?

14
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.700
Really?

15
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.166
Really

16
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.933
Thank you, Director Xiao Song

17
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.100
No worries, no worries

18
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.166
Thanks, Director Wen

19
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.966
No need to be polite

20
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.166
Here’s the thing

21
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.066
You gentlemen go ahead and drink

22
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.133
I have something to take care of

23
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.066
Let’s catch up later

24
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.766
Excuse me

25
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.266
The cake hasn't even been cut

26
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.166
Where are you going?

27
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.633
Right, Xiao Jian

28
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.933
Eat the cake before you go

29
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:43.700
But...

30
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.233
There are a lot of people here

31
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.366
If you leave now,

32
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.033
you’ll make my mother lose face in public

33
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.666
How can I do that?

34
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.066
Director Wen,

35
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.666
let’s cut the cake

36
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.433
It’s so late already

37
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.766
Where’s the groom?

38
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.866
It’s bad enough he didn’t welcome guests

39
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.266
Now he’s late for the ceremony

40
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.100
Totally impolite

41
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.966
How much longer do we have to wait?

42
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.533
Our time

43
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.033
is still time, isn't it?

44
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.066
Happy birthday

45
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:47.900
Happy birthday, Mom

46
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.866
Director Wen

47
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.466
Let me toast to you

48
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.633
Wishing you a happy birthday

49
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.133
May you stay forever young

50
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:58.500
And youthful forever

51
00:01:59.133 --> 00:01:59.900
Thank you

52
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.966
Please, Director Wen

53
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.733
Director Wen

54
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.266
Happy birthday

55
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.700
Thank you

56
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.533
Trying to leave again?

57
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:15.933
I need to use the restroom

58
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:17.833
Thiếu Gian,

59
00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:19.566
do you remember

60
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.133
what you told me yesterday?

61
00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:25.433
You divorced Ye Ci

62
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:27.733
because of me, right?

63
00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:30.633
Yes

64
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.233
Then let’s get married
