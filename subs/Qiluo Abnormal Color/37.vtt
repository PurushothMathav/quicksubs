00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.100
Ye Ci was released from prison a month ago

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:02.933
What did you say?

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.700
Ye Ci has already been released?

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.933
Excuse me,

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.100
are you Mr. Duan?

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.766
Hello,

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:16.066
I’m Ye Ci’s legal representative

8
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:17.700
Legal representative?

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.966
What’s going on?

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.666
Why did the officer say she was released?

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.700
Ye Ci is still in custody

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.700
There must’ve been another inmate

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.333
with the same name

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.066
Same name?

15
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.500
Even the same charge?

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.066
Hello,

17
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.566
can you show me

18
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.966
Ye Ci’s sentencing record?

19
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.166
Sorry

20
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.700
you don’t have the right to see it

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.133
Luckily it was just a name match

22
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.666
You just said

23
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.666
you’re her lawyer?

24
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.266
Why does she need a lawyer?

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.700
She saw the news yesterday

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.566
and guessed you'd come to sign the divorce

27
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.466
She already knows?

28
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.766
Good

29
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.900
That saves me from having to explain

30
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.100
Call her here

31
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:06.500
Let her sign

32
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.300
She doesn’t want to see you

33
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.733
That’s why she gave me

34
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.266
full negotiation rights

35
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:12.700
Negotiate?

36
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.766
Negotiate what?

37
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.966
She agrees to divorce

38
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.433
But...

39
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.566
you have to sign her version of the agreement

40
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.066
The house

41
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:33.866
The child

42
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.166
And all shared assets

43
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.733
belong to her

44
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.100
What about me?

45
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.100
She paid for the house herself

46
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.166
The shared assets,

47
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.166
including 8 million yuan,

48
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.266
were deposited by her

49
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.700
During that time, you withdrew 2 million

50
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.533
I withdrew money

51
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:52.466
to pay for our son’s schooling

52
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500
I won’t argue with you

53
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:54.300
I want to see her

54
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.266
I already said

55
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.166
She won’t see you

56
00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:58.733
This is between husband and wife

57
00:01:58.766 --> 00:01:59.900
None of your business
