00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.233
No

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.466
Don’t get worked up

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.866
The memory card isn’t with me

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.166
I gave it to Ye Ci

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.300
as soon as I arrived

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.300
If anything happens

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.466
to me or Director Wen

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.666
he’ll take the evidence to the police

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.866
Ye Ci

10
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:25.566
I’m asking you,

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.933
where is the memory card?

12
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.033
Stop right there

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.833
Didn’t you want this card?

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.333
Here, I’ll give it to you

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.433
Throw that card into the fire pit

16
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.666
You blind or something?

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.866
Throw it in

18
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.133
Mom

19
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.833
Ye Ci, from now on

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.533
we’ll be like

21
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.133
water from different wells

22
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.766
Goodbye

23
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.366
You think

24
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.533
this is all over now?

25
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.766
One more minute

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.766
What do you mean, one minute?

27
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.666
Before I arrived

28
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.500
the contents of that card

29
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.933
were uploaded to the Jiangcheng forum

30
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.366
Scheduled for 4:00 PM sharp

31
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.866
Now the evidence is irrefutable

32
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:27.833
If you’ve got anything to say

33
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.866
say it to the police

34
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.166
Ye Ci

35
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.033
I didn’t expect this

36
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.166
You really are something

37
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:38.966
Didn’t you want to know

38
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.233
how Le Le died?

39
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:41.533
Let me tell you

40
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.966
He didn’t die because of me

41
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.366
Le Le died from bronchial cancer

42
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.366
Bronchial cancer

43
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.833
had been advanced for a while

44
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.166
Why bring him only now?

45
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.566
The treatment cost alone

46
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.366
was at least 2 to 3 million yuan

47
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.066
Better start saving up

48
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:02.100
Duan Xiao Jian

49
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.166
What exactly did you do to my son?

50
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.666
Le Le

51
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.966
You must have suffered so much

52
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.733
Daddy will set you free

53
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.766
Okay?

54
00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:31.466
As your biological father

55
00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:34.366
he personally removed your oxygen mask

56
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.733
Even though there was money in the joint account

57
00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:38.566
why didn’t you treat my son?
