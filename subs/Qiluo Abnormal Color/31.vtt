00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.033
Damn

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.166
It’s Su Man and Duan Xiao Jian

3
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.300
So the hosts

4
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.366
were sneaking around like that?

5
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.133
This man, just two days ago

6
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.700
was still promoting the image of a ‘loving husband’

7
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.033
And now he’s cheating

8
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.533
That fall from grace came fast
(\*refers to celebrities getting exposed for scandals)

9
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.266
One cheats while married

10
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.366
The other’s a homewrecker

11
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.233
I think both of them

12
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.633
are trash

13
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.166
You can even play like this?

14
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.700
It’s over

15
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.366
It’s over, totally over

16
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.366
Food delivery’s late

17
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.366
Didn’t you want excitement?

18
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.033
Now the whole Jiang City

19
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.100
is watching you cheat

20
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.266
Isn’t that even more exciting?

21
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.366
Tech

22
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.433
Cut it

23
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.833
Turn it off now

24
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.233
Shut it off

25
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.566
What are you doing?

26
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.700
Stop the video now

27
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.966
Where is everyone?

28
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:46.866
Who’s in there?

29
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.666
Open the door

30
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.500
Who’s inside?

31
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.933
Open up, open the door!

32
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.900
Why are you standing there?

33
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.266
Turn off the video now

34
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.033
Director

35
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:55.966
Should we cut the livestream first?

36
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.933
Cut it

37
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.366
I’m asking you

38
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:04.733
What’s going on?

39
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.866
I don’t know either

40
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.100
You don’t know?

41
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.133
You were missing during the recording

42
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.633
And now a major issue during the live broadcast

43
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.266
If you don’t want to work here, then while it’s still early

44
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.433
get the hell out!

45
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.166
It was her

46
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.300
This was definitely Ye Qi Luo’s doing
