00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.133
Currently, you are the only one

2
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.300
whose test results are compatible

3
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:13.933
Donating bone marrow

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.266
could give you a reduced sentence,

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.133
an early release

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.900
The decision is in your hands

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:18.900
Think it over carefully

8
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.966
I’ve thought it through

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.333
I want to be released early to see my husband and son

10
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.833
My husband has never brought my son to visit

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.033
I don’t even know

12
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.566
how big Le Le is now

13
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.766
I forgot

14
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.766
my husband doesn’t know I’ve been released

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.633
I’ll surprise him when I get home

16
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.733
Can’t believe seven years have passed

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.233
Everything in the house is just the same

18
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.433
Why is there lipstick?

19
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.766
That Shen Yu woman

20
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.700
Is she mentally ill or something?

21
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.100
Every year on her daughter’s death anniversary

22
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.366
she comes to the TV station’s gate for a memorial

23
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.766
So unlucky, it’s annoying

24
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.633
Shen Yu’s daughter

25
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.666
Didn’t she die right in front of the TV station?

26
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.100
Even the security guards don’t dare stop her

27
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:53.666
Then kick her out

28
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.366
Seeing her every day is such a nuisance
