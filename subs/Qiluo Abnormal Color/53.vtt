00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.366
You're right.

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:01.533
You're just foolish.

37
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:03.733
In this world,

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.366
the person who wants that pair of scumbags dead the most

39
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:07.900

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:20.566
Why?

46
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.533
I said, now

47
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:22.700
why are there so many issues?

48
00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:24.033
So it was all orchestrated by you?

49
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.866
Why?
