00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:01.500
Of course

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.433
But

3
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.333
we still need to trouble Ms. Su

4
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.366
to make another trip herself

5
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.166
I’m sure it’s not that simple, right?

6
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.233
That’s right,

7
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.533
I just want to confirm one thing

8
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.100
You’re the heiress of Xiang Jie Group

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.833
The precious pearl in Wen Zhucheng’s hand

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.100
Surely you wouldn’t stoop

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.833
to stealing someone else’s husband?

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.666
Where did

13
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.300
this low-class tramp come from?

14
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:26.833
You

15
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:28.566
Wen

16
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:30.266
Director Wen

17
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.966
Can’t even control

18
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500
a man who wants to climb up

19
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.266
and comes threatening

20
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.100
my daughter Wen Zhucheng’s girl

21
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.733
I didn’t

22
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.866
I just came to deliver a wedding invite

23
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.166
Do you even know where this is?

24
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.666
The Wen family’s floor is cleaner than your mouth

25
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.700
You even have the nerve

26
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.633
to deliver invitations for *your* wedding here

27
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.300
How embarrassing

28
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.866
Sorry for the disturbance

29
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.100
That shameless pair

30
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.233
when are they getting married?

31
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.066
The 20th

32
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.433
Looks like we need to speed up our plan

33
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:18.666
Got it,

34
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.233
I’ll come home after picking up the wedding rings

35
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.166
Qi Luo

36
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:28.633
Why are you here?

37
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.533
Oh

38
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.166
You came just in time

39
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.033
I was picking out a gift for my mom

40
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:35.766
Let me take a look at this one

41
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.166
How about this necklace?

42
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:44.500
It’s beautiful

43
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.233
Wrap this one up with the others, please

44
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:49.633
Oh right

45
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.233
Why are you here?

46
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.566
Ah, I was just passing by

47
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.033
Saw you here and came in

48
00:01:59.133 --> 00:01:59.866
Mr. Duan

49
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.533
You’ve arrived

50
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.266
Here are the wedding rings you ordered

51
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.633
Would you like to check them?

52
00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:09.500
Wedding rings?
