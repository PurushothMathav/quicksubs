00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.266
Didn’t you say

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.966
if I agreed to resign

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.966
you would marry me?

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.033
What?

5
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.966
Having second thoughts now?

6
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.300
Right now

7
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.900
I don’t have the headspace to think about this

8
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.733
My mom is planning to groom me

9
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.233
as the heir to the company

10
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.100
I’m trying hard to perform well

11
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.700
Your mom wants to hand over the company to you?

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Marrying Su Man

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.133
only helps you keep this job

14
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.933
But being with Ye Qi Luo

15
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.033
means practically owning

16
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.100
the whole Xiang Jie Group

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.566
How is that possible?

18
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.766
I just think the 20th

19
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.766
is a bit

20
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.133
sudden

21
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.033
Ye Ci’s been in prison for 7 years already

22
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.366
Still not enough prep time for you?

23
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.300
What do you mean by that?

24
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.833
Need me to remind you?

25
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.566
The accident 7 years ago

26
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.466
I’m the only witness

27
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.433
The only one who can get the case...

28
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.500
reopened

29
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:53.833
You’re threatening me?

30
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.766
Don’t think I don’t know

31
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.866
what you’re thinking

32
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.933
Eating from your bowl

33
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.166
while eyeing the pot

34
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.633
That’s how you end up in jail

35
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:06.966
Fine

36
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.566
Why wouldn’t I marry you?

37
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.666
I just thought...

38
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:11.733
Planning a wedding

39
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.233
takes a lot of time

40
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.900
I was worried it’d tire you out

41
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.233
You’d better...

42
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.100
Fine, the 20th it is

43
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.566
Let’s just go with what I say, okay?

44
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.033
What are you doing here?

45
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.300
Of course, to hand out wedding invites

46
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.266
On the 20th of this month

47
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.033
Xiao Jian and I

48
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.833
will hold our wedding at Century Hotel

49
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.266
Will you come?
