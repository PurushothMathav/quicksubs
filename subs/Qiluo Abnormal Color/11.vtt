00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.200
Wen Zhu Qing?

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.100
So that means

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.233
her daughter must be Ye Qi Luo...

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.033
I heard she's coming too

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.700
That's great news

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.166
Ye Qi Luo, huh

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.633
She’s never appeared in public

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.066
Yet she’s always ranked No.1

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.566
on Jiang City’s trending topics list

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.133
If we can get her on the show

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.866
our rating(*) will skyrocket
(*) viewership rate

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.133
If this episode succeeds

13
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:30.900
You’ll firmly secure

14
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.566
your position as the station’s top male host(*)
(*) Chinese showbiz term, referring to a man in a leading position

15
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.366
How about

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.733
we host the celebration

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.133
at home?

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.366
Why?

19
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.333
As the host

20
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.433
turn the party into a family banquet

21
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.900
Isn’t it even more likely

22
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:48.900
that Ye Qi Luo would attend?

23
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.500
You’re as smart as ever

24
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.033
I’ll propose it to the director right away

25
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.366
Director

26
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.333
I have something I’d like to suggest

27
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.166
The “Good Husband” is trending again

28
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.766
All our coworkers are talking

29
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.366
Be mindful of what you say

30
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:23.666
Still denying it

31
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:27.866
Everyone’s already here

32
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.766
Please come in

33
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:33.733
Tu Man

34
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.900
Tu Man is free today

35
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.233
I specially asked her

36
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.300
to come early and assist

37
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:39.700
I see

38
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.366
Why hasn’t President Wen arrived yet?

39
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.766
Almost here

40
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.833
I’ll go outside and check

41
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:52.166
She’s here, she’s here

42
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.166
The mysterious major shareholder of our TV station has arrived

43
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.700
Director Wen, Ms. Ye

44
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.733
Welcome

45
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:02.633
Sorry we didn’t meet you outside

46
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:03.666
Please

47
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:04.733
This way
