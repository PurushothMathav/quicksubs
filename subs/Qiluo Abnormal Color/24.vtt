00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.166
Ye Qi Luo,

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.566
what are you trying to do?

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.433
I...

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.833
Are you trying to k.i.l.l me?

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.666
Already can't handle this?

6
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.933
I was even wilder abroad

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.366
What do you mean?

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.766
You don’t understand the game of mother and child?

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.066
When people face d.e.a.t.h

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.966
They experience ultimate p.l.e.a.s.u.r.e

11
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.933
The closer to d.e.a.t.h, the more blissful it feels

12
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.166
Who would have thought the dignified heiress

13
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.366
of the Xiang Jie Group’s chairman

14
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.366
would have such a fetish

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.333
Clean up quickly after bathing

16
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.966
We’ll play slowly later

17
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.533
What are you doing?

18
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.966
I can't wait for later

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.766
Ye Qi Luo,

20
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.866
I’m a man

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.166
Aren’t you filming the show anymore?

22
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.566
Hey

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.333
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable

24
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.166
It’s almost time to shoot

25
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.000
Where’s Duan Xiao Jian?

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.366
Might be stuck in traffic

27
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:12.933
I’ll give him a push

28
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.166
Hurry up

29
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:18.533
What now?

30
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.733
Still can’t reach Ms. Ye

31
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.866
What exactly is going on?

32
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.433
Didn’t you say

33
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.733
you already invited someone?

34
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.033
I...

35
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.433
Why are you just standing there?

36
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.833
Go find someone, quick!

37
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:34.966
Xiao Jian,

38
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:35.933
calm down a bit

39
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:36.966
We’ll do it again tonight

40
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.300
There’s really something going on

41
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:44.666
Xiao Jian

42
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.533
Ms. Ye,

43
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.266
are you trying to have fun with me?

44
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.166
There’s still one hour left

45
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:52.666
Let’s go all out quickly
