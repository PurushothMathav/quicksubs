00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:12.933
Ye Ci

2
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.033
Honey,

3
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.700
You have a phone now?

4
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.266
Today is my birthday

5
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.166
so they gave me a phone

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.500
Where’s Le Le?

7
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.966
Let me talk to our son

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.866
Nian Nian

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.333
Nian Nian... he

10
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.633
I want Le Le to record a video for me

11
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.500
To wish me a happy birthday

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.666
Is that okay?

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.966
Alright,

14
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.266
I’ll send the video after it’s done

15
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.433
What now?

16
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:52.766
What are you afraid of?

17
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.366
It’s just a video, right?

18
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.300
Ye Ci

19
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.700
she wants a video of her son

20
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.066
Where are you going to find someone to film that for her?

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.700
Back then when Ye Ci

22
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.833
was sent to prison

23
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.733
Her son was only 8 months old

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.166
And in the past seven years

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.433
you never took Le Le to visit her

26
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.866
Do you think

27
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.233
she even remembers

28
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.500
what her son looks like?

29
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.566
You mean...

30
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.866
Isn’t there a kid already available?

31
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.433
Smart thinking, as always

32
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.466
Hey kid

33
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.166
What’s this?

34
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:34.900
A plane

35
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.433
It’s a gift for you

36
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.533
Can you help me with something—

37
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.433
Mom, I’m Le Le

38
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.966
Happy birthday, Mom

39
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.533
I love you the most

40
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.300
Duan Xiao Jian

41
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.833
Where are you hiding my son?

42
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.933
Ye Ci, what are you doing here?
