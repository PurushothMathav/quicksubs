00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.300
This matter...

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.266
Although the station's reporters handled it,

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.266
the director said

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.900
the impact was too great

5
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.033
The two of us can’t

6
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.366
host the same show anymore

7
00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:10.300
So you’re sacrificing me

8
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.633
for your own benefit

9
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.466
Man Man

10
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.966
Didn’t I already tell you?

11
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.700
I want to divorce Ye Ci

12
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.500
We’ll be together openly

13
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:19.500
By then,

14
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.833
what’s mine will all be yours

15
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.966
So you really want to marry me?

16
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.100
Just play along for now

17
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.966
I can’t afford to lose this job

18
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:31.433
Of course,

19
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.433
you’ve done so much for me

20
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.033
I’ll definitely take responsibility

21
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.666
Then go sign the divorce with Ye Ci tomorrow

22
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.100
Okay

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.566
Director Wen

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.166
No need to have

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.366
Ye Qi follow me anymore

26
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.300
I can protect myself

27
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.100
Did he cause you trouble?

28
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.433
Anyway, he got hurt today

29
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.500
because of me

30
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.700
I’m worried

31
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.466
Let him stay with you

32
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.700
Since his sister passed away,

33
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.700
he’s never cared about anyone like this

34
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.633
Ye Ci

35
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.666
Come over here a moment

36
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.300
Look at this kid, such a temper

37
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.466
I’m heading out

38
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.100
What do you want?

39
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.933
I can’t button this with one hand

40
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.566
There are so many people at home,

41
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.266
why must you call me?

42
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.133
There are plenty of people at home

43
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.333
I got injured because of your sister

44
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.100
All buttoned up

45
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:01.866
I’m going now
