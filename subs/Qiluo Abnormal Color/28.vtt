00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.433
Duan Xiao Jian

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.400
Su Man

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.033
Why are you here?

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.433
There’s someone in prison

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.033
Someone hidden at home

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.733
And now you're sneaking around with someone else outside

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.400
You’re never satisfied, are you?

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.433
Was it really necessary to sleep with a guest

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.666
on the day of the shoot?

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.033
The show\...

11
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.700
Even turned off your phone

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.500
Afraid I’d interrupt you two, huh?

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:28.933
It’s not that

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.333
Su Man, listen to me

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.900
I...

16
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.433
I just wanted to take a bath

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.266
I don’t know why I fell asleep here

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.533
I swear

19
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.933
I don’t know anything

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.566
I swear to you

21
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:44.066
I’ve seen that woman’s face a hundred times already

22
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.066
I’m sick of it

23
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:45.933
Why would I

24
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.066
look at her a second time?

25
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.033
Really?

26
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:49.900
Really

27
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.266
I swear

28
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.366
Everything I’ve done

29
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.433
was for work

30
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.500
Then why won’t you marry me?

31
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.500
Who said I wouldn’t?

32
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.733
Cherish the happiness you have now

33
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:22.466
Husband

34
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.833
Hello, Director

35
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:27.900
This is Qi Luo speaking

36
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.933
I can participate in the next episode

37
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:30.900
But...

38
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.300
I don’t want it to be pre-recorded

39
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:33.500
I want it to be live

40
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.333
She’s here, Ms. Ye has arrived

41
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:51.966
Ms. Ye has always been very private

42
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.966
Why did you decide to join

43
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.033
this interview show this time?

44
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.133
This is your first public appearance

45
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:55.633
Is there anything

46
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:56.966
you’d like to say to the viewers?

47
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.266
Everyone, please

48
00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.466
tune in to the live broadcast on time

49
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.166
That’s Ye Qi Luo

50
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.366
Who are you?

51
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:07.833
What are you sneaking around the door for?
