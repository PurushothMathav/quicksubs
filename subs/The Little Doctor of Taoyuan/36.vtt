00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.000
I have dealt with the Mei sister fish.

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.766
Good idea.

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.400
But let's offend another village this time

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.766
I'm afraid these days are not going to be easy

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.600
Zhang Feng, do you want to pack up and go first?

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.900
What's the matter, Sister Mei?

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.000
You are afraid

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.700
What am I afraid of?

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.966
I am a widow who has overcome a broken palm

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.633
If they really want to kill me

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.000
Then kill it

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.600
One hundred and one

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.666
Sister, I don't know how to comfort you

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.866
Don't belittle yourself

15
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.666
You care too much about what other people think.

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.733
In fact, the so-called severed palm

17
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.966
It has nothing to do with customer service.

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.400
That's all folk talk

19
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.700
Look at this palm print

20
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.366
One is the wisdom line.

21
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.500
One is the emotional line.

22
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.100
These two lines merge into one

23
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.066
It's called a severed palm.

24
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.300
In fact, a severed palm means that you are very subjective

25
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.966
Reluctance to listen to other people's opinions

26
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.366
Second, your adaptability and adaptability are also very strong

27
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.166
Love and hate

28
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.600
Don't give up until you succeed

29
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.000
These characteristics are generally good and bad

30
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.800
But it has nothing to do with customer service.

31
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.933
Trust me, you will have a great career in the future.

32
00:00:58.933 --> 00:00:59.866
Someone will love you too

33
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.433
Really? Really? Do you believe me?

34
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.366
Of course I believe you.

35
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.700
So I'm not cheating on my man anymore
