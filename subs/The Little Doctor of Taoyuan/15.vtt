00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Yes, Mo Yan

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.966
Maybe I actually saw it in a book

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.700
Oh, Dr. Chow!

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.133
How can we do this?

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.333
I still have to farm to make money

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.966
I'm still looking for a wife.

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.100
I can't see that.

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.266
We need an ambulance

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.800
Go to a big hospital to see it?

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:20.966
Go to a big hospital

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.433
Ouch, I don't have that kind of money.

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.500
Ouch, hemiplegia, hemiplegia

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.700
Oh, you bunch!

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.733
Quack doctor, what about your wife?

15
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.800
Oops, it's getting late.

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.800
Dr. Zhou, I have a set of ancestral acupuncture

17
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.866
Why don't you let me try?

18
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.900
Really lad

19
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.366
How do you know if you don't try?

20
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.533
Maybe you can

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.666
And it's free.

22
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.666
Hey, is that what you said?

23
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.000
If anything happens, it's none of my business.

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.733
Is there a problem?

25
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.566
I hummed alone

26
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.200
I have a recording.

27
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.900
It still matters

28
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.600
Master Mo, you are lucky today, my apprentice?

29
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.566
Just will cure your disease

30
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.733
Are you going to suffer from other diseases?

31
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.266
He may not be able to cure it yet

32
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.666
Oops boy, hurry up and stick me with a needle

33
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.400
After the tie is done?

34
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.900
I still have to go to work

35
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.500
This stroke is hemiplegic.

36
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.033
If left untreated

37
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.700
It is estimated that Auntie will be like this in the future

38
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.366
It's hard to correct.
