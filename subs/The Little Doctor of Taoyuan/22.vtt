00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.266
This pond belongs to everyone

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.133
No, it's home.

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.533
This pond was dug by my father before he died

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.766
Because our land is prone to drought.

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.566
So the process was to dig this pond before he died

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.733
When it rains, you can get out of the water.

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.333
So when there is a drought

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.166
We can water the ground

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.633
OK, then you write it down

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.233
I want sugar cane.

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.733
Lotus root porcelain mushroom

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.300
rice

13
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.566
Peanuts and cabbage, these seeds or seedlings

14
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.566
Oh yes, and fry

15
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.066
I can do this with my crash course.

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.700
Okay, just in time. I'm going to the market tomorrow.

17
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.966
Another day, I'll show you my mountain.

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.366
Ah, it's finally done!

19
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.366
I'm going home.

20
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.766
Our little doctor Zhang

21
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.066
It's still very hard

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.033
How did it go?

23
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.500
Do you want Sister Wei to go home and make up for it for you?

24
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.466
Help! You're a doctor

25
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.133
Miss, please save us.

26
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:58.933
Save the rich woman

27
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.366
If we don't save him, he might die

28
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.200
Go, go, go

29
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.900
Let's save people first
