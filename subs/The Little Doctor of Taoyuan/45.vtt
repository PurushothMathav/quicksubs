00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.133
Ah!

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:05.800
People like this are going to have to be pulled out of both men and women.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.900
The highlight is the oil pick-up driver.

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.200
Do you think so?

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.033
What else do you two have to say?

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.533
Zhou Dahai, is your IQ low?

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.700
Still no IQ at all

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.800
Do you believe what Li Dazhu said?

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.166
I see you as a pig.

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.366
Still a stupid pig

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.066
Village Chief, my cousin is right

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.466
You are really a stupid pig.

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.466
What did you say? Think for yourself.

14
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.600
You'd rather believe him as a villain

15
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.466
You don't want to believe me, a weak woman

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.800
My life

17
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.266
We all know

18
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.966
Which man dares to have me?

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.433
Besides, I got my widow's license three years ago

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.266
If I wanted to steal a man, I would wait until now

21
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.466
You are so confused

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.366
Or did you secretly take some advantage?

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.666
Li Dazhu, are you lying to me?

24
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.466
Village Chief, how dare I?

25
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.566
Well, besides, he said it himself

26
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.833
He's Halfhand's life

27
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.600
I have nothing to do

28
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm looking for him

29
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.633
A woman like him

30
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.033
Still a widow

31
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.366
I want face too

32
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.600
I'm a decent person.

33
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.800
You know my line, village chief

34
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.566
I'm an intern at your son's health center

35
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.633
I live up to my conscience

36
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.966
Li Dazhu bullied Liu Bei

37
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.266
Even stronger

38
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.466
It seems that he is the villain to complain first

39
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.866
If you have any conscience, don't be deceived by him

40
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.100
Li Dazhu, stop for me

41
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.966
Zhang Feng Liu Bei, don't let him run away
