00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.866
Hey, what are you three doing?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.266
Three of them said they were thirsty and came in to get a sip of water

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.500
You stay with them for a while

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.233
I'll go get them some water.

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:12.966
I hid it

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.266
I think there's something wrong with them.

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Okay, okay.

8
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.666
Hey brother, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.400
Our room doesn't want to be photographed

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.100
It's a bit rude of you to do this without our consent.

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.466
The first time in the village is easy

12
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.400
Take some pictures and send them to Moments. What's the matter?

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.966
So stingy

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.966
Yo, the three of you have been waiting for a long time.

15
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.733
But I think these three are a bit face-to-face.

16
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:40.133
Where? Two of your friends got lost.

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.200
Come and find it

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.900
If you see it, you must tell us

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.366
Here's our card.

20
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.666
There are 100,000 blocks

21
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.466
Too bad we didn't see the key

22
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.833
If you see it, I will definitely ask you to receive the reward.

23
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.266
It seems to be fine.

24
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.366
There we go.

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.200
Thank you for the water. Bye. Bye.

26
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.800
There are others

27
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.400
It sounds like a girl
