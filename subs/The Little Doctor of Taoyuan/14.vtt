00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.466
Dr. Zhou's illness is a bit like a stroke and hemiplegia

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.966
Why don't you take a look again?

3
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.233
Who are you?

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.800
Brother Zhou, this Zhang Feng is your intern

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.900
I brought him to report today

6
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.300
Ah, you are Zhang Feng?

7
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.900
Hello Doctor Zhou

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.866
A lot of advice

9
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.100
How do you know what's wrong with him?

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
You can't cure me by yourself

11
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
And use an intern to fool me

12
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.400
Let me tell you something.

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.166
You won't cure me today

14
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.066
I let the whole village know

15
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.400
You bunch of quacks!

16
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.366
Auntie, do you have three highs?

17
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.766
Yeah. Hey.

18
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.066
What does this have to do with a crooked neck?

19
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.766
So when did you start like this?

20
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.266
Jumped in the fecal water half an hour ago

21
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.100
Ouch, it's all flashed

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.366
The neck is not as simple as flashing

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.400
If you don't treat it right away

24
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.200
Maybe it will be crooked for the rest of its life.

25
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.466
Boy, don't scare me
