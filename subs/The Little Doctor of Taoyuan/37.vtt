00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.000
Ah, these two acres of land are full of rice.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.000
Unfortunately, it is harvested once every six months

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.766
It's not even 2,000 bucks.

4
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.400
Is this Shennong tree useful?

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.700
Ah, what are you talking about?

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.366
Xiao Zhang

7
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.666
Nothing. I once heard of a method.

8
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.066
The crash course.

9
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.700
It allows the growth cycle of plants

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.600
drastically shorten

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.700
What if it works?

12
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.500
We will harvest much faster than others

13
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.100
Didn't you say that these two acres of land are collected once every six months?

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.700
I can't make 2,000 bucks

15
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.400
Right.

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.466
Because when you harvest, others harvest as well.

17
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.800
The rice in this market is piled up into mountains

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.333
It's strange to be able to sell at a high price

19
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.466
But if you sell it when you're in a hurry

20
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.266
The price must be twice as high.

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.366
Then you have the ability?

22
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.600
I'll try that.

23
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.866
But don't let anyone know about this

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.300
Including your little sister
