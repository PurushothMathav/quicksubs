00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.433
Are you all right?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.733
It's okay. It's okay.

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.300
Maybe it's too urgent to wait.

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.366
It will be fine in a while.

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.033
But you still care about people

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.433
Do you want my sister to reward you tonight?

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.466
You're welcome to this little thing

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.566
Really don't need it?

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.766
My reward.

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.866
It's super super good.

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.500
No, no.

12
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.266
No, no.

13
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.300
Oh, don't be in a hurry to refuse.

14
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.633
Come home for dinner with me first

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.166
Sister, your friend?

16
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.733
Sort of, I just met today

17
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.566
Then I'll go to the field to pick some vegetables later.

18
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.166
I'll cook for you tonight

19
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.666
Just have a good chat with your girlfriend

20
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.233
Okay, go quickly, slow down, okay

21
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.700
That's your little sister?

22
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.966
Yeah, he looks good.

23
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.166
Have a stubborn disease

24
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.866
156th

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.600
Okay, let's not talk about this

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.766
Look at this sweet

27
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.066
It's all ours

28
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.166
What fruits and vegetables do you want to eat?

29
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.433
You can pick it yourself.

30
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.366
Okay, thank you, sister. Okay

31
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.400
Then I don't care about you, I'm going to work too

32
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.466
Feed my old scalper

33
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.200
Then you go first

34
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.800
Well, okay. Bye.
