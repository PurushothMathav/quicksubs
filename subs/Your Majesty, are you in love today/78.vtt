00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.833
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager must be in poor spirits due to her illness recently.

2
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.066
Don’t take her words to heart.

3
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.800
I don’t hold any grudge against the Empress Dowager.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.233
The Empress Dowager is also acting for the sake of the palace's harmony.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
Your Majesty, don’t let the conflict between me and the Empress Dowager affect you.

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.833
I understand, but I still feel that the Empress Dowager

7
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.666
seems to be putting on a show.

8
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.366
Not to mention that we were once allies,

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.400
even if she doesn’t like me taking sole charge,

10
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.666
she shouldn’t be so overt about it.

11
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.600
After all, she was the previous champion of palace intrigues.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.266
It is a bit strange.

13
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.566
But this is human nature.

14
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.966
Your Majesty should still find time to accompany the Empress Dowager more.

15
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.800
I understand.

16
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.866
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.200
Shen Wuqiu requests an audience.

18
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.600
Your Majesty, I visited Divine Turtle Mountain.

19
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.166
Divine Turtle Mountain is the primary source of facial reconstruction techniques.

20
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.300
I found that the local residents are terrified when they talk about it.

21
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.200
Legend has it that this ancient technique

22
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.066
can drive people to madness and death.

23
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.666
Now it is nearly lost to history.

24
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.166
He probably wouldn’t dare to use it recklessly now.

25
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.766
I called you here today

26
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.200
to discuss a more important matter.

27
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.100
Your Majesty, please speak.

28
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.966
This concerns the Empress Dowager and cannot be delayed.

29
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.633
I will certainly do my utmost.

30
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.300
Ah, right.

31
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:57.266
Your Majesty, I have one more thing to report.

32
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:59.166
On my way back,

33
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.266
I saw many impoverished people suffering from the plague.

34
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:04.566
They said that the southern region is severely affected.

35
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:05.900
What did you say?
