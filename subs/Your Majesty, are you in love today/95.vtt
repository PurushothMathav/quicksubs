00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.766
Imperial Brother, what are you doing?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.600
What exactly has the Emperor done wrong?

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.766
What is the Emperor's reasoning?

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.600
Prince Rui has made contributions in the protest, hasn’t he?

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.100
Why treat him this way?

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.166
Fanghua used a human skin mask.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.066
I don’t understand either.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.066
Why does my most favored younger brother act against me?

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.033
Even going so far as to poison me and attempt to kill me?

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.566
What? It was actually Prince Rui?

11
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.066
I had no intention of harming you, Imperial Brother.

12
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.766
Fanghua will only cause your body to weaken.

13
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.200
It won’t endanger your life.

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.366
Besides, I have the antidote here.

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.800
You won’t be in trouble.

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.433
You’re being foolish. Why are you doing this?

17
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.666
Because I want to prove myself to Mother.

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.900
Why?

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.666
Just as I am also Mother’s child,

20
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.566
Mother can sacrifice herself to help you obtain the throne,

21
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.366
suffering and worrying.

22
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.266
And me?

23
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.600
Even commenting in front of Father,

24
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.500
I am punished.

25
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.700
You can go to the battlefield alone,

26
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.900
but I,

27
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.633
every time I want to go to the battlefield,

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.866
Mother, you block me in every way.

29
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.000
Mother, am I really worse than Imperial Brother?

30
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.766
How can you think that?

31
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.700
I am doing my best to protect you.

32
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.833
Your Imperial Brother is risking his life for the throne.

33
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.133
How could I let both of you go to your deaths?

34
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:27.033
Even if you think Mother favors Imperial Brother over me,

35
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.300
I can still be a good emperor.
