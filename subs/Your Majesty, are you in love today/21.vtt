1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.466
Consort Rong has made me kneel at Shengxin Temple.

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.766
Since ancient times,

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:08.033
no one has ever come out of Shengxin Temple.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.900
Sister, you’re so ruthless.

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.466
Aren’t you covering up something?

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.266
Consort Rong, I did it deliberately.

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.533
When I arrived,

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.500
there was only Lin Guiren at the scene.

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.966
Emotionally and logically, he should be a suspect.

10
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.533
Your Majesty, this is unjust.

11
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.866
These are just some people who haven’t returned yet.

12
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.333
That’s why I went to find him.

13
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.066
Who knew, if not for Your Majesty,

14
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.600
you would indiscriminately accuse me.

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.100
Quickly, take her away!

16
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.266
How did I indiscriminately accuse you?

17
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.500
You,

18
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.966
Anyway, your death has nothing to do with me.

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.700
Consort Liu Bei, before the matter is thoroughly investigated,

20
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.600
It is wrong of you to kneel me down.

21
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.900
Lin Guiren has a point.

22
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.800
What kind of place is the Shenxing Temple?

23
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.233
Once you go in, you either die or suffer greatly.

24
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700
Sister, using your power like this,

25
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.166
Aren’t you feeling guilty?

26
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.700
Stop your nonsense.

27
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.900
Lin Guiren, Lin Guiren,

28
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.000
You keep saying Zhou Caixian’s death

29
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.300
Has nothing to do with you.

30
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.266
Why are you so sure?

31
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.533
Or did you see something?

32
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.500
Intentionally hiding the truth?

33
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.666
I didn’t, hmm.

34
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.700
I was just saying casually.

35
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.200
Why are you in such a hurry?

36
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.900
I, I...

37
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.333
Someone!

38
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.366
Take this person away and interrogate her strictly.

39
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.266
No, no, no, let Zhang Jia speak.

40
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.666
They’re saying it now.

41
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.800
Sister Chen was messing around that day,

42
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.866
She found a eunuch soldier.

43
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.466
Why didn’t you say this earlier?

44
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.833
Deliberately framing Consort Rong.
