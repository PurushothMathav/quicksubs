00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.600
Your Majesty, Minister Shen requests an audience.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.033
Let him wait outside. I will see him shortly.

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.366
You should rest well.

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.033
I’ll be right back.

5
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.966
Biyuan, come here.

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200
The Empress blames me for not protecting you well.

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.033
It’s not your fault. What happened after I lost consciousness?

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.233
The Emperor is asking

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.100
Minister Shen to investigate this matter thoroughly.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.300
He also asked what you have been doing recently.

11
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.300
It seems the Emperor suspects me.

12
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.633
I need to be careful.

13
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:40.966
But,

14
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.266
should I tell him about Duke Yuan and the consort’s conspiracy?

15
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.500
Will he believe me?

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.833
You say this matter is related to Duke Yuan?

17
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.633
I found that the lamp had been tampered with.

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.066
A maid mentioned

19
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.900
seeing Duke Yuan near the lamp.

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.233
Good. I haven’t confronted him yet.

21
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.066
He seems anxious now.

22
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.566
Also, with Princess Loulan’s death,

23
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.866
the border soldiers are now on high alert.

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.800
We don’t have clear evidence yet.

25
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800
If we arrest Duke Yuan, he might not confess.

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.166
Don’t worry. I already have evidence.

27
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.800
First, confine him.

28
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.466
Don’t let him die easily.

29
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.466
I

30
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.033
still need to send him a special gift.

31
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.766
I will follow your orders.

32
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Why are you still awake, Your Majesty?

33
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.866
Have you found out who the culprit is?

34
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.400
It’s Duke Yuan. As expected, it was him.

35
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.066
I overheard a conversation

36
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.200
between Duke Yuan and the consort in the Imperial Garden.
