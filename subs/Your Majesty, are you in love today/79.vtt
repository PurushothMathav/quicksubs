00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.366
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager mentioned that he is busy with state affairs.

2
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.500
She has destroyed the Yangxin Palace.

3
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:25.000
I understand, but Wang Momo has arrived.

4
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.666
Wang Momo? Yes.

5
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.866
Please invite him in quickly.

6
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.100
Wang Momo, please come in.

7
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.700
This old servant sends greetings to the Empress.

8
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.366
I apologize for any offense.

9
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.900
I hope the Empress will be understanding.

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.366
Momo, you are too kind.

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.000
What brings you here this time?

12
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.866
This old servant understands.

13
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:50.566
The Empress has recently had a disagreement with the Empress Dowager.

14
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.633
But I have followed the Empress Dowager for over 30 years.

15
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.966
The Empress Dowager is kind-hearted

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.133
and wise.

17
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.233
Momo, just speak frankly.

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.633
Although there are some misunderstandings between the Empress and the Empress Dowager,

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.166
the Empress Dowager is

20
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.566
more deserving of admiration and respect in my heart.

21
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.600
Since the incident with Lady Lin,

22
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.233
I am well aware

23
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:13.033
of your virtuous qualities and abilities, Empress.

24
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.300
You are clear-headed and capable.

25
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.300
This old servant

26
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.400
sincerely asks for your help.

27
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.500
What exactly happened with the Empress Dowager?

28
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:25.800
This old servant would like to request the Empress’s help to investigate in secret.

29
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.666
Lady De?

30
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.566
Lady De?

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.500
Isn't she the Empress Dowager’s niece?

32
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.833
Although Lady De is the Empress Dowager’s niece,

33
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.600
the Empress Dowager only appointed her

34
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.800
because she feared that you might dominate the harem.

35
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.866
It was not with the intention of making her Empress.

36
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.366
Indeed,

37
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.300
in the past, the Empress Dowager never supported the Song family.

38
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.033
She was truly focused on Qin Qi.

39
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.733
Moreover, the Empress Dowager had specifically instructed Lady De

40
00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.266
not to interfere with the harem’s affairs.

41
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:00.866
However,

42
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.900
now Lady De’s actions increasingly go against the Empress Dowager’s original intentions.

43
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.166
What’s strange is

44
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.466
that the Empress Dowager has now suddenly changed her stance

45
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.600
and wants to make Lady De Empress.

46
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.500
The Empress Dowager is always careful and discreet.

47
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.433
She would never be so muddled.

48
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.666
If Lady De is made Empress,

49
00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:20.033
the Empress Dowager and Your Majesty will surely become estranged.

50
00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:22.100
This matter

51
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:24.900
is likely not as simple as it seems.
