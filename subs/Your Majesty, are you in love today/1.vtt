1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.300
The Emperor has passed away.

2
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:22.866
Guards, bring the prisoner before me!

3
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.666
Let go of me! Let go of me!

4
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.166
You vile woman! How dare you poison me?

5
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.566
I will exterminate your entire family!

6
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.266
Su Qingyun, you despicable woman!

7
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.366
What are you going to do?

8
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.900
Imperial Consort Yan attempted to assassinate the Emperor; her crime is unforgivable.

9
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.933
I didn’t! How dare you slander me?

10
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.700
I am the Emperor’s most favored consort!

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.866
So what if you are a favored consort?

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.666
Have you forgotten the things you’ve done?

13
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.000
I am still the Empress!

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.300
But I’m puzzled...

15
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.100
The Emperor favored you so much...

16
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.166
...that he even abolished the burial customs for you.

17
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.900
So why did you poison him?

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.300
Hahaha...

19
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.433
Love me?

20
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.633
He loves me?

21
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.666
If he truly loved me...

22
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.866
...he wouldn’t have let you become the Empress.

23
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.966
I became Empress by the decree of the Empress Dowager.

24
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.566
It was the will of the people.

25
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.566
Killing the Emperor...

26
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.900
...is already a lenient punishment for you.

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.533
Do it, Su Qiuyu!

28
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.000
You dare? The Prince of De will be here soon!

29
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.333
You will die a horrible death!

30
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.466
You will die a horrible death!

31
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.433
You’re dead!

32
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:32.666
Haha...

33
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.333
My lord...

34
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.100
Even as a ghost...

35
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.966
...I won’t spare you.

36
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.866
Then go tell that to the Emperor.

37
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.300
I’ve heard everything.

38
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.566
Well done, Empress.

39
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:49.066
Did she really kill the Emperor because of her jealousy over the Empress?

40
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.433
Such a cruel heart.

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.666
Forget it. Our priority now is to arrange the state funeral...

42
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:55.800
...and support a prince who can be controlled to ascend the throne.

43
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.900
As for this royal scandal...

44
00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.966
...we’ll investigate it later.

45
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.266
The dog Emperor and Consort Yan killed each other...

46
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:05.600
...and I’m the one who benefits.

47
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:08.500
I’ve achieved my goal of ruling from behind the curtain.

48
00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.566
Now, I can finally enjoy a peaceful retirement. Hahaha...

49
00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.066
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

50
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:18.666
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

51
00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:20.166
Something terrible has happened!

52
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.600
Prince Dong'an has rebelled!

53
00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:26.633
He’s already leading his troops to the palace gates.

54
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.633
What?

55
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.666
Your Majesty!

56
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:43.966
The Empress, overcome with grief, has followed the Emperor to the afterlife.

57
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.900
The Empress mourned the Emperor deeply.
