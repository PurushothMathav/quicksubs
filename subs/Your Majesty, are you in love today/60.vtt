00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.366
Concubine, His Majesty is blessed by heaven.

2
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.966
He will surely get better.

3
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.166
Concubine, Your Majestyâ€”

4
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.200
Though the poison has been controlled,

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.400
the situation is still dire.

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.666
We must find an antidote as soon as possible.

7
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.200
We will do our utmost to delay the poison's effects.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.566
I understand.

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.833
Thank you for your assistance, Concubine.

10
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.366
This is the Soul Stabilizing Pill.

11
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.000
It can effectively control the toxins in His Majesty's body.

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.366
But this pill cannot be dissolved in water; it must be swallowed.

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.600
You will need to find a way for His Majesty to take it.

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.266
It seems you'll need to devise a method to get it into His Majesty.

15
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:44.800
Master Li,

16
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.600
Please help me lift His Majesty.

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.966
Turn him over.

18
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.666
His Majesty has fallen.

19
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.066
Ah!

20
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.766
May His Majesty be blessed and protected by heaven!

21
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.666
Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Forever live!

22
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.966
Long live the Empress! Long live the Empress! Forever live!
