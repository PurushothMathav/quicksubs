00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.733
It seems I’ve heard a significant secret.

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.600
Tell me what exactly happened.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.266
Why would you give up even public authority?

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.400
In a month,

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.033
it will be the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet.

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.300
The new palace ladies don’t have the skills.

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.766
I asked the Upper Garment Bureau to make some clothes.

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.566
They actually said they didn’t have enough staff.

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.966
They’re so bold.

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.500
These insolent servants should have their heads chopped off.

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.566
Hmph.

12
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.100
Does His Majesty know why there aren’t enough people?

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.400
I have a bad premonition.

14
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.466
The palace ladies told me

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.966
that half of the embroidery from the Upper Garment Bureau

16
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.333
is for the Phoenix Coronation Gown.

17
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.400
The other half is for the Landscape of the Great Nation.

18
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.533
Is that so?

19
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.833
These two tasks?

20
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.433
All are His Majesty’s orders.

21
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.266
Naturally, I have no objections.

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.000
I can only go wherever it’s cool.

23
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.700
Mm, blame me.

24
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.000
Don’t be angry; I’ll resolve this matter immediately.

25
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.700
How did I not notice before

26
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
that the Empress speaks so sarcastically?

27
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.566
Well,

28
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.766
it’s also my fault for not investigating thoroughly beforehand.

29
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.100
But the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet

30
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.966
concerns the face of our Great Liang Kingdom.

31
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.366
Your Majesty,

32
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.833
it would be best to recruit a batch of embroiderers from the common people.

33
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.700
I will follow your orders.

34
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.566
Then replace the head of the Upper Garment Bureau.

35
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.566
Replace them all.

36
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.366
Thank you, Your Majesty.

37
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.500
Then

38
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.400
you’re not angry with me anymore?

39
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.866
It’s my fault for being unreasonable.

40
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.166
I won’t call you the dog emperor again.

41
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.900
I don’t want to hear apologies.

42
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.633
After the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet,

43
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.233
you should consider the matter of serving in bed.

44
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.266
Oh no, His Majesty seems to be clinging to me.

45
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.966
Your Highness, it’s bad.

46
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.866
The head of the Upper Garment Bureau was taken away by the Department of Justice.

47
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.766
And they’ve ordered a broad recruitment of embroiderers from the common people.

48
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:43.966
How did this happen?

49
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.666
I heard that Concubine Rong caused a huge commotion in the Yangxin Hall.

50
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.566
Su Qingyu,

51
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.033
I’m going to kill him.
