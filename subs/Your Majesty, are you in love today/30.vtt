00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:03.366
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.666
Ning San Si, you will anger His Majesty this way.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.200
So what if I anger him?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.266
If I can’t present the Landscape of the Great Nation and the new embroidery,

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:11.766
it’s still death.

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.800
Might as well die quickly now.

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.400
Ah, His Majesty is currently at the rear.

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.466
Ah, hurry, hurry, your aunt.

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.233
Go and explore the Emperor’s recent strange behavior.

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.566
It’s a good opportunity to gauge the Emperor’s attitude.

11
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.600
His Majesty is requesting an audience with Long Fei.

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.833
What did you say?

13
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.500
Long Fei has arrived.

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.333
What?

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:36.100
Quickly let him in, go and see Long Fei.

16
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.200
Long Fei, are you not angry anymore?

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.933
I lack the ability.

18
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.266
I’m not capable of managing the affairs.

19
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.666
I hope His Majesty will retract the palace authority.

20
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.400
Please appoint someone more capable.

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.266
Does it mean what it says?

22
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.366
I am resigning.

23
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.066
Kill me or punish me as you please.

24
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.533
Don’t speak out of anger.

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.933
Since I’ve given you the authority,

26
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.600
there’s no reason to take it back.

27
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.366
What exactly happened?

28
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.933
My instincts were right.

29
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.366
The dog emperor isn’t angry at all.

30
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:08.100
I was already prepared for his reprimands. Oh God.

31
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
Speak.

32
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.466
I was so insolent just now.

33
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.666
Your Majesty.

34
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.800
Aren’t you angry?

35
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.666
I know Concubine Rong has heard some rumors before.

36
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.600
She misunderstood me.

37
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.366
But I will never be angry with you.

38
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.266
Yesterday’s events were my fault.

39
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.366
Is he apologizing to me?

40
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.266
Oh heaven.

41
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.566
Am I hearing things?

42
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:28.866
Why?

43
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.433
Isn’t His Majesty most fond of Consort Gui?

44
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.833
Yesterday Consort Gui was summoned by the Imperial Censor.

45
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.600
She’s probably very sad now.

46
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.500
He better be at ease.

47
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.933
Rather than plotting with Duke Yuan.

48
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.600
It’s getting worse.

49
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.900
Ah, Your Majesty.

50
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.300
There are some things I cannot explain to you.

51
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.500
But remember,

52
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.666
I only

53
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.566
play along with the consorts.

54
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:53.766
Ah.
