1
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.366
First offense: betraying familial bonds.

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.000
You have ruined familial love.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.100
Your Imperial Brother and Mother have always cared for you.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.900
Yet you, even a crow knows how to show gratitude.

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.600
Are you even worse than a beast?

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.366
Second offense:

7
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.900
Conspiring to harm the Emperor.

8
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.800
The sudden death of an Emperor

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.566
would cause turmoil in the country.

10
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.633
Enemies would invade,

11
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.566
leading to the downfall of the Great Liang.

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.066
You would be a traitor through the ages.

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.866
Third offense:

14
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.100
Against the people.

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.766
You orchestrated the plague in the south,

16
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.966
causing the deaths and destruction of thousands of families.

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.500
Even if you died a thousand or ten thousand times,

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.766
it would not make up for the lives of those thousands.

19
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.033
You used any means to achieve your goal,

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.266
collaborating with Duke Duan to harm your own brother.

21
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.133
Ignoring the lives of the people,

22
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.500
with no compassion.

23
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.100
You are unworthy of being an emperor.

24
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.766
You are unworthy of being a member of the Great Liang royal family.

25
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.633
You donâ€™t even compare to a single finger of your Imperial Brother.

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.900
Iâ€™m sorry.

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.400
I was wrong. I am a sinner of the Great Liang.

28
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.866
I have harmed the country and its people.

29
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.566
How could I be innocent?

30
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.766
I protect the carriage. No, please no!

31
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.766
No, please no!

32
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.500
Imperial Brother, I am ashamed before the people.

33
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.900
I was misled.

34
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.300
I am guilty.

35
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.266
I am guilty towards the Great Liang.

36
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800
Sinner Rui,

37
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.833
requests to be exiled to the border,

38
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.266
until death in battle.

39
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.466
Just to atone for the crimes committed.

40
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.200
Your Majesty,

41
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.800
Grant it.
