00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.500
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.866
What happened to the consort?

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.266
Someone just reported

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:08.200
that after Consort Rong visited the Zhongcui Palace,

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.700
the consort started speaking incoherently. Is Consort Rong alright?

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.766
Biyuan said that Consort Rong has been in high spirits

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.366
since returning from Zhongcui Palace.

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.866
Effective immediately, the consort is to be imprisoned in the Cold Palace

9
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:21.900
as a form of punishment.

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.900
I obey the decree. Wait a moment.

11
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.300
The imperial decree arrives.

12
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.666
By the mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

13
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.100
Consort Rong, Su Shi, is of noble character and virtue.

14
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.600
She is accomplished and virtuous.

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500
She has contributed greatly to the dynasty.

16
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.166
A reward of ten thousand taels of gold

17
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.466
and silver of equal value,

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.300
as well as ten chests of jewels,

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.733
and a thousand pieces of silk and fine food,

20
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:04.700
with the Emperor's approval and this decree.

21
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.000
Consort, receive the decree.

22
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.500
Oh.

23
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.900
This servant receives the decree.

24
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.666
Long live the Emperor! Long live, long live!

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.300
Consort, you are truly fortunate.

26
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.400
Master Li, why such sudden news?

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.600
What is this about?

28
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.733
The Emperor values the consort greatly.

29
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.900
The Emperor has spoken.

30
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.666
Tonight, the Emperor will dine here.

31
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.600
Master Li, Master Li!

32
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.466
Consort, prepare well.

33
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.433
I will take my leave first.

34
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:56.466
Your Majesty, it's not good.

35
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
The consort, in the Cold Palace, has refused to suffer humiliation.

36
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.600
She has hanged herself.
