00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:03.566
Ah, I still have the key to the screen saver.

2
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.333
You'd better have something that will make me spare your life.

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.866
Master...

4
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.766
Your Majesty, Prince Duan is loudly protesting in the forbidden area.

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.866
His cries can be heard ten miles away.

6
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.566
He is also refusing to eat.

7
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.300
He only requests to see you for five thousand.

8
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.900
Since he insists on fasting,

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.833
from today onwards, do not provide him with any food.

10
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:31.366
Let's see just how resolute he really is.

11
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.466
Peaceful.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.400
In the previous life, he even brought his private troops to the palace gates.

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.633
He was quite determined.

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.866
Your Majesty, are you really not going to see Prince Duan?

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.800
After I have dealt with his crimes,

16
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.033
it will not be too late to see him.

17
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.700
Oh, Consort, are you feeling better?

18
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.266
I’m fine now.

19
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.700
I’m much better; the doctor said there’s nothing serious.

20
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.033
Today, I stopped taking the last dose of medicine.

21
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.666
Good, good. Since you’re fine now,

22
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.700
I will stay the night in the Changchun Palace.

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.100
Aren’t you afraid of me catching a cold?

24
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.200
If you’re worried about catching a cold, you should go back to your Yangxin Palace.

25
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.033
Why are you fighting me for the blanket?

26
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.066
I’m cold.

27
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.266
Your Majesty, if you want,

28
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.800
you can ask Bi Yuan to bring you another new blanket.

29
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.300
I wouldn’t dare to pass on my illness to you.

30
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.233
No need to trouble yourself. If I hold you, you won’t feel cold.
