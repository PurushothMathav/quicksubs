1
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.200
The Empress Dowager is here.

2
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.800
Let him in. Yes.

3
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.566
I’ve met the Empress Dowager.

4
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.400
Empress Dowager, may you have peace and longevity.

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Please rise.

6
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.400
What brings you to visit this old body today?

7
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.466
Why does the Empress Dowager ask knowingly?

8
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.466
It’s very simple.

9
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:48.400
This old body needs you to help me get rid of Consort Yang.

10
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.433
That might be difficult.

11
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.500
After all, the Emperor still deeply loves Consort Yang.

12
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.166
Then it depends on your ability.

13
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
Consort Yan’s ambitions and schemes

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.633
must be dealt with. Just say whether you will do it or not.

15
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.566
Ah, I’ll do it.

16
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:12.966
But

17
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.633
I have a condition.

18
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.466
What is it?

19
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.400
My condition is

20
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.300
that once it’s done, I can leave the palace.

21
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.666
Why?

22
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.500
In my life,

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.833
I don’t want to waste it within the palace walls.

24
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.700
Compared to wealth and honor,

25
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.466
I only desire peace and happiness.

26
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.766
A lifetime of health.

27
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.900
Your family.

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.433
It’s the first time I’ve heard such a novel idea.

29
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.866
Very well, this old body agrees.

30
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:43.666
You

31
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.566
The consort has already been sent to the cold palace.

32
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.300
There’s no chance of a comeback.

33
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.800
According to our previous agreement,

34
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.066
the matter is accomplished.

35
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.800
Shouldn’t you let me leave the palace now?

36
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.700
What rewards did the Emperor give you recently?

37
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:02.366
Ah, just some ordinary things.

38
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.466
I’ll need to think about this matter a bit more.

39
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.966
You may go for now.

40
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:08.400
Yes.

41
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.766
I’ll take my leave.

42
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.233
In the end, I overestimated everything.

43
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.866
What exactly is the Empress Dowager thinking?
