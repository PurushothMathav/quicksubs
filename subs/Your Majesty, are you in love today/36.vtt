00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.266
Tell me everything you’ve recently seen around Concubine Rong.

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.966
Be detailed and thorough.

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.233
Usually, the Empress spends her time in the inner palace handling official matters.

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.966
Except for the day of the death of Consort Zhou,

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.066
the Empress suddenly said she wanted to move to the Shu Xiu Palace.

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.200
And there was a gap.

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.200
She told the maid to closely watch the Consort Zhao Yi.

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.700
Other than that, there was no unusual behavior.

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.366
Did she tell you why? No.

10
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.866
The Empress is awake.

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.433
The Empress is awake.

12
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.833
Concubine Rong, you’re awake.

13
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.300
Are you still uncomfortable?

14
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:39.866
Does the wound hurt?

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.900
My head hurts so much, Imperial Physician.

16
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.666
Quickly relieve Concubine Rong’s pain.

17
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200
Your Majesty, Concubine Rong’s internal injuries

18
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.000
make it difficult to administer medication.

19
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.033
It’s fine.

20
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.566
I will endure it.

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700
By the way, how is Princess Loulan?

22
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.200
She is doing well.

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.500
But how did you know someone wanted to harm Princess Loulan?

24
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.066
Did she discover something?

25
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.700
Rebirth is inexplicable.

26
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.433
I must not let her know.

27
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.100
Did I dream this?

28
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.800
In my dream, I saw Princess Loulan.

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.166
Princess Loulan was bleeding profusely,

30
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200
saying she died so wrongfully.

31
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.766
I’m so scared.

32
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.033
It was a dream.

33
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.100
Princess Loulan died from poisoning in her previous life.

34
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.200
In this life, she almost got hit by a lamp.

35
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.033
It does align with the dream’s content.

36
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:27.800
Was it really just a dream?

37
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.566
Your Majesty, in my previous life, I led a campaign.

38
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.800
It was a great victory.

39
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.700
I didn’t take this matter seriously.

40
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.100
But the Empress is lonely.

41
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.033
We resolved the problem from the root.

42
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.600
I was careless. You should rest well.

43
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.233
I won’t spare anyone who harmed you.
