00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.966
You’ve harmed me terribly.

2
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.033
Why are you blaming me?

3
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.466
Why are you accusing me?

4
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.400
If it’s not me, don’t come looking for me.

5
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.666
Then go find Lin Guiren. Why are you supporting me?

6
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.133
I don’t know anything.

7
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.500
Blame it on the master. Go find him and don’t come to me.

8
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.566
Ah, perfect.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.766
Ah, Your Majesty.

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.666
We’re both exhausted.

11
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.166
Your Majesty, spare me.

12
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.533
I was just confused for a moment.

13
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.166
Your Majesty, please spare me.

14
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Get someone to take Chun Lan back to Cining Palace.

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.000
No!

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
No!

17
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.066
No!

18
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.866
Please spare me!

19
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.833
Your Majesty, please spare me.

20
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.466
Chun Lan, I’ll take her back and report.

21
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.533
Lin Guiren will be dealt with by Your Majesty and the Empress.

22
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.700
It’s getting late.

23
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.133
We should avoid disturbing the Empress Dowager.

24
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.000
Wait until dawn.

25
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.633
I’ll personally have him thrown into the dungeon.
