1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.800
Your Majesty, the epidemic is raging fiercely.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.133
The plague is rampant in Lingnan.

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.766
The people are displaced.

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.166
If there are no effective measures,

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.000
I fear it will spread uncontrollably across the country.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.466
The people are suffering.

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.900
Do any of the ministers have good ideas?

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.266
Replying to Your Majesty,

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.900
This epidemic originated from the southern regions.

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.733
I suggest immediately sealing off the area.

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.633
Anyone trying to leave should be shot.

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.500
Sealing off the city is feasible,

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.666
but we must not indiscriminately kill the innocent.

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.000
Issue my orders.

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.900
Immediately organize the transportation of supplies and resources.

16
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.000
At the same time, dispatch elite troops for protection.

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.600
After sealing off the city,

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.033
promptly deploy supplies.

19
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.066
Ensure the basic needs of the people in the city.

20
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.966
Additionally, set up isolation areas outside the city.

21
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.800
Prevent the spread of the plague.

22
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.433
In the previous life, we failed to control the epidemic.

23
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.666
Our treasury was depleted.

24
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:53.833
This time, I must prepare thoroughly.

25
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.633
Additionally, I have decided to personally visit the affected area.

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.266
To boost the people’s confidence in resisting the plague.

27
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.066
We cannot afford to—

28
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.900
Your Majesty, how can you risk yourself by going alone?

29
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.700
The court cannot be without a ruler even for a single day.

30
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.133
Furthermore, Your Majesty, you must not risk yourself.

31
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.866
Please reconsider.

32
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.033
I hope Your Majesty will think this through.

33
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.300
Your Majesty, I believe that in the southern chaos,

34
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.433
local officials are powerless.

35
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.533
We urgently need someone who is both brave and wise,

36
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.466
and who can represent Your Majesty’s authority in the south.

37
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.300
To help the people in their time of crisis.

38
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:31.866
Oh?

39
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.566
Is there any minister

40
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.833
willing to go in my place?

41
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.566
How is it that in our great Liang, there are so many talented individuals,

42
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.433
yet all are too afraid to risk their lives?

43
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:46.966
Chen Dingyuan will go.

44
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.066
Prince Rui, why have you come?
