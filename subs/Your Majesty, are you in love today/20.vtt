00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:04.500
Didn’t you both say that Consort Rong was just a scapegoat?

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.866
You just said that the Zhanzhou consort drowned in the lake.

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.233
Are you sure there’s no evidence left?

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.900
The servant tampered with her heart.

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.400
Even if armed forces come, it can only be judged as a disappearance or drowning.

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.833
Why did the Emperor transfer the authority to Consort Rong?

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.066
Has he discovered something?

8
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.800
Consort,

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.066
The Empress Dowager requests you.

10
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.166
I’ve seen His Majesty.

11
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.233
Empress Dowager, please rise.

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.466
Do you know someone has died in the palace?

13
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.600
What death?

14
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.233
What exactly happened?

15
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.000
Half an hour ago,

16
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.100
Consort Rong discovered that Zhou Caixian drowned in the water.

17
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.100
This happened in the previous life as well.

18
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:02.033
At that time, the investigation by the Consort concluded it was an accidental drowning.

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.766
Who was Zhou Caixian?

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.566
Consort,

21
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.366
It seems she was a newcomer who entered the palace at the same time as Consort Rong.

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.033
Oh, she entered the palace with Consort Rong?

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.900
The new sisters who just entered the palace,

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.433
I haven’t even seen them.

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.033
Daoist Rongfu.

26
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.766
Enough, I’ll ask you.

27
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.000
After dinner today,

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.166
Did you or your people leave the Zhongcui Palace?

29
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.566
After dinner, I was in the palace all the time.

30
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.033
I didn’t go out.

31
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.100
As for the people in my palace,

32
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.200
I usually don’t manage them much.

33
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.800
I’ll need to investigate to know for sure.

34
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.100
Report to the Emperor,

35
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.066
No wounds were found on Zhou Caixian.

36
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.433
From the mud on the soles of her shoes,

37
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.233
It looks like an accidental drowning.

38
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.266
It’s exactly the same as in the previous life.

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.166
Bring Lin Guiren up.

40
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.300
Greetings to the Emperor.

41
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.866
Greetings to the Empress Dowager.

42
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.100
Please don’t kill me, I’m innocent.

43
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.833
I’m wronged.

44
00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:07.166
Who wants to kill you?
