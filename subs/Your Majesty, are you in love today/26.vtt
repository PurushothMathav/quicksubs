00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.233
Where is the evidence?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.266
Hospital.

3
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.866
It is well-known

4
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:10.966
that Cuixin Lake

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.166
is the main route to the Imperial Kitchen for Lord Zhongcui.

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.300
On the night of the incident,

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Consort Yan

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.766
went to the Imperial Kitchen and requested a bowl of silver fungus and lotus seed porridge.

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.466
I was hungry,

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.866
so I had someone from the Imperial Kitchen bring it to me.

11
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.533
Is there a problem with that?

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.866
Besides, you know

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.266
that it says here 3 grams of food.

14
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.233
At that time,

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.400
Consort Zhou's body had already been discovered by you, right?

16
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.100
But before that,

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.300
Consort Yan requested the silver fungus and lotus seed porridge.

18
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.200
It would have been sent to the Imperial Kitchen.

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.133
So the time before it matches the time of the incident.

20
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.000
Your Majesty,

21
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.566
I found bloodstains on the plants by the lake.

22
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.400
They should be left by the culprit.

23
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.633
Let’s check them out.

24
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.866
Master Li, bring some water.

25
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.833
Eunuch Ruofeng, please.

26
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.200
It has melted, it has melted.

27
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.366
It really melted.

28
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.000
Don’t even think about escaping.

29
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.300
That mastermind was someone I used to be close with before.

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.066
He used the money I lent him to attack the consort.

31
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.800
I was forced to kill him.

32
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300
You, you...

33
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.500
How could you betray me

34
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.766
and commit such a heinous act?

35
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.066
I trusted you wholeheartedly.

36
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.233
It’s all my fault.

37
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.266
I deserve to die.

38
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:49.000
Your Highness, I am deeply ashamed of my failure.

39
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.066
If there is a next life,

40
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.000
I will repay you by being a loyal servant.

41
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.100
Ah, stop him!

42
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.266
He’s dead, drag him away.

43
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.066
Someone!

44
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.200
Your Majesty, it’s all my fault.

45
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.000
Please punish me.
