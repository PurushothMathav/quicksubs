00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.200
If he had been obedient and left the palace,

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.266
he wouldn’t have ended up like this.

3
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.366
Each consort has her own way of handling things.

4
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.733
He framed you first.

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.433
He got what he deserved.

6
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.733
This is something the Emperor specially sent over yesterday.

7
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.866
From the Inner Court.

8
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:32.833
Sister Shu, do you want to throw it away?

9
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.400
The Emperor almost wronged you because he believed malicious gossip.

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.733
You’re in a bad mood.

11
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.600
This... this neck lock,

12
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.066
is it really necessary?

13
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.800
Ah, keep it.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.233
We’ll take it out when you’re in a better mood.

15
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.566
Yuan,

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.900
the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet is approaching.

17
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Go to the Medical Bureau.

18
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.366
Have them prepare some new clothes.

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.600
Ah.

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.233
Hey.

21
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.800
Is this Consort Yan?

22
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.366
Now she’s a palace consort.

23
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.100
Not bad, keep up the good work.

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.700
In a little while,

25
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.600
it will be the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet.

26
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.500
At the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet,

27
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.766
Princess Loulan had an accident.

28
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:24.300
Then Loulan rebelled.

29
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.466
Although the dog emperor defeated Loulan,

30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.566
there was

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.833
a plague afterwards.

32
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.866
So,

33
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.933
the root of all this is still

34
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:37.866
Princess Loulan.

35
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.766
This time, we must prevent it in advance,

36
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.466
otherwise,

37
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.633
the common people will suffer.

38
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.900
Your Majesty, regarding the previous matter,

39
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.000
they said they couldn’t make clothes for the consorts.

40
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.100
You’ll have to figure it out yourself.

41
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.266
They dare to refuse to work.
