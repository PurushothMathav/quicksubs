00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.866
how dare you humiliate Jack

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.833
in front of this city's wealthiest people

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.333
what are you talking about

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.466
I was just telling grandma how you got Nathan

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.300
first off at Jack at the auction

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.166
I didn't do anything like that

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.000
doesn't matter

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.400
your engagement to Jack is a family matter

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.466
it was your grandpa's final wish

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.700
how dare you not respect that mom

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.466
we got here as soon as we could

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.066
don't call me that you don't deserve to bury the rose

13
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.800
name both of you

14
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.266
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree

15
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.500
especially the rotten ones

16
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.200
I'm sorry I don't know what happened

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.966
but I'm sure we can figure this out

18
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.266
ask your daughter what happened

19
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.066
she accepted that hideous diamond from Nathan Forbes

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.500
embarrassing our Jack now

21
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.466
everyone's gonna think of her as a gold digger

22
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.300
with no shame

23
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:01.866
oh if only you could be more like Connie

24
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.900
more like Connie you mean more like a homewrecker

25
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.400
what
