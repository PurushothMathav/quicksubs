1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.400
do you think marriage is a joke

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.000
you think it's child's play

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.500
I don't understand

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.500
you think you can marry somebody one day

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.266
and then marry somebody else the next

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.433
I don't think that

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.866
but that's what Connie thinks of my marriage

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.166
perhaps you should ask her grandma

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.233
Connie and Jack are young

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.000
young people make mistakes

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.866
especially in love

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.400
but marriage is so much more than that

13
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:32.033
you're right marriage is commitment

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.666
it's partnership it's companionship

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:38.866
it's honesty and trust and Jack broke all of that

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.300
so you think I should just be okay with you Marin

17
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.866
Nathan Forbes

18
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.700
all of a sudden he doesn't even have a job

19
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.200
this is the latest congressional poll

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.533
grammar rose as you can see

21
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.766
after the Taylor Burn diamond incident

22
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.400
and well

23
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.500
today's event went viral

24
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.033
Nathan has the undeniable lead

25
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.033
it's gonna be a congressman in no time

26
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.666
and Jack

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.833
will be a nobody for the rest of his life
