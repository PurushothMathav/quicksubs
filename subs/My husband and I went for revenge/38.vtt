1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.833
why would I wanna run for Congress

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.766
because you've been thinking about it

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.800
and because you secretly care about things

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.800
like gun control climate change and stray dogs

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.900
but don't show it how did you know that

6
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.666
I know a lot more about you than you think Nathan

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.700
deep down you thought about running for Congress

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.100
and you actually think you can make a difference

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.866
we started being something more than just rich

10
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.900
good for nothing

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.000
but so what why now

12
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.300
I'm not ready

13
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.033
I can help you I will help you win

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.700
is that so

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.433
and what's in it for you Miss Rose

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.033
