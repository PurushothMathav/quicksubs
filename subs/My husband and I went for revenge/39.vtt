00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.300
I mean business wise

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.166
of course

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.066
I need you to help me destroy Jack completely

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.066
and I wanna make sure you get something in return

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.866
you know you scratch my back

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.666
I'll scratch yours really

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.200
that's it so you just wanna scratch my back

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.100
nothing more

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.400
nothing more I don't think I can

10
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.633
I'm sorry Nathan it's okay

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.966
you got a deal

12
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.200
good good

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.300
I'll have someone contact you to set up a meeting

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.500
but I think

15
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500
we should aim to announce it at my mother's birthday

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.633
ball next week

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.200
next week how long have you been planning this for

18
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.766
long enough do you trust me

19
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.033
not on a scooter but yes

20
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.600
I'll be there be don't worry

21
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.633
how's the missus

22
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.366
seems like I was just overthinking

23
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.566
really was just transactional for

24
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.666
and it's not for you

25
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.600
I'll be damned

26
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.266
the great Nathan Forbes is in love

27
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.700
