00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm glad you two are having a grand old time

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.400
but the heck did you do to my mother

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.500
honey it is not Blair's fault

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.700
it is all my no

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.000
no it is my fault dad

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.133
I called grandma out on everything

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:16.900
and she couldn't handle it

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.400
look where

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.966
you know Grandma's always had something against us

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.966
she thinks that if Timmy didn't die I know

11
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.333
she thinks that if Uncle Timmy didn't die

12
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.466
that he would be the leader of this family

13
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:40.000
this company and he would do a better job than you

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.933
but she's wrong just because he was her favorite

15
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.633
doesn't mean he's any better than you

16
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.233
I guess I never realized you knew so much

17
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.000
and you never really cared about family politics

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.833
I used to think that

19
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.933
treating everyone who wronged us with empathy

20
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.166
could change them

21
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
but I was wrong

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.166
it only takes away their guilt

23
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.400
it is a wonder that you know such a sad truth at 23

24
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.233
but I guess I'm glad you're realizing it early

25
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.266
does that mean you forgive me

26
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.300
for being the worst granddaughter in the world

27
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.700
oh I suppose

28
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.966
since you are the best daughter in the world

29
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.766
what's going on
