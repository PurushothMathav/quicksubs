00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.233
so you know how I'm running for Congress this year

2
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.500
well it's going well

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.666
I just

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.366
I realized that

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.800
before I make my first official public statement

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.700
I should probably rethink some big picture items

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.433
like what like hiring your staff

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.366
grassroots campaigns getting my public image in orders

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.533
all of that oh

10
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:36.800
so definitely not for things like partying or closer

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.600
what

12
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.066
no

13
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:43.200
look my people did some calculations

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.200
they determined that if you could chip in 2 million

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.000
it would really benefit my campaign

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.866
doesn't your entire campaign cost $2 million

17
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:55.966
what
