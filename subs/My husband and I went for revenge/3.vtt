00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.966
what makes you think that I'm a good person Blair

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.500
I don't I think you're a compulsive cheater

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
with commitment issues and no sense of responsibility

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.933
and you just asked to marry you

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:14.066
but you are the biggest pain in Jack's ass

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.766
and you guys have been enemies since forever

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.533
yeah he's had a crush on me

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:19.766
since

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.966
I won student body president over him in high school

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.566
but I don't get it what is this revenge

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.466
what did he do to you

12
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.533
I thought you'd be more interested in what you

13
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.633
get out of all this

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.366
I never knew you were so calculative

15
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.366
I wasn't before and it cost me

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.166
listen I can help you get to where you wanna be

17
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.700
let me just imagine me by your side instead of jacks

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.666
it all sounds very rosy Miss Rose

19
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.966
but I don't trust you yet

20
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.700
maybe I would think that you actually wanna marry me

21
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
and that you like me as a person if you

22
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.100
if you gave me a little kiss

23
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:05.100
I've never kissed anyone before besides Jack

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.266
clock stick

25
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.366
fine just stupid kiss on the cheek

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.400

27
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:16.933
alright look

28
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.866
look maybe uh

29
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.800
maybe Abby was right maybe you have a concussion here

30
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.100
for your medical costs

31
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.733
and whatever car you decide to buy

32
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.000
to replace this thing

33
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.566
alright that's my cue

34
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.666
I'll leave I'll be in touch

35
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:39.066
I'm sorry I hit you guys and I'm glad you're alive

36
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.266
you fuck boy get away from my innocent player

37
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:44.166
I can't believe he did that to you

38
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.666
knows what kind of disease

39
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.866

40
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.800
and everything is gonna be okay this time

41
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.066
okay

42
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.433
you definitely hit your head

43
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.100
do you think the car will still drive

44
00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:01.766
I need to go home and

45
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.100
