00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.800
Master, why are you here?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.966
If we don't come, you're going to break the sky

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.733
Wan'er dare not

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.900
Also ask the master to play Mr. Baojiamu

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.700
presumptuous

6
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.366
He is a martial artist

7
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.700
No one can hit him yet

8
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.666
Uh no

9
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.766
Hum, this king's apprentice

10
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.600
When did you become a trash?

11
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.766
The traitor will not kneel down to this king

12
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.133
Master, please protect Mr. Lu

13
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.666
King Xuanbei has always been a strict teacher

14
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.833
How did you teach your apprentice to be so disobedient?

15
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.300
This king asks you again to let go

16
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.100
Let if the master refuses to say

17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.966
You don't have to do this

18
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.700
I can handle this.

19
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.466
I'll stop you later

20
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.900
You take your family and leave first

21
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.033
As loyal

22
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.466
You go fast

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:51.166
I didn't expect the master to attack me

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.100
as finished

25
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.266
To please

26
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.900
You even killed your own apprentice

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.033
This king will go back and explain to you

28
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.900
In that case, you don't have to survive
