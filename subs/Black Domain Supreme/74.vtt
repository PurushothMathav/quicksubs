00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.733
Zhang Xiaotian, a scattered person in the rivers and lakes, has seen you

2
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.566
Master Zhang is also known as Ghost Hand God

3
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.600
When the treasure appraisal is sure, you can stand alone in the world

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.866
Be polite to the Li family because of my invitation

5
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.900
Master Zhang of South East Asia

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.500
Be me Li Jia Keqing

7
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.366
Master Zhang will also teach disciples of the Li family

8
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.766
At this time, wouldn't it be a hundred years of new life to pass down the secret book?

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.300
Grandma, please promise him

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.933
I want to learn stone gambling from Master Zhang

11
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.466
Okay, thank you, Mr. Sun

12
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.900
My Li family haha

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.466
Don't worry, old lady

14
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.900
Isn't there a personal favor?

15
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.400
What if he moves out again?

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.633
Is it more powerful than Master Zhang?

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.433
Shen Weihou, don't worry.

18
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.366
The entire treasure appraisal world

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.200
No one can compare to my ghost hand Zhang Xiaotian

20
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.300
What Master Zhang said is very true

21
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.500
Don't say it's you

22
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.766
Just an ordinary treasure appraiser

23
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.900
This bastard

24
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.866
I don't have that resource to invite

25
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.900
Hey, this Mr. Lu is not simple

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.733
What if he is a skill himself?

27
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.866
Master Neng

28
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.200
Haha, no one.

29
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.233
Bring me all the rough stones in Jiangcheng

30
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.100
Brother, I can't be so selfish.

31
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.766
Let you take risks for me again and again

32
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.633
What do you want?

33
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.133
I am your man

34
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.633
Suddenly want to shelter you from the wind and rain

35
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.300
What's more, these people are now

36
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.466
Don't mention this helplessness

37
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.866
I really don't look good

38
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.033
Huh no no

39
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.166
I was wondering where to send me out for a while

40
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.466
I can't do everything myself
