00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.200
Temple of the Gods

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.466
You, a great master, should know

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.633
The Temple of the Gods is a constant pressure on major events

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.700
Temple of the Gods I know of course

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.400
But what is the Temple of the Gods Alliance?

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.300
presumptuous

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.066
It was created by those of us who came from the temples of the gods

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.433
Guard Outside the Temple of the Gods

9
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.700
Of course people like you are not qualified to enter

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.300
But how did I hear that people from the Temple of the Gods came out?

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.700
Have you all been in prison?

12
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.366
This dignified left prime minister

13
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.200
He actually went through the human fork too?

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.466
I beg you.

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.300
Stop contradicting the Buddha statue

16
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.933
Even if you don't think about yourself

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.066
Don't think about parents

18
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.866
Also think about emotions and Yaya, Dad

19
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.200
Pity the hearts of parents

20
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.600
Too bad the pool

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.300
Today is your day of death

22
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.433
It is the day of your Lu family's extinction

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.233
Since you said so

24
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.500
Then how can I not satisfy you?

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.400
I'll take care of you first.

26
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.633
Destroy the so-called Prime Minister's Mansion with your own hands

27
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.600
speak out

28
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.366
A mere master without initiative

29
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.600
How dare you be smaller than me?

30
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.800
You're too noisy.

31
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.500
Hey kill me

32
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.733
Or be beaten to death by me

33
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.366
Hahaha, okay, okay.

34
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.300
Ben Xiang has been fine for a long time

35
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.666
The world has forgotten my divinity, right?

36
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.033
Then you go to hell.
