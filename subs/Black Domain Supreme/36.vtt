00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.666
I give you my life, do you dare to take it?

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.366
I don't know what kind of blow you are?

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.466
You didn't even finish college

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.366
Tiger Lord, use my life to accompany you

5
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.366
My old man is firm

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.766
Use mine.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.966
Mom, dad, get up

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
So impressive

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.900
A poor family

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.833
Enough, do you think this is a vegetable market?

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.233
pick and choose

12
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.200
Your whole family has to die for me

13
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.600
Someone come to me

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.833
I don't know good or bad

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.033
Then I will fulfill you

16
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.666
Trash kill him for me

17
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.100
I'll hack you to death.

18
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
What are you doing?

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.466
Your son is much cuter than you

20
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.000
Do you want to die?

21
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.166
You die for me

22
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.566
Dad, I'm your son

23
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.833
Kneel down and apologize to Lord Lu

24
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.466
Leave me to say that I can't compare to him, okay?

25
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.866
He's the real deal.

26
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.200
It really pissed me off.

27
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.833
big brother

28
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.500
Just kill them

29
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.866
lose money in vain

30
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.400
Also cheaper for them

31
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.966
What do you want?

32
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.233
I'm going to make them never turn over

33
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.300
You can only live humbly

34
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.600
Until the last drop of blood is drained

35
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.933
Don't you have no money to accompany you?

36
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.833
Then be my slave for life in Lujiacun

37
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.600
Sleeping in a pigsty and eating dog food

38
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.266
Do the cheapest thing
