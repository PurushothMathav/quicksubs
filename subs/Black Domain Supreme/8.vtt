3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.000
I don't have time to pay attention to your feelings, I can't wait

4
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.333
Mr. Lu welcomes you except for the Four Heavenly Kings

5
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.200
The guards of Jiangcheng made the entry of Tianwang Ni

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.300
Special Yellow Dragon Temple to welcome you

7
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.366
I told you before.

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.200
No time, the Jiangcheng family will be there

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Veteran grandmasters should also be invited

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.600
Identify him

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.433
Go to my family

12
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.066
The fastest speed assisted is

13
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.800
Brother, I beg you, brother

14
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:50.433
I've been holding a grudge for so many years

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.200
Why should I?

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
The one who married you is the second child

17
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.200
Hahahaha kneel down for me

18
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.500
They say I wash my feet in slippers

19
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.333
Ha ha.

20
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:05.400
The old man doesn't forget his original intention, hahaha.

21
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.100
Luhan, you beast

22
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:12.500
Bastard, scold me hahaha

23
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.666
Oops, the old man said you are more promising than me

24
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.366
Survive today

25
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.466
Your son is dead too, you still have nothing to do

26
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.700
Didn't you promise to let us go?

27
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.800
Do you really believe it?

28
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.766
I lied to you.

29
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.900
The effect of the next door is still small

30
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.600
What are you still doing?

31
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.500
Drag it out alive hahaha

32
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.166
No, let me go, let me go

33
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.433

35
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:50.466
Blame the old man on your useless son

36
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:55.400
Hahaha ah ah ah ah

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:04.900
Leave your aunt alone

40
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.033
She's just an old woman

41
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:10.233
Stinky comrade

42
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.066
Brother, how could you have the heart to let you go on the road by yourself?

43
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.600
You just go on your way

44
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.100
Hahaha I will be rich aha

45
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.166
