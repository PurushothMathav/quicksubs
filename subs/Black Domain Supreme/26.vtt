1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.666
Just you trash

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.666
Command family

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.266
Then I'll give you a chance too.

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.100
As long as you pay for your legs

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.533
For the sake of Lord Liu

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.033
Spare your life

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.100
The hero is so brave

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.166
Legs at your own expense

9
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.166
Legs at your own expense

10
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.100
Legs at your own expense

11
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.666
Do you hear me?

12
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.766
Just because you still want to treat your ancestors?

13
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.933
Give you a chance and don't mess with me

14
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.200
The character of watching the play

15
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.166
Then only immortality

16
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.100
The emperor was angry

17
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.000
Serve millions

18
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.600
The owner is angry

19
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.933
Mr. Wei calms down

20
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.033
Wu and Sun Cui apologize

21
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.866
Are you crazy?

22
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.466
For such an outsider

23
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.900
You and my grandson shut up

24
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.233
Did you take it? Did you hear what Mr. Lu said?

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.900
What are you doing?

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.200
Save me, it's blue sky

27
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.500
Stop it

28
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.800
Think about it.

29
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.166
Is the Sun family important or Sun Qiang important?

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.066
Who the hell is he?

31
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.466
You let go, we let go.

32
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.433
Doctor Sun dares to speak directly

33
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.766
Can now answer my virus

34
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.433
Where is the big tooth

35
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.266
Very good and

36
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.200
You do it for me too

37
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:44.333
No one died.

38
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.433
Concubine forgive me

39
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:47.300
Don't go overboard.

40
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.166
Don't talk so much money

41
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.100
By the way, he has already scrapped four batches.

42
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.500
Now you only have to step on your 5th stick

43
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.866
I'll count you as useless
