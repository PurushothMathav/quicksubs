00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Sir?

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.500
I don't want to give you a happy life.

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.900
I want to compensate

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.066
Lu Yun

5
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.266
These gifts are yours, these are congratulatory gifts.

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.466
I will prepare another bride price.

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.200
What? These gifts are all sent by Lu Yun.

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.833
Compared to these gifts

9
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.733
These gifts from the Sun family are not on the table at all

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.366
We have a 10 billion contract

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.133
He is 100 times the size of the Sun family

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.200
How much more?

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.566
Or the famous book of Hengyuan Group as a gift in person

14
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.533
Famous book Lu Yun, you didn't brag

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.166
I knew you could cure Xueqing's illness

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.666
Must not be an ordinary person

17
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.900
I don't think so. It seems that Xueqing is not a stupid girl

18
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.600
He has a better eye than most people

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.533
Impossible. He's a rural beggar

20
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.900
How could I possibly come up with these to disappoint you?

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.033
But I just took out enough

22
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.966
If you really have this ability

23
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.500
You're going to be a duck.

24
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.366
I will still be bitter haha after retiring for three years

25
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.800
What's not just my 1%?

26
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.433
Mr. Sun can't accept it

27
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.566
These gifts are genuine.

28
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.866
But it must not be you who accepts it.

29
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.300
Hengyuan Group is not related to you

30
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.266
Why give you 10 billion

31
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.166
Girl, this is a bad joke

32
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.866
Don't worry, it's all king.

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.600
Some of these people don't believe it

34
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.066
Then you say it yourself

35
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.500
Who arranged these gifts?
