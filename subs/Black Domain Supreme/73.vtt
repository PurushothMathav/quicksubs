00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.066
Hello mom

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.066
He wasn't lying.

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.200
He really didn't lie.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.500
Impossible this is impossible

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.100
Grandma, are you not dead?

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.466
Of course not.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.966
Is this really all right?

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.966
Thanks for being alone

9
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.833
Saved my wife's life again

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.966
Grandma didn't save you alone

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.533
One is that Lu Yun saved you

12
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.766
Yes, it's Lu Yun.

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.633
Nonsense how could he save me

14
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.866
Ask Lu Cun to take action

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.200
I would like to offer the book property

16
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.000
Me, too!

17
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.800
How come?

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.366
He really saved me

19
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.300
It seems that this game is

20
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.966
Some people should owe their classmates

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.200
Don't go too far.

22
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.433
Why don't you dare?

23
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.233
Chen Weiwu also asked to solve the matter

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.466
What are you doing in the rivers and lakes?

25
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.300
Come on.

26
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:07.466
Live oops oops oops oops oops

27
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.700
As expected of a top authority

28
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.700
What a waste

29
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.133
Don't think it's great to know the enemy

30
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.200
I'll tell you what.

31
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.066
I can make the wooden gun give alms with the tip of my palm

32
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.033
Sun Shao said that even if he meets you

33
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.300
Like a firefly that ends in the bright moon

34
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.900
So what did I grab?

35
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.600
You dare to die early

36
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.566
It seems that you still don't understand your father

37
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.866
The disparity between mothers

38
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.033
Then continue

39
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.266
I want to see you kneel on the ground and give up

40
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.566
The good fortune of your Li family is here

41
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.133
My second gift

42
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:45.166
It is to grant you a century of prosperity for the Li family
