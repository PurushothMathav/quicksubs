00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.933
Yo

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.400
Here you are, you wimp

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.900
I will move, I will move, how dare you go?

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.000
You little beast

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.466
How dare you hit me?

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.100
If you dare to hit my concubine, you will die.

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.400
Bullying my parents

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.766
How dare you show up in front of me

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.400
What are you so arrogant about?

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.633
Don't make trouble, sister-in-law, calm down

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.600
Xiaoyun, he didn't mean it, I bah

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.766
Wait to die

13
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.166
My big brother Su Hu will be here soon.

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.833
Wait for him to clean you up

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.900
How did it go?

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.066
No more pain, no more pain

17
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.100
It doesn't hurt, that little beast, are you deaf?

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.766
Can you hear what I'm saying?

19
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.366
Hu Ma, don't be angry.

20
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.766
He's just a dog outside, right?

21
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.833
Dogs don't rely on people

22
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.266
Dogs look down on people

23
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.833
Really unpromising

24
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.533
He actually treated me like a dog

25
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.300
But it pays us 5 million

26
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.866
I'm going to be disappointed

27
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.600
He is an abandoned wild dog

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.766
Trash, you don't know yet

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.766
Your mistress has long since left Jiangcheng

30
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.266
I didn't want to take you at all

31
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.766
See how crazy you are

32
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.966
And trash

33
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.600
I have something for him to do

34
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.566
Of course he wants money.

35
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.000
As for 5 million me a phone call

36
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.866
Let's send it to me.

37
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.333
But what are you?

38
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.900
You can have my money

39
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.033
kill for life

40
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.833
debt repayment

41
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:46.266
Boss, my little sister just asked you to lose money.

42
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:47.700
Dare not pay
