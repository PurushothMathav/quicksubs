00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.566
My classmates don't remember me

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.066
I was your high school deskmate.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.533
He is a fraudster

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.400
He has a strong boyfriend

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.266
I can't even remember my poor studies

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.800
Why do you still remember you?

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.166
Boyfriend

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:18.766
Yeah, the performance three years ago was amazing

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.100
Female classmates are shameless

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.633
In front of everyone?

11
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.333
This fraudster

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.133
People come people

13
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.800
You let go, you dare to touch our guests

14
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.133
I can't afford the consequences of group me in

15
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.066
You still want to fight, right?

16
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.166
What are you arrogant as a fraudster?

17
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.366
If you want to go in, you can take out the invitation

18
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.133
But hurry up.

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.566
We'll go in and wait for you to save us.

20
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.300
Let's talk about your years as a duck

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.600
Hahahaha

22
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.866
What can he do to a fraudster?

23
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.700
Can you have a landlord's feast?

24
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.333
Oh, just wait there

25
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.366
Wait for me to pick up some leftovers.

26
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.000
Which grandma dog has been fed recently that is not a lung?

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.166
Hahahahaha, no dog can rob you.

28
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.666
Hahahaha

29
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.066
Isn't a person's random fee just an invitation?

30
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.166
Who takes me if I don't

31
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.566
No one in this world is entitled to

32
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.900
Ah!

33
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.433
crumpled

34
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.566
How dare you say invitation?

35
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.300
Here is your invitation.

36
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:33.766
Hahaha, just a piece of broken paper is said to be an invitation.

37
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:34.733
Yellow Dragon Feast

38
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.400
It's not a cat and a dog like you that can respect you

39
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.000
Airplane invitation?
