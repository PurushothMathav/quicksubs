00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.433
You scum you let go

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.066
daughter

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.533
What a poor daughter

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.633
Are you a person?

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.800
Xueqing trusts you so much, so you toss him like this

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.900
Go

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.600
Okay, Xueqing's illness has entered

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
You really take us for fools, don't you?

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.133
You made these two gestures.

10
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.366
Is Xueqing's illness cured?

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.833
What kind of life did you live in your house?

12
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.400
You don't even think of me as my brother. Get out of here

13
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.533
To prevent me from treating our daughter

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.333
Ha ha.

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.233
Ha ha.

16
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.566
Nonsense, I have been treating diseases like this since I was a child

17
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.200
If rural people are rural people

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.800
High-profile god, hahaha.

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.966
You will not understand my methods

20
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.666
I said it's fine

21
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.333
Xueqing will wake up soon

22
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.566
Leave this dream

23
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.200
If you can really cure it

24
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.200
I'll give you something to kneel down and kowtow to

25
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.033
Too bad he can't get better and he should die, you two

26
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.500
If you want to eat well, you have to kill him yourself

27
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.600
Great, what's not good?

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.166
How can it be cured?

29
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.066
Isn't it bad enough?

30
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.533
Just deliberately blocked us from saving our daughter

31
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.300
Security guard

32
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.966
I'm taking this guy out

33
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.500
Wow

34
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.166
Where is this?

35
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.433
Why do you feel like you slept for a long time?
