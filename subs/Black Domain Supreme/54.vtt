00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.900
You... you can't kill me

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.333
Do you think he is really stupid?

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.433
Tell you

4
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.400
Tier 1 hospital diagnosed him as evil

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.300
blocked nerve

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.100
Treatment is extremely difficult

7
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.900
If you don't transplant it, you will die

8
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.933
Stop! Do you want to kill Xu Qing?

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.566
None of the three hospitals accept it.

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.500
We can only hope for the Sun family

11
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.233
Sun Xiong said that he hired the first genius doctor of Great Xia

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.600
I beg you

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.600
Let me abide

14
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.866
Leave the Li family

15
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.566
Xue Xing's illness was delayed for many years

16
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.266
It's really complicated.

17
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.933
But I will cure him with my own hands

18
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.566
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.800
How many doctors and experts say there is no cure?

20
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.533
How can an ordinary person like you cure him?

21
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.166
Serum disease is so serious, are you kidding me?

22
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.300
You don't have him in your heart at all

23
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.833
Your family uses him as a fertility tool

24
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.900
Ha ha.

25
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.166
Hey, I don't have a medical qualification certificate.

26
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.866
I haven't even read the suicide note

27
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.266
Disease is unknown

28
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.566
And praise the dwarf dog to treat him

29
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.400
What do you want?

30
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.366
Why haven't you come yet?

31
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.400
I'm going to kill them all

32
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.900
Since you don't believe me

33
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.566
Then I'll cure the serum first

34
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.966
Deal with this scumbag again

35
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.833
Just by you

36
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
How come this silly woman, don't mess around?

37
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.966
Why don't we be polite and want to send Xueqin?

38
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.600
I won't let you touch my daughter

39
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.200
Let me go

40
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.400
I will never love Xueqin

41
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.966
Go to sleep

42
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.766
Just wake up.

43
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:52.400
Haha, this is what you call healing

44
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.900
Do you want to jump on a big rope?

45
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.766
Drinking a bowl of floating water

46
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:59.433
Look at rural dogs like you

47
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.700
Our mesh number

48
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:03.466
What kind of garlic do you pack?

49
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.033
How can there be such a cure?
