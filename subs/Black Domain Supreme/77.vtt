00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.100
This light

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.433
Frozen uterine orchid

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.033
What? How?

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.900
I took a look at all the academicians

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.700
How can the uterine orchid exceed my eyes?

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.100
Do you understand or not?

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.366
That woman has been stupid for more than ten years

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.766
How can you tell whether a violet is or not?

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.366
If you don't know when you open it, you will continue to open it.

10
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.233
Purple Poland is Purple Poland

11
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.266
Worth far more than a dozen billion

12
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.666
Ah, how is that possible?

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.833
Why should he drive out violets?

14
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.100
That's not possible.

15
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.766
Must be fake

16
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.500
I actually opened a violet

17
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.833
Nice, you drove it out. Go

18
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.933
Xueqing will do this again

19
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.800
I should be Mr. Li

20
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.500
Haha, of course.

21
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.900
She's my daughter.

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.100
Ok ok ok ok

23
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.766
I left you 15 years ago, and you deserve to die

24
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.133
Why do you have the ability to live

25
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.400
If I live this time, I will definitely die

26
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.200
Home belongs to me

27
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.066
Okay, stop arguing

28
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.400
How do you do it?

29
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.866
Let you, a stupid woman, fire Froran?

30
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.600
Yeah! How did you do that?

31
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.200
Ten minutes everywhere gambler master

32
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.800
How did you get it out?

33
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.833
Is the customer irrelevant to you?

34
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:25.366
You should fulfill the promise, haha.
