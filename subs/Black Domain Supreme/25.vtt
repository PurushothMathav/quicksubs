1
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.600
How can I talk to Mr. Lu?

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.366
Mr. Lu, what are you doing?

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.766
He's just garbage.

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.600
shut up

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.100
Mr. Lu is my guest

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.700
How dare you disrespect Mr. Lu

7
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.800
Mr. Lu, forgive me

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.000
Liu was not well received

9
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.966
How could he?

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.200
All of you apologize to Mr. Lu immediately

11
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.800
Mr. Lu's personality

12
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.133
As expected of a guard

13
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.166
An apology is a mage

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.733
Then I'm destroyed.

15
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.700
Wait for the aristocratic family to go to the grave to apologize

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.500
Stop pretending

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.066
I know your Lu family best

18
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.600
I've been with you for five years

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.800
Your whole family is country old

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.133
I can't even afford a mixed house

21
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.500
You scammer

22
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Lied to Liu Zhen, right?

23
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.166
Boy, I advise you to do it yourself

24
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.600
If it weren't for Liu Zhenshou

25
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.466
You are not qualified to participate in this Yellow Dragon Feast at all

26
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.200
Even if your identity is not complete

27
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.200
Do you want to be the enemy of our Jiangcheng family?

28
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.966
Is wrong my enemy

29
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.233
You are not qualified

30
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:23.300
Haha, you really know how to pretend. Come here.

31
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.833
I have something to say.

32
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.000
What are you?

33
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.300
You really think of yourself as a character, don't you?

34
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.400
I originally promised to invite you to watch the play

35
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.100
Don't worry, then I'll keep my promise

36
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:38.666
Listen to me

37
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.600
Don't talk about me not giving you a chance

38
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.333
All of you.

39
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.833
Including Sun Xiong

40
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.766
Who crippled him today?

41
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.700
I will spare anyone

42
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.900
Hahahaha
