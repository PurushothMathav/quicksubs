00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.400
Pardon me?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.333
Just missing an excuse to change the blue blood endorsement

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.333
Thank you for sending me without my visit to Nankai University skylight

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.933
Everyone will blame Tang

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.466
You still have to die

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.266
Really? Did you see the director?

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.900
Production sponsors, someone's coming for you

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.500
No way, you shouldn't.

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.600
Otherwise, why do you think Song Zhi is in chaos?

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.866
You find the queen of hard work to replace me

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:26.733
Are you crazy?

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.066
Is the diva giving her debut enough topic?

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.366
Is the rolling level enough?

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.066
The production team's face is smiling crooked, who has time to care about you?

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.133
humiliate yourself

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.400
Impossible. I'm Huadan

17
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:38.766
Menghua gall

18
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.266
When you cheated on me with Song Yuchuan

19
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.466
Ruin my life

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.400
When you owe me dignity

21
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.433
You should think that your good days are over

22
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.566
Cut you

23
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.666
Go away go away

24
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.066
It's you who makes your life worse than death

25
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.200
Much better. Thank you, Miss Tao.

26
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.300
Good search

27
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.300
I remember you.

28
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.033
Sir, what are you doing here?

29
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.500
Yunchuan

30
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.500
The room is gone.

31
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.533
No endorsements

32
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.966
Basketball commercials are gone

33
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.900
It's all diabetes

34
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.800
I must kill him

35
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.500
It's okay, isn't it just a few endorsement ads?

36
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.966
I'll take it back for you.

37
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.200
What do you mean?

38
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.866
Don't worry, I'm confident this time.

39
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.800
Let him kneel down and beg the black-hearted Tang family to CP for me

40
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.266
Ask if Black Heart Down is for my CP.

41
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.900
Black heart Down for my CP
