00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.266
Hey, Secretary Zhu, forget the first two

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.066
This third gift

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.500
Li Jia doesn't deserve our pride, right?

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.533
Did you know

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.766
This is an emergency order from the board

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.633
You don't need to go through any process.

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.466
Is Li Jia a big shot?

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.700
If I could also climb Hengyuan

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.200
Can also rise step by step

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.366
It's me, I'll arrange the fleet now

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.266
Pull your hand away

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.233
Don't get my clothes dirty

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.766
You rubbish

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.366
How dare you push me

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.366
Baili Crane will have it

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.766
It's your Sun family that doesn't deserve to steal my marriage

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.533
How dare you tell our Li family to say goodbye

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.100
Brother Li told this garbage

19
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.000
Who doesn't deserve it?

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.133
Don't be ignorant

21
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.200
Li An, he is not worthy of our snow celery.

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.833
How could I possibly marry him?

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.366
Speak up, I offended his in-laws

24
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.666
He doesn't deserve to hum

25
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.900
You like to press people with things, right?

26
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.000
Would you marry this kind of garbage?

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.300
A useless piece of junk

28
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.933
The trash that can't even make money for this meal in his life

29
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.666
No, he doesn't deserve it at all

30
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:13.600
I would like it or not

31
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.766
Hear that? Trash

32
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.366
You don't deserve it.

33
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.233
You're just a cow

34
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.566
Unworthy to marry and have children

35
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.166
No one will marry you again who said no one

36
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.433
Who says he doesn't deserve it?
