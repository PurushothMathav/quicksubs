00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.633
Ahhh, wait, wait.

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.333
I would like to take you as my teacher

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.233
Demolish for you

4
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.966
Then you kneel and kowtow

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.900
Oh my god

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.233
Meet the master

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.366
Stupid, you're so damn ambitious

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.433
Hey, master, you won't lie to me, will you?

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.633
Really stupid

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.133
What are you?

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.566
Also worthy to be my apprentice

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.566
Dare to play with my lady, I will

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.200
Ah, I don't know

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:32.433
Now it's your turn.

15
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.500
It turns out that your confidence is the kung fu of this three-legged cat

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.400
So ignorant

17
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.600
My son is crazy

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.366
You are just a pawn on the plate

19
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.233
The qualification to gamble has to be nodded before you have it.

20
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.000
Really consider yourself an odd number

21
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.633
Are you crazy? This is the divine monkey of Great Xia

22
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.933
All subordinates are soldiers

23
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.000
It's all sky

24
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.533
Even if you use a miracle

25
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.000
Not his opponent

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.866
Thank you, that's enough, stop talking

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.166
Marquis Shen Wei, please forgive me.

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.900
He will never dare to do it again

29
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500
Sun Shao, it's your turn to talk too much

30
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.733
Fourth Young Master has nothing to do with my Li family

31
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.200
You can do whatever you want.

32
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.766
Yeah, yeah, whatever

33
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.066
You hear me, ant?

34
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.000
There's no rescue.

35
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.166
Kneel down and kowtow

36
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.700
Let me kneel

37
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.966
Even if your master comes today, he is not qualified

38
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:30.266
How dare you insult my master

39
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.333
Do you want to delay and wait for that Liu Kun?

40
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.866
Dream on.

41
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.066
He's just a town and dares to meddle in my business when he's familiar

42
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.166
Come

43
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.700
Break up 206 bones in his body and feed them to the dogs

44
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:51.666
Stop
