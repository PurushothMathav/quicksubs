00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.833
Why are you here, auntie?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.700
Why did you just come?

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.666
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.966
How come?

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.600
Brother, isn't this coming?

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.066
The three-day period has not yet arrived.

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.033
Are you in such a hurry to die?

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.833
How dare you touch me?

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.233
What are you?

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.200
What am I afraid of?

11
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.233
Run, why don't you run?

12
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.300
Ah, no.

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.400
Help me! Help me!

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.466
Lu Fei, you are bold

15
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.666
Don't relax your hands

16
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.666
I knew you didn't have the heart to treat your illness with this money

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.833
Let him go

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.700
Never try to cure your daughter's illness

19
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.733
You have insurance, you can cure it.

20
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.766
If you really love finding relatives, you should let him go

21
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.133
Let him be cured

22
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.733
Go away, do you want to harm your blood relatives for the rest of your life?

23
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.266
You bad guys

24
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.000
Don't bully brother

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.100
Brother, I am afraid that blood relatives will protect you.

26
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:14.933
tray

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.166
Didn't you say I'm looking for death?

28
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.433
Come on, do it!

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.366
Useless nonsense

30
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.300
You kneel down now

31
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.300
Lao Tzu kowtow

32
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.400
Otherwise, I want to save your woman

33
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.266
It looks like you are a lost love

34
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.366
But I don't need to be alone

35
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.033
So go die
