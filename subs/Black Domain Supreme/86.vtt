1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.800
Drink and leave before you start

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.100
Wow. Wow.

3
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.600
OK

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.900
OK

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.566
Ha ha.

6
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.866
This old thing is through in less than a bottle

7
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.266
Old trash

8
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.766
The little waste family is waste

9
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.500
Shut up!

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200
The wedding is not over yet

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.800
I won't give face to my mother's family

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.300
If this Xueqing marries, she can still have a good life

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.166
Grandma scrapped

14
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.233
They were there to protect me

15
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:48.100
Don't worry, Xueqing won't be wronged if she marries

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.666
I can still drink

17
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:54.966
Ah!

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.366
Ah, are you alright?

19
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.500
Ah it's alright old thing

20
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.866
Okay, I don't want to pick up the bride

21
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.166
Must drink I tell you

22
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.766
You drink the same

23
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.533
How amazing you are

24
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.433
But

25
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.633
If you have something to do

26
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.833
Obediently cancel this marriage

27
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.200
So that's your purpose

28
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
Stop talking nonsense and dare to gamble

29
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.000
Why wouldn't I dare? If I win, it's up to you

30
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.400
If you win

31
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.700
I kneel down and kowtow to you three times

32
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.133
Enough for me to win

33
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.900
All your family property is given to Xueqing as a dowry

34
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.533
Aren't you afraid of you?

35
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.366
But

36
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.700
Drink four bottles first

37
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.666
You are stupid, you never drink alcohol since you were a child.

38
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.600
Drink me stupid

39
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.666
Don't ask, what if you get alcoholism?

40
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.800
Don't worry.

41
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.700
He is no match for me either.

42
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.500
I drink like a drinker
