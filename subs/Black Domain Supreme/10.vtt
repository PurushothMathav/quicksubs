00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.600
How is that possible?

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.300
My son has been practicing martial arts for many years

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.133
So he actually gave birth

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.100
How could it be defeated in one go?

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.566
You just stepped on my dad with this leg

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.900
Then don't ask for it.

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.400
Ah boy

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.966
Give me more madness

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.633
Just kill your mother and kneel down

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.166
Let's go, Xiaoyun

11
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.866
Leave my mom alone

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.066
Don't be afraid, it will be fine soon.

13
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:32.833
Kneel down and don't let go of your sleeves

14
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.766
I'll kill you first, old man

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
kid

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.633
Can you fight?

17
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.633
Participate in the less braised swordsman

18
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.966
I see how you fight

19
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.700
You can run

20
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.100
But these two old things are set

21
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.966
Die for me.

22
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.800
Are you looking for me?

23
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.666
I'll kill your whole family first

24
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.300
Then kill your sister

25
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.066
How can a dead person be so powerful?

26
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.033
Don't kill me!

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.300
Are we related?

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.666
I'm your cousin

29
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.400
Second uncle, hurry up and save my second uncle

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.900
You saved me when I was almost gloomy

31
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.300
You know me too

32
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.700
You also know that my father saved you in the first place

33
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.566
General privilege

34
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:42.033
You don't deserve to be proud too soon

35
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.266
I won't let you go.

36
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.800
Wrong good

37
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.766
Lu Xueqing's fool

38
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.766
Did we solve it for me?
