00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.100
Mr. Chen and his family saved my life

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.866
I'll protect him no matter what.

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:08.266
You, are you really for this trash?

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.166
Do it right for my price?

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.700
Mr. Sun makes a price

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.166
I would like to eliminate disasters

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.400
Fall this man

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
Does my Sun family owe you that money?

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.900
Don't kill this person today

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.833
How will my Sun family mix in Jiangcheng in the future?

11
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.133
Mr. Chen

12
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.166
Sorry for the trouble, it's not easy to do.

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.900
You two are gone now.

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.366
Things here are where I come from

15
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.400
The Sun family still doesn't care about it

16
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.300
I won't leave if my brother doesn't leave

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.666
Don't worry, outsiders are no match for my brother.

18
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.766
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.066
You are a countryman

20
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.200
Dare to fight with the Sun family

21
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.300
Don't implicate me

22
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.233
My daughter's words are what I mean

23
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.933
That kid, I'm sure today

24
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.033
Haha Baoding

25
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.800
What guarantee do you get?

26
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.066
This is 1 million

27
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.200
Who wasted this garbage?

28
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.766
Whose 1 million is this?

29
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.166
People want to tear their faces

30
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:22.066
Haha, go to your house and tell me to tear your face

31
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:26.100
My fortune has climbed to the big man

32
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.800
I can't save him when I come out today

33
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.266
What a big breath

34
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.333
I see how you move

35
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.433
Boy, I told you to keep your mouth shut forever

36
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.500
Mr. Sun really can't give face

37
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.200
Give you shit face

38
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.000
They all scrapped this garbage for me

39
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Who dares to stop

40
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.366
Kill one piece

41
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.266
Stop

42
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.100
The frog at the bottom of the well does not know the real dragon

43
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.700
Dare to touch Mr. Deer

44
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.600
Do you know who he is?
