00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.100
Jing'er, you are so happy to meet Master Zhao

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.800
Hey, look at this villa

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.133
How luxurious

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.600
What a view!

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.566
If only I could live here

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.600
Even if it saves me ten years of life, I am also willing to

7
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.033
It's all Tianhua

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.966
Hey, what's this?

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.100
This Longhu villa is more expensive the more you see it at night

10
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.166
The most expensive thing is to wait on the roof

11
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.500
I don't know which big boss bought it.

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.966
Hey, is that Xu Feng?

13
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.266
How did this guy get in?

14
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.933
Are those security guards trash?

15
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:41.366
Could he be the individual owner?

16
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.400
That's not possible.

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500
It is absolutely impossible for Xu Feng, a poor man, to buy a house here

18
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.466
I know his bottom line best.

19
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.966
Could it be a gift from the Su family?

20
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.966
I remember he saved you, Su Clan Leader ordered

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.666
Possibly hum

22
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.466
I don't know what kind of shit luck that guy got

23
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.366
He actually saved that Mr. Chen's order

24
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.100
Or at the Calvin Hotel

25
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.066
Xu Kun must die

26
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.033
Go and have a look. Go.
