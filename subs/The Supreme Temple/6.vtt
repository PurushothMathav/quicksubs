00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.566
You and Dad have lived in a place like this all these years

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.966
Mom is not capable

12
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.866
There is really no money at home

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:35.200
Otherwise, we haven't seen you for the past three years

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.533
Mom is my dad

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.000
I implicated you

16
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.966
You lost weight mom

17
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.700
You are resting at home

18
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.700

19
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.266

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.066
Dad, come back

21
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.166
You can't beat them

22
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.833
Behind them is the Temple of God

23
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.400
The ten legions of the Temple of God are also surrounded here

24
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.433
Please order the hall master

25
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.666
No one comes out for five minutes

26
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.566
You go in

27
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.366

28
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.100

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.633
Cut the crap

34
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.400
What about what I want?

35
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700
Hey, it's already ready

36
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.066
It's in the freezer.

37
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.600
Keep it carefully

38
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.033

Ah!

42
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.000
Master, Mr. Wang

43
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.600
Someone spat

44
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.100
What are you yelling about?

45
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Can't you see I'm entertaining guests?

46
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:51.333
step back

47
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.033
Who ate bear heart and leopard gall?

48
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.166
People who dare to touch our Dragon Tiger Gang

49
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.833
He's just courting death

50
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.833
It's you who are courting death
