00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.766
Mom, wait here for a while

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.133
You'll find out later

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.600
Oh, old man, look how grand this is

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.466
Since my eyes were healed

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:14.000
I can see clearly

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.000
Mom and Dad, I told you

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.000
I'll let you see it with your own eyes

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.766
All the good things in this world

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.466
Mr. Xu is ready

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.266
Uncle aunt

11
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.100
Ouch Qinger

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.000
You're here too

13
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:34.800
What about Xu Feng?

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.266
Why did he leave you two here?

15
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.766
He has something to do

16
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.733
Went out with his friends

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.033
Then I'll stay here with you

18
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.666
Auntie since your eyes were cured

19
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.400
Fleshy body

20
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.500
That's great.

21
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.833
Hahaha, you really can talk.

22
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.900
People are kind and beautiful

23
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.966
It never occurred to me.

24
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.566
Our family has such a good girlfriend as you

25
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.866
Hahaha yes

26
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.233
When are you two getting married?

27
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.833
Oh, dear.

28
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.166
He hasn't proposed to me yet.

29
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.800
I'm still waiting for someone

30
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.600
Qing'er, don't worry.

31
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.733
Wait for the wind to come back

32
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.900
I'll let him do it right away

33
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.566
We won't treat you badly.

34
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.966
Yes, I won't treat you badly.

35
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.266
How did they get here?
