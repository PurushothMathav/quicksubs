00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:04.900
This rapacious dog actually sat in the first row with Old Shen

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.733
It must have been brought there by the Hokkien

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.466
Hey, I don't understand.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.966
Such an unfortunate thing

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.533
Dare to bring it in front of such a big man

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.866
There's no shame in that.

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.200
So shameless

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.600
The wimp who relies on that person to climb high branches?

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.200
The card is not over

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.766
Go over and expose Xu Feng's little hand as soon as possible

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.100
You're dead, you son of a bitch

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.200
Take a look.

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.166
This Ocean Star necklace

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.900
Masterpieces in the International Masters

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
Starlight

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.266
Perfect starting price

17
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:40.533
30 million I don't know which lady was there

18
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.266
Worth this necklace

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:44.766
Qinger

20
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.866
Do you like it?

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.566
I think this necklace is average. I've seen it before.

22
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.333
But if you buy it for me

23
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.500
I can think about it.

24
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.233
35 million

25
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.400
I'm just kidding.

26
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.800
How can you be serious?

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.233
Yeah.

28
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.033
I'll buy you whatever you like.

29
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.100
40 million
