00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.400
Li Junjie

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.766
Aren't you very proud of the Matcha Group?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.733
Why are you acting like a lost dog now?

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.100
Also call for an invitation

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.200
Aha you were fucking attacked

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.533
We have the ability

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.200
You just have a fair fight with Lao Tzu

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.300
I asked Shen Yi to come over

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.666
Farewell to you, you resist in front of me

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.866
You Western dogs

11
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.900
You are just afraid of losing your job

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.166
That's why you came here to attack

13
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.066
The taste of being defeated by one move

14
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.900
Let it go hahaha

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.533
No one can stop us this time

16
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.366
You can't do it, neither can anyone use that low-level pariah

17
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.366
All of you

18
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.300
The end result will only be surrendered at our feet

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.766
Go to hell.

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.966
Want me to submit

21
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.500
Pull your mother over to persuade Lao Tzu

22
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.766
Ask him to hand over the True Heaven Group

23
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.466
Thirteen generations of Mr. Li Zhentian

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.300
It was you who took the initiative to hand over Zhentian Group

25
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.666
Or let me plant you

26
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.200
As long as you hand it over obediently

27
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.566
I'll give you a chance.

28
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.033
Let you be a dog in my name

29
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.833
Hahahahaha

30
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.766
It seems that the lesson taught you last time was not bad

31
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.000
How dare you speak nonsense
