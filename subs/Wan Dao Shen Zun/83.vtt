00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.866
Sir, wait a minute.

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.333
I'll arrange the Panpan meeting first. Okay?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.266
You go first

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.233
I'll wait here.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.900
Shen Rong

6
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.533
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.800
Do you know

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.666
Today I will bring

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.733
Technology and their families come to this auction

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.433
So you sneak in

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.433
I want to go in with my power

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.400
Hmph, I don't have the ability, and I still want to gather the power of others

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.066
I suggest you better recognize that you are a waste

14
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.733
Live this life honestly

15
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.100
This brings together all the celebrities

16
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.266
It's not a place you can stay.

17
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.266
Get out now

18
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.500
I have other ideas

19
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
I don't need anyone to point fingers at me yet

20
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.900
I still need to rub your power here

21
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.966
No need to rub against my power

22
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.733
Then how did you get in?

23
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.000
Oh, I see.

24
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.800
You must have snuck in

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.400
Do you want to steal something?

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.666
steal

27
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.900
Is there anything here worth stealing?

28
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.433
Look at your poverty

29
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.266
Everything here is worth millions.

30
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.533
Even tens of millions

31
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.433
It's an existence you've never seen in your life

32
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.600
Go out later

33
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.866
Don't say you know me

34
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.800
Our Ji family can't afford to lose this person.

35
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.933
You are so undisciplined

36
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.866
I'm willing to degenerate to this point

37
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:13.933
You and the reason for this

38
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.166
Because you Qingchi stopped me from disciplining him

39
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.733
At least not like this

40
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.400
I'll send him in now

41
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.300
To avoid bigger disasters in the future

42
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.700
My cousin did nothing wrong, why did you kill him?

43
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.666
Hey, hey, brother.

44
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:29.566
If you dare to come in and steal something today, you will dare to rob it tomorrow.

45
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm not talking about technology.

46
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.366
Although it's all for your own good

47
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.833
People just say a few words to you and you talk back

48
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.600
So be it.

49
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.966
My brother and uncle discipline you well

50
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.666
Lock you up for two years

51
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.200
A dog like you can't stop eating shit

52
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.100
Don't give up your seat

53
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.866
Never repent

54
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.633
It's cheap to discipline me.
