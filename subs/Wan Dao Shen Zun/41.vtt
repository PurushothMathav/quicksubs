00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Are you out of your mind or your eyes don't grow?

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.033
Dad is serious about what happened at the wine table

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.700
I got a handle. If you want to die, don't worry about it.

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.166
Fourth Master, this day, the master is all I used to want face

5
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.166
That's why people on the road call me that

6
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.300
How dare I say God in front of you

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.566
You are the sky below

8
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.566
Lower middle spine

9
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.966
Middle and Lower Supreme

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.333
The pride of the middleman

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.233
middle and lower

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.833
Didn't you just help them suppress the subordinates?

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.500
Hey, no, no.

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.800
Master Shen, even if you don't come

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.633
I don't dare to suppress the subordinates either

16
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.300
It's this Broly

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.500
With the resources of Baokuni

18
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.400
Want to curry favor with our Zhentian Group

19
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400
So I just

20
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.366
I only

21
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.833
Didn't you just make me kneel?

22
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.133
Sorry for hitting myself hahaha

23
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.400
I hope that my heart has eyes in autumn and does not hesitate to Tarzan

24
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.266
Just fine

25
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.300
Treat me as a wholesale

26
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.900
brother

27
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:58.866
Hahaha

28
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:02.266
Didn't you just ask my friend to take off his clothes?

29
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.533
Do you bark like a dog?

30
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.166
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

31
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.466
Little Tang, my heart is my own head, haha.
