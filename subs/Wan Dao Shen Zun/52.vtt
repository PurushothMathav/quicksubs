1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.733
How is the leader?

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.400
Decide who to send to fight

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.666
I can't help you with this rubbish alone

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.766
Why don't you take the initiative to admit defeat now?

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.900
I just want you to hand over

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.500
The underground management rights of Zhentian Group and Zhongxia General

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.400
That's it, I have wolf ambitions

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
I hand over the management to them

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.533
Let the economy and development of the lower middle

10
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.100
Will be poisoned by their throats

11
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.400
If you don't fight

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.866
They will surely die for righteousness and do whatever they want

13
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.333
At that time

14
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.266
I always want to be in front of the world, but I can't hold my head up

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.166
I serve you shamelessly

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.566
You advised me to be seriously injured before you dared to be presumptuous

17
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.600
Mr. Li, that's not what I said

18
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.700
There is a saying among you that is well said

19
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.733
The bigger the wind and waves, the more rain belongs to you

20
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.100
If you don't accept it, just come up and fight

21
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.000
I lost the friction group and chose you

22
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:47.966
And I publicly apologize and admit that the West has no doubt

23
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.100
Better than loyalty and filial piety

24
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.966
Shameless's deliberate convener announced to the world

25
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.066
Force us to do it

26
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.400
Of course, if you lose

27
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.766
I want to group all day

28
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.266
Then call the entire ideal of loyalty and filial piety

29
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.566
This dirty towel has a big appetite.

30
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.900
Not afraid of dying

31
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.066
Brother has documents and responsibilities

32
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.466
We'll definitely get it.

33
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.666
Lower and middle underground management rights

34
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.166
I can't call out

35
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.700
Ralph, stop being delusional

36
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.666
I can't possibly agree to your condition.

37
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.633
Good idea.

38
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.300
Bet on it
