1
00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.666
Just me

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.766
Just because I am the son of a neutral group executive

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.566
You can also get in touch with the biggest characters in the middle and lower

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.166
To discipline you a thief

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.200
Not good enough?

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.000
Not enough trash to be so arrogant

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.566
What about my middle and lower third square consortium?

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.533
Come to our middle and lower fourth sand medicine group

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.800
Is it enough now bro?

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.000
You are a top-level trash

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.233
Dare to challenge the top level of the middle and lower

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.966
Okay, since you are courting death, then I will fulfill you

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.600
Shoot this thief out for me

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.600
Who says saving money and trouble sneaks money in to steal things?

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.333
As far as you say, save money and steal

16
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.133
Oh yes

17
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.266
It's him. There are only 50 places for this card to be sold out.

18
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.400
What qualifications do you have to come in with this trash?

19
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.700
Just came in for the money

20
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.966
If Mr. Shen is not qualified

21
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.933
No one in the middle and lower levels is eligible

22
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.966
What are you?

23
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.100
Dare to question

24
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:01.666
Mr. Shen

25
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.600
My grandfather personally invited me to have long eyes

26
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.366
Do you say you are eligible to participate in the auction?

27
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.900
Or is your Xu family better than my Qin family emperor?

28
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.166
Not that Miss Qin

29
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.133
You misunderstood.

30
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.400
I didn't mean it that way.

31
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:15.866
Mr. Shen

32
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.466
My grandfather is waiting for you inside. Let's go

33
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.000
Cousin, I'll go first

34
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.666
Mr. Shen, do you want me to teach him a lesson?

35
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.766
Just ignore it.

36
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.566
Isn't it just a waste of work?

37
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.833
If it weren't for reliable

38
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:35.500
What qualifications does he have to come in?

39
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.900
One day they get tired of playing

40
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.766
He'll be beaten back to his original state

41
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.866
If you are not promising, the man will eat soft rice

42
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.300
It looks disgusting.

43
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.566
Wait until he's used up

44
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.333
When you come back with nothing

45
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.900
You know how wrong it is

46
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.266
A bunch of clumsy people

47
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:54.400
More dim-eyed than an old man like me

48
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.000
Kid Xu Ming has seen Grandpa Guan

49
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.966
I didn't expect to see you here again

50
00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.500
My dad always reminds you

51
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.700
He said that the person he admires the most is you

52
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.700
Finally met the deity
