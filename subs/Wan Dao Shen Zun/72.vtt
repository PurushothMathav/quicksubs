00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.066
Are you pretending to be addicted?

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.333
Xiaolong, why don't you apologize?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.333
Tell everyone that it was just a joke.

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.300
Therefore, I did not lie.

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.300
The natural truth will not be revealed tomorrow

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.533
That being the case

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.100
Tomorrow I will know

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.566
Jumping beam clowns are ultimately difficult to achieve elegance

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.233
Uncle Jay, I'm leaving first

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.966
This has obviously given you a chance to apologize

11
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.466
I'm just rushing to lose face here

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.300
Xiao Rong

13
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.333
Don't think too much

14
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.466
I'm going to give you time to talk about it.

15
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.633
No, just meet tomorrow.

16
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.866
I'm going back first

17
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.866
It's all this time

18
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.933
Use that crap

19
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.533
Do you know you're exposed?

20
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.700
So I dare not come

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.000
Just because he wants to help me arrange it in the middle ringgit

22
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He didn't dare

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's normal for him not to come.

24
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.500
Okay, Ruxin has to go to work in a while

25
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.366
Don't wait for him, he doesn't dare to come, what else do you say?

26
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.066
Tell him to be honest in the future and don't talk big

27
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.466
I feel sick when I see him now

28
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.200
Let's go in then!

29
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.700
aunt

30
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.766
Come so early

31
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.100
Shen Rong, you came here on purpose today

32
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.200
For you to pretend to be my credit

33
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.466
This stupid thing to apologize for

34
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:28.966
I didn't say it.

35
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.200
You are so thick-skinned

36
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.733
You can't do that.

37
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.533
Xiao Rong

38
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.566
You apologize to Mr. Xu, what's the matter?

39
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:36.600
I'm not wrong

40
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.666
Why apologize?

41
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:38.766
Shen Rong

42
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.700
I know you hate me for being better than you everywhere

43
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.666
But you can't be so shameless.

44
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.166
Take my credit

45
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.100
Or are you really going to take us into neutral?

46
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.900
immediately

47
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.066
Is it hard to get in?
