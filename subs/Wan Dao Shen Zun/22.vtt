00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.966
All relationships that can be delayed are delayed

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.366
See a doctor

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.000
Come out, that kid actually came out

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.900
Cousin, Xiao Rong

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.900
Are you all right?

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.633
The Qin family didn't embarrass you, did they?

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.100
The Qin family respects me quite a bit

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.366
It's okay, what's quiet?

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.800
You are a big boy

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.200
If it weren't for me this time, you would have died at your in-laws' house

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.400
Still talking about it

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.700
Do you know who you are provoking?

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.400
How terrifying is the power of the in-laws?

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.966
Don't you have a point in mind?

15
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.966
Hmph, still talking nonsense here

16
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.366
The little uncle has such a temper

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.866
Don't take it personally.

18
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.333
It doesn't matter if Aunt Shen Long's family is for you

19
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.500
Didn't rest all night

20
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.866
You should be a little more measured in what you do in the future, right?

21
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.066
Thank you, Aunt Miao, what are you talking about?

22
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:45.866
Humph

23
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.800
You should thank President Qian for his willingness to help

24
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.500
Xie Qin's family is magnanimous

25
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.766
I should thank you even more for taking the trouble to find someone to help

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.166
Boy, you have no father or mother

27
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.466
I am your elder

28
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.333
I teach you a lesson, you should listen

29
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.500
In the future, give me a down-to-earth and good life

30
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.133
Don't hurt

31
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.366
The bad habits of the mouth are brought to the city

32
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.566
The iron slab is a trifle

33
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.700
No thought of the consequences

34
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.600
Too reckless, I'm looking at my cousin's sake

35
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.533
I won't care about what you just said

36
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.966
But that doesn't mean it's because

37
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.566
Relatives you just left

38
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.866
Don't take yourself too seriously
