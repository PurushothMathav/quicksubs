00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.866
Come do one

2
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.666
It's time to arrive at the store, it's coming soon.

3
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.033
Hi, here we come.

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.266
Ruxian, why are you so late?

5
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.866
Ouch, forget it.

6
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.266
A guy named Shen Rong came to our house

7
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.200
I don't know where my mom saw through

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
Don't say you're with me and him

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.600
Oh, not bad.

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.066
I have met the parents. How are the family conditions?

11
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.866
How about our real name?

12
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.766
Big glutinous rice

13
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:35.933
My family Xu

14
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.466
The young father is an executive of the neutral group

15
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.600
What was that?

16
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.666
No money, no power

17
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.966
There's no place in the middle or the bottom.

18
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.266
How can you live in our house now?

19
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.733
How can I compare with your group of merchants?

20
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.966
How can that work?

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.333
People like him are not in the same world as us at all

22
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.700
Is that so?

23
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.166
The kid will come in a while

24
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.133
I'll take care of him for you

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.100
Let him know.

26
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.166
Not everyone can follow our season

27
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.633
A beautiful woman

28
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.600
Wait a minute, you must teach him a good lesson for me

29
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.366
Let him retreat

30
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.200
Here. Cheers. Cheers.

31
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.100
Me, just him

32
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.100
Lucy, it's not safe here

33
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.933
I can't protect you for a while

34
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.666
Why don't you come back with me first?

35
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.600
What do you mean?

36
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.166
When you first arrive, you must take Ruxin with you.

37
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.133
He really thinks of himself as his new fiancÃ©

38
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.900
You don't see what virtue you have

39
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.266
Do you deserve it? I'm sorry, hurry up and get out of here.

40
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.666
This place is not for you

41
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.666
Why don't you go home first?

42
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.666
Then I'll go to the bathroom first

43
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:54.400
start

44
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:57.466
Stop

45
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.966
Why are you going?

46
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.700
You have to rely on your heart

47
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.933
You are so thick-skinned

48
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.766
To look but not to look

49
00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.200
Can't be patient

50
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.633
Who gave you the courage to pursue someone without losing heart?
