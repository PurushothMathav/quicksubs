00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.766
You want to go too

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.166
How is that possible?

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.766
You are fucking dead

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.566
The master is a midsummer god

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.900
The Temple of War has met the God who gave me three points.

6
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.766
Boy, our wife is absolutely amazing

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.266
You must die, right?

8
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.366
Boy, God is the middle and lower body

9
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.333
The powerhouse of the dragon protection lineage

10
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.466
The entire middle and lower boss is his younger brother

11
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.466
He stomps his feet

12
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.366
Earthquakes in both the middle and the bottom

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.566
Wait a minute

14
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.900
I see you don't even dare to put a skin

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.466
What happened to Xiaobu

16
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.333
Sir, I was beaten downstairs

17
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.933
I gave your name

18
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.900
The person who was beaten was miserable

19
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:03.000
That's a rarity. Follow me over there and crush him

20
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.600
Hahahahaha boy, you are very good at fighting.

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.266
You can hit 100

22
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.000
1,000 you shoot me a gun

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.600
Can you shoot?

24
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.966
Boy, run away

25
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.366
While there's still a chance

26
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.900
Yes, I'm not afraid of running out of firewood if I keep the green mountains

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.866
Just one person.

28
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.900
How do you fight against all the forces in the middle and lower levels?

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.000
Chen Rong, this happened because of us

30
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.066
You'd better go

31
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.300
I'll push you what to push you, little bird

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.966
What are you?
