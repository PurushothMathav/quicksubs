00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.100
Mr. Shen

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.666
Are you all right?

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.866
It's okay, I'll go to the basement

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.266
You talk first

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.733
What the hell happened oops

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.800
Master, you don't know what just happened here

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.633
Ah no

8
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.566
Mr. Shen said not to expose his identity

9
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.700
I can't say

10
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.800
What about Rover? Isn't he looking for trouble?

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Already doomed

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.400
Oops master

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.366
Don't ask

14
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.233
I really can't tell you.

15
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.600
What the hell is going on?

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.033
I lifted the seal here

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600
The same thing for acne

18
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.300
I can't tell you the rest.

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.566
Know too much

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.000
Not good for you

21
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.633
Now the God Kill has been obtained.

22
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.000
Just the last

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200
Flying Dragon Rui can be practiced very difficult

24
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.233
I see.

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.666
Mr. Shen, my grandfather asked me to come this time.

26
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.700
There is one more thing I want to ask you for help with.

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.433
You said there will be an auction tomorrow

28
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.200
Grandpa wants to purchase a batch of medicinal materials for the Temple of War

29
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.966
I know this little thing shouldn't bother you

30
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.666
But the finale of the auction

31
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.200
But insist on the medicinal materials you want

32
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200
Flying Dragon Rui

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.800
Really?

34
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:23.633
I'll go.
