00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.900
Xiao Gu

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.300
You are looking for me, Xiao Rong, sit down

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.766
I haven't embarrassed you during this time, have I?

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.833
Nothing happened.

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.233
Why are my cousin and uncle so ugly?

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.366
Nothing, the main thing is to worry about your safety.

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.800
You have the nerve to ask

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.600
If you hadn't offended Risshoda

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.500
I can do it now

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.266
Can't find a suitable good job?

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.100
Do you know how powerful Rizhiten is?

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.900
No one in the middle and lower classes dared to provoke

13
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.133
Who dares to ask for Ruxin?

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.300
Ruxin is still young

15
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.766
Can I find a job slowly?

16
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.800
This Xiao Rong is also worried that something will happen to Nu Skin

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.400
So you did the wrong thing.

18
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.966
Xiaorong Xiaorong knows him every day

19
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.100
When will he pass by our house when he comes?

20
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.066
Do I have to destroy my daughter on him?

21
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.033
You are willing

22
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.133
Husband, don't be angry.

23
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.800
Maybe Xiaorong really has a way

24
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.366
Xiao Guo, don't worry.

25
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.200
I can ask my cousin to go to work at Zhentian Group

26
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.800
What nonsense

27
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.333
You have offended Lizhentian

28
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.200
I didn't ask you to invite you

29
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.566
How dare you say

30
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.800
Can you arrange me to work at Zhentian Group?

31
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800
I see your ability to talk big

32
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.000
I can't change it in my life

33
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.433
You are hopeless
