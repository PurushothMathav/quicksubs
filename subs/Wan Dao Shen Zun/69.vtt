00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.400
You are hopeless

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.466
Liar

3
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.300
Open your mouth

4
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.400
Even if I tried my best

5
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.366
There's no way to let go of the force

6
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.166
After you

7
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.666
Go out and don't say it has anything to do with us

8
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.966
I can't afford to lose this person.

9
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.033
Husband, don't be angry.

10
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.500
Maybe Xiaolong really has a way

11
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800
Mom, what can he do?

12
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
Even if he goes to kowtow to Striving Tian and apologize now

13
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.100
People may not be able to forgive him

14
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.166
Don't talk about Xiaorong, they are also anxious.

15
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.466
The tone is a little harsh

16
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.533
Don't worry about it.

17
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.866
Cousin, I'm fine.

18
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.466
Everything I did for the Ji family

19
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.866
It's all to repay my cousin

20
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.733
And I'm not lying.

21
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.933
Even if my cousin wants to go to work in a neutral group

22
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.700
It's just a word from me

23
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.600
Shen Rong, you have a bottom line for talking nonsense

24
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600
Now I dare to say anything

25
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.366
The neutral group is a consortium under Guan Jucai

26
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.266
Even the Temple of War can't afford to provoke

27
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.433
Bah listen to you

28
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.566
Don't worry, let me expose him.

29
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.366
you

30
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.466
I just sent a resume to Neutral Group

31
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.766
What if you had the ability?

32
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.766
You put me in the neutral group now

33
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.966
If you can't do it

34
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:07.833
Please don't come to our house in the future. It's annoying.

35
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.033
Xiaolong, do you want to forget it?

36
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.866
Don't worry, little things

37
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.333
Guan Lao, I need your help with a small matter.

38
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.800
My cousin wants to go to your company

39
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.400
You arrange it

40
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.033
Mr. Shen said that his wife would arrange it immediately

41
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.666
It's arranged.
