00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.866
If I don't go up, will someone help you up?

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.066
I said you can't

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.566
It's you who don't listen and have to go up

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.400
Hey, Mr. Shen

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.000
It's all up to you

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.466
The promised pay will be doubled when it is done

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.033
No, nothing else.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.766
Mr. Li, please think again.

9
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.933
Brother, just like him

10
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.400
How can it represent our home?

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.500
That's ridiculous.

12
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.200
You are brave, little boy

13
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.833
Is there really no one in the middle and lower levels?

14
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.066
I need you to come forward

15
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.466
Not even a complete demon

16
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.500
Your bloodline is among us

17
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.966
We all call it

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.566
Bastard, so you deserve to break in front of me

19
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.866
How could this kid know my identity as a police officer?

20
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.700
Does he really know how to thank you?

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.633
What the hell did you say?

22
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.666
Nothing.

23
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.300
Come quickly

24
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.566
I'll take the herbs back after the fight

25
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.566
Brother, look at why he is just afraid

26
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.700
Even more breath

27
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.266
Should I be direct later?

28
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.400
Give up if you don't fight, shut up

29
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.133
Mr. Shen has his own way

30
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.233
Look at this
