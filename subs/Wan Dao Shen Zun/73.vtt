00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.933
A shameful thing for the church in public

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.500
Apologize to Mr. Xu immediately

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.633
Do you need to clean up?

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.000
I stop

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.100
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.933
Oops President Qian

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.800
I didn't expect to meet you here

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.866
Thank you for your help last time.

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.166
Hahaha, help!

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.266
What help?

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:20.666
Oh, dear.

12
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.466
Just last time you forgot I had a relative who didn't live up to expectations

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.500
Offended the in-laws

14
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.600
He was arrested by his in-laws.

15
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.300
I'll call you for help before I get back safely

16
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.633
Hurry up and apologize to President Qian

17
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.800
Hahaha fart?

18
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.966
I'm free

19
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.666
Offend the Qin family for your broken relative

20
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.000
Am I not a fucking fool?

21
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.800
I'm talking nonsense

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.666
Could it be that Shen Long came back by himself last time?

23
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.033
It has nothing to do with me.

24
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.633
Impossible, he is not qualified at all

25
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.133
Hey, my work time is coming soon.

26
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.066
Stop the ink, please.

27
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.866
Isn't the neutral group inside?

28
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.000
Who did it?

29
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.366
Let's go in and try it and we'll know

30
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.300
Okay, come with me and I'll take you in

31
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.766
Oops, but this place is heavily guarded

32
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.833
disheveled

33
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.100
Can't get in

34
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.266
Are you staying here?

35
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.966
I am destined to be the bright moon in the sky

36
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.700
And you are the dust on the ground

37
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.700
You and I are doomed

38
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.866
We are not the same kind of people
