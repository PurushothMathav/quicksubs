1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.966
Thank you, Mr. Shen, for your help

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.000
Otherwise, middle and lower

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.300
Why are you really going to be burned by the sunset devil?

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.500
It's okay to raise your hand

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
Come here.

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.600
Hurry up!

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.866
Apologize to Mr. Shen

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.966
The value is that you don't trust Mr. Shen

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.233
Mr. Shen, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.700
Speak without eyeballs

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.700
Now that things are settled

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.766
Help me find Du Yuanhua

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.566
Yes

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:27.533
But

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.933
Du Yuanhua is in the hands of Guan Jucai of the neutral group

16
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.066
This Guan Ju is weird by nature

17
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.700
He was bedridden all year round.

18
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.466
As long as Mr. Shen is willing to take action to cure his illness

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.866
I believe this can all be solved

20
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:44.166
It's okay to see someone else. I'll find a way. Who?

21
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.966
Take it hey no no no

22
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:47.700
Mr. Shen

23
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.466
This is the contract you got alone

24
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.233
What right do I have to get him?

25
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.633
Just help me find Du Yuanhua

26
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.066
Then thank God

27
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.400
And after I left

28
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.333
Take care of my family for me

29
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.133
Yes

30
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.933
Mr. Shen, the neutral group where Jucai belongs

31
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.566
Holding the economic lifeline of the country

32
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.666
Even the Temple of War looked up to him from many places

33
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.766
I didn't even bother to take time off.

34
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.800
Uh, when I went to you

35
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.833
Try not to offend him.

36
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.366
Hey
