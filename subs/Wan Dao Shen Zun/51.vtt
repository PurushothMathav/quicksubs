00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.200
Mr. Shen

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.000
I have arranged for Li Xiaoqing to be safe

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Send me back

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.600
Wait a minute, our showdown with the Scrub Group is here

5
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.933
Ah!

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.366
Brother, how did you find him?

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.666
Nature is poor

8
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.066
Mr. Shen can't help me

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.266
Brother, look who this is

10
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.300
This is Mr. Zheng, the heir to the captured God of War

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.100
Yes, he is.

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.200
I can't ask some stinky fish and rotten shrimp to recharge at all

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.600
Humph

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.200
Da Shang loved Shang Yi and had to accept Mr. Shen

15
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.066
Noble person of the Li family

16
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.866
It is the honor of our Li family to have Mr. Shen take action

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.900
Just because he has some medical skills

18
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.666
I feel like I can get involved in anything

19
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.566
Do you really think you can handle this?

20
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.366
Mr. Shen's kung fu is first-class

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.466
Even I am in the hands of Mr. Shen

22
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.866
Can't make a move

23
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.566
Your strength

24
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.933
I can crush you 100 times with three hands

25
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.400
If you win, you are an expert

26
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.433
Who stipulated

27
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.900
Hey brother

28
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.366
This gentleman is the heir to the God of War

29
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.766
You can definitely win with him

30
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:13.500
It's much better than finding someone a stinky fish and rotten shrimp

31
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.366
How do you know?

32
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.600
He is better than me

33
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.166
Boy, don't provoke me

34
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.333
I don't eat your set either

35
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.700
You are from wild deer

36
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.166
I am the heir to the god of war

37
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.933
Can you compare? Can you compare?

38
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.100
Don't think you won something bad

39
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.133
I feel like I can be defiant

40
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.433
Nothing in front of me

41
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.266
Mr. Li, no one can beat me

42
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.100
Is there anyone here who can follow me?
