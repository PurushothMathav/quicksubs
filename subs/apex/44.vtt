00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.766
Ok you foaming

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.333
You have been by the side of the Supreme Emperor since you were a child

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.433
The emperor is so kind to you

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.000
Why would you do that?

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.066
Who ate the rest of your ignorance?

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.233
Ask the emperor to grant the old slave a death

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.666
That being the case

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.200
This is for you

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.833
Emperor Emperor

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.933
Xi silently followed the Supreme Emperor for decades

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.333
In the past, he also helped the emperor

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.800
Several princes were brought up by him

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800
The emperor is still seriously ill

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.900
If death

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.566
I'm afraid the Supreme Emperor will be sad when he wakes up

16
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.366
Emperor

17
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:34.966
So be it.

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.833
Put Mammy Xi in jail first

19
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.033
Wait until the Supreme Emperor recovers before making a decision

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:42.666
Raincoat

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.466
You stay and detoxify the Supreme Emperor

22
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.600
Everyone else leave

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.700
Wait a minute.

24
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.400
Xi Mengmeng

25
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.466
You poisoned the Supreme Emperor

26
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.466
To frame me

27
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.933
The princess thinks so

28
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.466
So be it.

29
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.600
On that day, you helped me to the top for my bad name

30
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.166
I had thought that

31
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.966
In this palace and outside the palace

32
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.500
Finally, someone is nice to me

33
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:13.866
It seems

34
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.833
I think too much

35
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.200
It was the old slave who disappointed the princess

36
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.100
The old slave made a big mistake that cannot be repaid

37
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.433
I dare not ask anyone for forgiveness

38
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.000
Only ask the princess to tell the prince

39
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.166
The Son of Heaven is heartless

40
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.566
Royal No Relatives

41
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.766
Under power

42
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.033
Blood relatives cannot be fully trusted

43
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.366
What's more

44
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.833
What did he mean by that?
