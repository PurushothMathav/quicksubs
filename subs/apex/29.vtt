00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.300
You're not talking about the men's place, are you?

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.600
Scrap you, how can you be so direct

3
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.566
Tang Yao

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.466
What nonsense are you talking about?

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.633
The summer vacation is still retired in advance

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.066
Hey you

7
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.900
The sun said

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.966
What else do you have? He's talking nonsense.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.733
To the doctor

10
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.200
How can you hide your illness?

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.466
In case your wound is not treated properly

12
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.700
Causes infection and high fever

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.733
That could kill you.

14
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.066
What's your business?

15
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.766
So

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.166
You're really hurt down there

17
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.866
How can this hurt the bottom?

18
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.166
Could it be that you were chopped up lying down?

19
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.200
I'm going to kill you

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.100
To kill, wait until you are well before killing

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.833
To please now

22
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.233
Let me see how serious your condition is

23
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.766
This king will not show you even if he dies.

24
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.400
What's there to be shy about?

25
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.400
I've seen a lot of patients like you

26
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.233
Have you seen others

27
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.066
I'm talking nonsense

28
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.233
Just let me take a look

29
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.400
If you don't cooperate with me again

30
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
I will enter the palace and ask the Supreme Emperor to grant a decree

31
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.000
Let him allow me to see

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.766
Do you still know how to write the word shame?

33
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.100
Trade my shame for your life

34
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.700
I don't know who earned it.

35
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.866
Just let me take a look

36
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.300
let go

37
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.166
Spread your legs. I can't see it.

38
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.100
Don't run your hands around

39
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.100
I took it away so I could see the wound better

40
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.100
You're hurt to the bone

41
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.500
If you delay any longer

42
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.666
You may really not want this thing.

43
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.533
Which woman has followed you since then?

44
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:55.733
Will dislike you

45
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.033
You dislike this king

46
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.833
I didn't say I wanted to be with you, you are Princess Chu

47
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.233
If you don't follow this king, who else do you want to follow?

48
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.566
What do you want to do again?
