00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.800
Invite us now.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.600
Chu Mingcui's face is really thick enough

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.866
Princess Qi is not pure

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.366
You are by my side

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.033
Don't leave this king's sight

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.266
OK

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.800
Don't worry, this king won't let anything happen to you.

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.766
The king has given reasonable instructions to his mother

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.833
Just for Jia Yun

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.100
We'll go back to the palace later and talk together.

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.833
Don't worry.

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.766
I will plead for you

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.666
He Li

14
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.800
Why do you want to leave me?

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.766
I still want to tell you about my fake rhyme

16
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.300
Do you want me to die?

17
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.566
I have no idea how much I have planned for you

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.200
To make you the crown prince

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.466
How much did I plan?

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.800
How much did you give up?

21
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.500
In the end, you have to be reasonable with me

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.033
Do you have a heart?

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:51.233
So you never loved me at all

24
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.166
You don't have to say much.

25
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.633
We have to be reasonable.

26
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.400
From the day I married you

27
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.833
I knew you didn't have me in your heart

28
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.500
I can't compare to five at first.

29
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.300
You are wronged

30
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.766
I think we've been together for over a year

31
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.366
It will slowly get better.

32
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.166
For 7 years

33
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.566
We get along well too

34
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.866
Treat each other as guests

35
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.666
Still loving

36
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.566
But who knows if you're forcing a smile

37
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.233
So

38
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.400
After today

39
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.166
If you put everything aside

40
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.866
You don't have to be wronged

41
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.033
I don't have to please

42
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.800
We are all right

43
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.233
You have no idea how much I paid

44
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.600
If you are not a flute

45
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.833
I will not give up the King of Chu to marry you

46
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.766
You want to be reasonable with me?

47
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:53.566
How could I be so pathetic?

48
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.000
I can't even keep a useless person like you

49
00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.500
You want to care

50
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.233
It's so easy.

51
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.600
We die together

52
00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:38.733
Prince Qin's study is on fire

53
00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:40.800
I heard that King Qi and Princess Qi are both here

54
00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.100
Please go and have a look.
