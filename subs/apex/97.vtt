00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.933
Don't you want me to get pregnant?

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.300
I hope I dream of it

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.466
Shouldn't you be happy that I'm pregnant?

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.766
This is our baby.

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.700
Is our prince

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.800
What are you afraid of?

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800
No nonsense

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.066
Even a son

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.866
It can only be a prince

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.200
I see.

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.966
You didn't stay with me because you loved me

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400
It's because I'm a flute

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.000
And now you want to be the princess

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.300
You want to be queen in the future

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.466
So what if I was?

16
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.433
You should plan everything for me

17
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.666
I'm going to rest first

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.000
And so forth.

19
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.500
Your clothes

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.866
Next month's letter, right?

21
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.000
Then I'll change my clothes

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.600
But you have already reported to your father

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.800
You are pregnant

24
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.666
How do you explain it next?

25
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.900
No need to explain

26
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.866
You don't say I don't say

27
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.800
Who knows my monthly letter?

28
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.833
The palace will never rip off my pants and look at me

29
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.433
It seems that the princess was right

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.466
He doesn't love me.
