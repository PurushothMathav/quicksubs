00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.566
What are you doing? This was given to me by the emperor's grandfather

2
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:14.166
I see the carving is beautiful, I want to see it

3
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.966
This material is absolutely extraordinary

4
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.300
It's a baby.

5
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.500
You need to find a place to hide

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.900
Don't take it out casually.

7
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.533
At least not in a pinch

8
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.366
Take it out once lost

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.000
That's a big sin

10
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.633
Why don't I keep it for you?

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.200
No, I'll take it myself.

12
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.733
Just put it on your body

13
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.600
How can you bring this kind of thing with you?

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.633
What should I do if I lose it?

15
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.900
Oh, I'll be careful.

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.366
Hmm, it works really well.

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.900
Hey

18
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.566
It's rare that he is so happy

19
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.433
Forget it. He wouldn't dare to hit me anyway.

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.666
It's strange that this king is happy when he looks at him and smiles

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.200
Hey

22
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.633
Internal and external injuries are all healed

23
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.400
Oh, as expected of me.

24
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.933
Proud of what?

25
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.233
Okay, fast, it's not that this king is in good health

26
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:27.100
With you, a doctor who is lazy for half a month

27
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.800
It doesn't matter.

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.600
Okay, okay, it has nothing to do with me, okay?

29
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.666
Now that your injuries are healed

30
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.400
Then it's time for the prince and princess to have dinner

31
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.700
Tonight I let her mama cook what you like

32
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.233
Just treat it as a reward

33
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.066
It was obviously Mammy who made it for me

34
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.900
How did it become your favor?

35
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.466
Right, Mom?

36
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.066
If you don't like it, you can skip it.

37
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:59.266
Okay, let's go, no

38
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:02.233
I have to make it clear tonight
