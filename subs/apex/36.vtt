1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.700
You said Yuwen Hao sent someone to assassinate him

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.966
How is that possible?

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:05.800
Radiation

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.200
It's a pity that the assassin killed himself after biting his tongue

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.433
And the minister thought this was ridiculous

6
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.100
Until Princess Chu

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.566
When he was about to murder the emperor's grandfather, it broke out

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.633
I just realized the way

9
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.833
What do you mean?

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.000
At present, Princess Chu is very busy

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.100
He must be waiting for an opportunity to murder Huangzu Buddha

12
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.433
After he succeeds

13
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.566
The fifth brother arranged for a place to be given by the emperor

14
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.666
So far

15
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.400
Help Princess Chu leave the palace and return to the palace

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.566
The second is to confuse the audition

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.600
Sister is extremely injured

18
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.900
Escape this disaster

19
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.466
Imagine if it weren't for the father's discernment

20
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.666
When I found out that Princess Chu had drugged

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.366
When the emperor's grandfather was killed tonight

22
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.766
Who would doubt the mother who was just given by the emperor?

23
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.900
You are talking nonsense.

24
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.200
That night Yuwen Hao Shang Zhou

25
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.866
The imperial doctors said they were helpless

26
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.166
Why should he do this if he works and rests?

27
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:05.966
Humph

28
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.166
The imperial doctors are helpless

29
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.866
Then why did you go back?

30
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.500
The fifth has a good master

31
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.100
It must be your husband and wife who are complicit

32
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.333
Create the illusion of the dead father and the world

33
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.966
You turn black and white nonsense upside down

34
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.633
Your words are enough to know that you have ulterior motives

35
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.466
From now on, the King of Chu will not be allowed to enter the palace shamelessly

36
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.466
Just for you

37
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.566
The purpose is to find out the backlog before

38
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.200
The princess is not allowed to go out
