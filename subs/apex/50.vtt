00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.600
OK

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.866
The steamed buns are delicious to cook

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.600
Did Tang Yang and Xu Yi eat?

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.866
Whatever they do

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.366
I don't see you who should take care of it.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.566
What do I have to do?

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.333
What is such a big palace?

8
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.133
Everything depends on Tang Yang

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.600
Aren't you ashamed as a mistress?

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.866
I remember someone seemed to have said

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.333
What about Mammy Qi?

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.900
Keep me like a dog

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.500
Do you love to argue with this king?

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.633
You didn't say that?

15
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.800
You are so stingy

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.500
I still remember things from so long ago

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.200
If you only remember resentment

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.400
Why don't we talk about it?

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.000
What happened at the Duke's Mansion a year ago

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.400
Ah, why do you say that?

21
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:53.166
Come on, let's get the two of us drunk and save us from worry.

22
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.733
This king has a large number of

23
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.966
Don't care about you

24
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.433
Not necessarily in the future

25
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.800
Ahhhh!

26
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.466
Did you do it on purpose?

27
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.800
I really am not

28
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:23.766
It really is.

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.966
This wine is too spicy

30
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.400
Then stop drinking

31
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.166
How is Sister He?

32
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.300
Yes, but I have the conditions to say

33
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.066
The first is the previous sentence

34
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.866
You can't hit me

35
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.766
Second, you don't deserve my freedom

36
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.266
Of course this is also possible

37
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.300
third

38
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.100
If there is a chance

39
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.700
You'd better divorce me

40
00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.433
The two of us are two wide apart

41
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:00.533
Rejoice

42
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.200
Isn't it nice?
