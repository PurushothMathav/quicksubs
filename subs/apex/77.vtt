1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.600
As a princess

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:06.066
Every word and deed represents the face of my royal family

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.500
Let you explore me and carry me

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.666
You don't care about her condition

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.333
Go to Princess Qi to fight in a private courtyard

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.533
Attempted murder

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.600
You are guilty

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.100
Phoenix folk is Concubine Qin

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.800
It's not the first time for you.

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
Commit such a reckless thing

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.366
If the emperor hadn't interceded for you

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.900
I must have taken your head

13
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.700
I am not allowed to enter the palace alone

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.433
Not even the Supreme Emperor's gold is guaranteed

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.800
This is an iron heart to treat me like this

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.400
Father and daughter-in-law knew they were wrong

17
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.266
Please look at the face of the Supreme Emperor

18
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.033
Expectant daughter-in-law treats King Huai's illness

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000
Be meritorious

20
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.033
Are you saying that there is still a cure for Bai Wang's illness?

21
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.766
Reply that Huang Fei Lang is not terminally ill

22
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.433
Hello daughter-in-law

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.566
Since you can guarantee to cure King Huai's illness

24
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.966
I will believe you again

25
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.633
When did you say it was guaranteed to be cured?

26
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.266
If cured

27
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.600
I will forgive what happened today

28
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.400
If it can't be cured

29
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.166
It is also a crime of bullying the king

30
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.666
both crimes

31
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.633
Then I'll see who can save your life

32
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.333
Do you understand? It's obviously not easy to mess with the Chu family

33
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.366
Bullying the soft and fearing the hard

34
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.600
Half a king is half a tiger

35
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.366
The ancients can't afford it

36
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.166
What nonsense am I talking about?

37
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.700
Thunder, rain and dew are all Junen

38
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.066
I am the one who committed the crime of bullying the king, not you

39
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.900
Of course you don't have back pain when you stand and talk.

40
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.900
Father Emperor is just worried about King Huai's condition

41
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.066
Just try your best.

42
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.733
Father won't really blame

43
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:37.933
If you really blame

44
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.266
This king will bear it for you

45
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.600
My body doesn't know how long it will last

46
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.766
I'm going to die anyway

47
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.766
No need to pull the house dog to start it hard

48
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:47.366
Okay, I accept your intention.

49
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.833
One person does things and one person does things

50
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.100
You don't have to worry about me.

51
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.600
Ungrateful woman

52
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
This king is really affectionate
