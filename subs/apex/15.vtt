6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.066
It's too much now

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.400
Even if it is respected by the father

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.300
This king is also going to divorce you poisonous woman

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.600
The emperor has an edict

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.566
Please ask King Chu and Princess Chu to go to the main hall

Just a moment

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.566
The emperor's grandfather is in good spirits

17
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.100
Could it be that he really saved the emperor's grandfather?

18
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.600
Grandfather Huang, get up

19
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.666
Hey, wait a minute.

20
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.966
Ginseng soup and fire can't be drunk now

21
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.200
How can you make mistakes in front of the Supreme Emperor?

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.966
What do you say you can drink?

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.600
You just woke up now.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.500
You can drink a little millet porridge to nourish your stomach

29
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.466
How could the princess let the emperor of the sun enter the bird food?

30
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.600
I didn't hear what Princess Chu said

31
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.266

That's great.

36
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.866
The emperor left me in trouble

37
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.900
The emperor's grandfather is clumsy

38
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.600
Why don't you let Sun Ernan's aunt see him as pleasing to the eye?

39
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.166
If you can't bear it

40
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.500
Please enter the palace every day

41
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.900

The king will not spare you
