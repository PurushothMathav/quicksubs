00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.033
Sister Qinglian is awake

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.366
Could it be that this bright moon is really capable?

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.666
Interesting how it goes

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.300
Is it relieved?

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.866
It doesn't seem to hurt too much.

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.266
It was you.

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.700
You are suffering from a cold during your period.

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.100
Severe dysmenorrhea caused by accumulation over time

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.366
Has triggered gastrointestinal cramps

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.900
Anemia halo

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.966
This is atropine and ibuprofen.

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.300
Can relieve your stomach cramps and pain

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.600
If you don't feel well, just take two capsules.

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.233
Thank you, Sister Mingyue

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.533
Every month

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.766
I will be tortured to death

17
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.233
But now I really don't feel the pain anymore

18
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.966
You still need to pay more attention to rest.

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.100
Can Sister Mingyue also diagnose and treat me?

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.566
I also want my sister Mingyue to treat us too

21
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.266
I don't know if Sister Mingyue can do it?

22
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.466
Mingyue, my mother is also getting old

23
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.066
Also a little uncomfortable

24
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.700
You see

25
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.100
Take your time, don't worry.

26
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.200
There's plenty of time.
