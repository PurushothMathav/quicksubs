1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.933
If you talk so much, you should die

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.366
I wish this king died

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.033
It's a pity that you didn't get your wish.

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.666
I'll say it first

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:14.200
I really didn't poison his emperor to save his life

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.466
I know. I believe you.

7
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.366
You believe me

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.266
Why plead guilty?

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.700
The entrance should not be

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.833
Worry about me

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.166
Worry about you

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.266
This king is just worried about being dragged down by a stupid woman like you

13
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.166
you

14
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.000
Her Majesty the Princess of Chu asked you to go to the Cloud Palace

15
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.700
Xiaoyun Temple

16
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.333
Your Majesty, are you asking me to go to Kaitai Mountain Lake?

17
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.400
That's fine.

18
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.600
Everything be careful

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.233
Do not act rashly

20
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.200
I know.

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.700
Don't worry, Wen Haodao is finally a person

22
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.833
No need to salute

23
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.466
Since you surprised me

24
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.300
Then go and see how the emperor is doing

25
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.466
Oral mucosal congestion

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.600
Swollen gums

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.400
Find out what was poisoned?

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.166
The minister can't wait

29
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.500
Can you show me the diagnostic log?

30
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.566
Vomited blood twice and then passed out

31
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.166
Weak pulse

32
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.900
Bullet in the lip

33
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.700
This clinical manifestation

34
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.300
This is a symptom of cinnabar poisoning

35
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.133
How is that possible?

36
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.333
There was no cinnabar in the palace of the Supreme Emperor

37
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.166
What's more, cinnabar poisoning requires a large amount of oral administration

38
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.900
The emperor's diet was carefully managed by the descendants

39
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.600
It's impossible to take it by mistake

40
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.466
Princess Chu

41
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.433
You don't want to kill me to get rid of guilt, do you?
