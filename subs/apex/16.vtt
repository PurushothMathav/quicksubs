1
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.300
old five

2
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.500
It can make the emperor's grandfather, Princess Liu Chu, in a hurry

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.300
Emperor Wu is really a good means

4
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.166
As long as the emperor's grandfather is safe

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.500
It's the same whoever is in a hurry

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
You better really think so.

7
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.366
Humph

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.366
Big brother has always been open-mouthed

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.700
Brother Wu, take him to heart first

10
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.633
The fifth brother is angry at me

11
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.200
Didn't he always hate Yuan Qingling the most?

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.866
Why did he still leave him to his grandfather?

13
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.400
Those who can be used are hated again

14
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.100
Can also be tolerated

15
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.066
I've left something behind

16
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.266
You wait for me here.

17
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.066
King of Chu and so on

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.100
Princess Xi has something to do

19
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.900
Brother Hao, how are you?

20
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.000
What's so good about being alive?

21
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.866
And now we are marrying each other

22
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.466
What's good or bad?

23
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.633
Just live

24
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.166
It's just that I hope what I'm afraid of doesn't happen

25
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.033
What are you afraid of?

26
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.633
Afraid that one day

27
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.000
You and him are playing dead for that seat

28
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.366
No, I promised you not to fight

29
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.200
I will abide by

30
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.800
But the matter of standing

31
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.600
The father attaches great importance to

32
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.866
The meaning of the emperor's grandfather

33
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.333
You let the King of Chu fly to sleep

34
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.600
Even King Qi thought you were trying to use this to compete for favor

35
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.800
I didn't mean it.

36
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.666
It is the intention of the emperor's grandfather to keep him

37
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.400
He can't

38
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.866
We need to find out what that woman is up to

39
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.766
I'm leaving early

40
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.100
Brother Hao, you

41
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.533
Even if you don't want to fight

42
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:04.900
I won't let Yuan Qingling either

43
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.400
Received the attention of the Supreme Emperor
