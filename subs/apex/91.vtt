1
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.833
How is Princess Zhang?

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.300
Qi deficiency stagnation

3
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.166
If there is a pulse

4
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.866
The internal organs are damaged

5
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:21.900
Has Princess Chu taken any poison before?

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.266
Or seriously injured

7
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.166
Princess

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.200
The princess once committed suicide with a hairpin

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.700
The wound has not been bandaged

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.166
Sentenced again

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.566
return

12
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.966
I also took Zijin soup

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.366
What's that?

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.100
Evil, wrong

15
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.466
What does Master Zhang mean by this sentence?

16
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.100
How is the princess?

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.800
If the wound is not healed

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.700
He Zijin Soup fish poison is not clear, leaving the root of the disease

19
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.300
There is still the possibility of conditioning recovery

20
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.266
The wound is poisoned

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.300
Even an iron body can't stand it

22
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.500
Now that the princess is out of medicine, how long can she live?

23
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.366
You can see thousands

24
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.633
How is that possible?

25
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.466
The princess used to be in good health

26
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.733
How could it be possible to suddenly run out of medicine and food?

27
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.333
Master Zhang, are you wrong?

28
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.066
The body of the prince

29
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.033
It didn't collapse all at once

30
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.300
Forget it, the old man was helpless, so he retired first

31
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.666
Uncle Zhang, forget it, Your Highness

32
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.400
Prince of Enlightenment

33
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.533
The princess can become what she is today

34
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.100
Isn't it all because of you?

35
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Certainly.

36
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.866
Old slaves also have certain responsibilities

37
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.233
If anything happens to the princess

38
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.133
Old slave

39
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.633
The old slave will always go with the princess

40
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.033
What's the noise?

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.033
I'm not dead yet.
