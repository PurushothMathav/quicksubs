1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.900
Grandma doesn't have to care

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.966
Princess Chu can cure the Supreme Emperor

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.366
There must be something extraordinary about medicine

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.500
Maybe 6 can be cured

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.000
He can cure the emperor

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.766
That's a recipe left by his master

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.466
It's just a mistake

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.766
I don't know what the emperor thinks

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.566
I actually believed what they said

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.400
old five

11
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.466
Concubine Lu believes you

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.866
You can watch your princess not let him mess around

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.600
Although this order is from the emperor

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.466
No defiance

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.100
But if his medical skills are not good

16
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:30.900
Random diagnosis and treatment

17
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.900
Indiscriminate prescriptions

18
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.266
Hurt my arms

19
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.833
This palace has something to say first

20
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.266
Never give up

21
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.633
Lu Mengfei Qing'er will definitely do her best

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.766
Then I'll go in and have a look.

23
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.100
Hui Wang, I will go in with you

24
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.900
I've been helping take care of Brother Six these days

25
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.266
Maybe it can help

26
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.466
Go in and put on the mask first

27
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.100
If you dislike me for not being able to carry a child, you are my son

28
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.800
He was seriously ill and was in a bad mood

29
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.666
And then I see you go in with this thing.

30
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.966
I see that you all dislike him

31
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.700
Isn't it worse than death?
