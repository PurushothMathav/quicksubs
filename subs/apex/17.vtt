00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.866
Ugly princess, you are guilty

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.033
Conviction

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.800
Where does sin come from?

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.200
poor medical skills

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.900
But Qiangzi debuted

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.266
What a poor doctor

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.466
Compared to you

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.700
The imperial doctors in his hospital couldn't make Gu get better

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.766
Not all quacks

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.500
This is a confirmation of my medical skills

11
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.166
Then everything is easy to talk about

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.900
Stop kneeling

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.200
Come and sit down

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:33.233
Tell me if Goode is dead or alive

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.100
How long will you live?

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.000
I can't jump to conclusions yet.

17
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.900
Please allow me to do an examination for you.

18
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.066
Ouch, what the hell is this?

19
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.300
Crying

20
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.800
Come to the emperor, listen

21
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.900
Crying heartbeat

22
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.500
That doesn't sound very healthy.

23
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.466
So Yama won't accept you for the time being

24
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.266
Great altar

25
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.500
Forget it, don't be surprised

26
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.133
Since you said it can be cured

27
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.766
Auntie, do whatever else you can

28
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.066
This is first aid medicine

29
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.966
If you feel uncomfortable in your chest in the future

30
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.400
Just take one.

31
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.600
This is the medicine I want to take now.

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.766
Just take it with water.

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.200
I'm going to pour water

34
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:57.400
I didn't mean it.

35
00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:00.866
Princess Huang's grandfather doesn't like long hats

36
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.600
The princess is at the market

37
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.266
Better to be steady

38
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.600
Thanks.
