00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.566
Please punish the father

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.100
You're going to take the blame for someone else

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.200
Pull me to the mountain

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.000
old five

5
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.900
You are always crowing

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.066
Why are you so careless this time?

7
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.133
If I don't punish you heavily this time, it will be fine.

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.800
noisy

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.033
Head bone pain

Father Emperor

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.800
I don't need Xue Yuyi anymore

12
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.600
Just leave the deeds of Princess Chu

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.766
Why does the fifth child say this is negligence?

14
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:33.100
If you want to blame this, you can't blame Princess Chu

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.966
Brat, wait a minute

16
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.833
He takes care of you himself

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.600
The Supreme Emperor said this to protect Yuwen Hao

18
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.400
Cheap him

19
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.033
The father's minister will retire first

20
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.600
The grandson retired.

21
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.000
How was I wronged?

22
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.000
Kicked hard and it doesn't matter if I'm wronged

23
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:06.666
But if today's affairs are not handled well, it will cost you a hard life

24
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.700
In the huge capital

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.200
There are many people who want to take care of their names

26
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.866
You dragged my aunt back from the gate of hell

27
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:20.200
I'm helping my aunt fight with evil spirits

28
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.566
You are not afraid

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.800
I'm not afraid of death either way

30
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:29.800
Hey

31
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.233
Lao Wu is a smart person

32
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
Too bad he's blind

33
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.933
Therefore, I hope your medical skills are sufficient

34
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.300
Can cure his blindness

35
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.766
Xianxia, no matter how brilliant my medical skills are, it is useless

36
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.800
Hey

37
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.066
What if you became Princess Chu?

38
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.200
Brother Pao only has me in his heart

39
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.866
He's willing to take any blame for me

40
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.233
Heart death will protect me

41
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:08.100
So you admit that you put the wisteria
