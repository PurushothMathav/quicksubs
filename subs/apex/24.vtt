1
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:01.966
Zijunta

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:06.066
Lord, how did you become so vicious?

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.866
Don't talk about husband and wife

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.400
Even a stranger

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.466
You wouldn't do that to him.

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.966
How can you bear it? It's him first.

7
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.700
Help him

8
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.600
Both Zijindan

9
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.900
The princess is about to take this medicine

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.800
What is this medicine?

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.333
Zijindan can be turned into vitality

12
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.133
Excellent for your injury

13
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.566
This medicine is very precious

14
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.800
Each prince has only one

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.233
Prince Chu was not willing to take this medicine once

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.300
Is that better?

17
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.966
What do you think? This king didn't expect it either.

18
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.966
You didn't even treat your own wounds

19
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.700
You are different now than before

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.066
We need to talk

21
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.900
As long as you don't hit me

22
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.233
Talk whatever you want

23
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.966
What medicine did you give your grandfather?

24
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.066
Dopa

25
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.400
For myocardial infarction and heart failure

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.566
breathing difficulties

27
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.366
Who gave it to you, this king has never heard of it

28
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.833
That's my own medicine

29
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.300
The world is so big

30
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.166
The prince has never seen him

31
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.600
Never heard of him

32
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:34.966
More to go

33
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.933
Obviously you're not telling the truth

34
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.066
You don't believe me?

35
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.366
Naturally, I don't think I'm telling the truth.

36
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.300
Then what kind of medicine did you scare this king?

37
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.366
Why did this king lose consciousness?

38
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.000
You can't move.

39
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.233
That's not poison

40
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:49.800
Is an anesthetic

41
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.700
For surgery

42
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.866
And purple gold soup

43
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.866
The same thing.

44
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.800
Purple gold soup is poison

45
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.133
So

46
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:04.066
The prince knows very well that he has given me poison, right?

47
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.466
The prince is so cruel

48
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.066
If you want me to die so much

49
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.900
Why give me the purple golden egg?

50
00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.366
I'm dead.

51
00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.800
Isn't it as you want?
