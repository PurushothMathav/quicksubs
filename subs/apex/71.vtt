00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.300
How can you say that Chu Dayou is also a Chu family member so soon?

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.900
Yuwen Hao just listens to me

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.466
Just help me get revenge

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.000
The princess doesn't know

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.533
The days you disappeared

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.600
The prince is really lost

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.766
Old slave look

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.966
The prince has a deep love for you

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.666
Forget it, he didn't hit my board before

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.000
You poisoned me

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.066
deep love

12
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.000
I look at him

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.700
Just for your own face

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.900
Why don't the princess ask the prince clearly?

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.900
OK

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.033
Sooner or later, the two of us have to be reasonable

17
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.000
Better to make it clear

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.833
Let's go

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.500
Princess Tang Yang

20
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.200
What about the prince, I have something to say to him

21
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.033
The prince has gone to Huai Palace

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.333
Should have had a good rest

23
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.500
But His Royal Highness King Huai may be soon and soon

24
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.800
Oh, I mean

25
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.400
When I was in the palace, I heard that King Huai had been sick

26
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.866
What does he have?

27
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.033
Is it labor and illness?

28
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.900
King Huai is also a hard-working man

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.300
Can this illness be cured?

30
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.066
No one will die

31
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.000
Why not?

32
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.133
The princess is so powerful

33
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:10.900
Labor can also be governed

34
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.100
Even the imperial physicians in the palace are helpless

35
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.500
Before antibiotics came out

36
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.866
Filao is indeed a terminal illness

37
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.033
You can only kill yourself

38
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.300
How is he doing?

39
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.600
The emperor has no one to prepare for the funeral

40
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.800
I heard from the inner government that even the coffin is ready

41
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.133
The subordinates have already prepared the carriage

42
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.200
The princess should go too

43
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.700
It might be the last time. Okay, let's go

44
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.533
The old slave went to report to the prince

45
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.000
Princess, wait here. Okay

46
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.833
It seems that the king's situation is really not good

47
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.433
Fortunately, I have medicine in my hand

48
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.666
Maybe you can.

49
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.833
What is there to sigh about Princess Chu?

50
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.866
Isn't Brother Hao treating you well now?

51
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.000
I never knew you were such a good tool
