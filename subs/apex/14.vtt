1
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.700
You let go and you don't let go

2
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.800
I'll be rude to you.

3
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.266
Yellow Duck

4
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.766
Violent man

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.266
Princess

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.266
Prince, what's wrong with him?

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.200
Prince, he is too sad to pass out.

8
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.600
Come and help me

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.633
Oh good lord

10
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.766
You will get better in a while

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.966
Let me stay in the palace to continue diagnosis and treatment

12
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.766
The medicine has been used in time

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.800
The emperor should be fine

14
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.766
But is he willing to believe me?

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.166
You don't make the same mistake twice.

16
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.166
If you do it

17
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.300
You'll be dead before I die

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.666
Why don't you listen to what I have to say?

19
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.066
What poison are you scared of?

20
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.866
Poisoned the Supreme Emperor in the palace

21
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.233
Am I dying? Say

22
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.200
That's not poison

23
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.300
It's emergency medicine.

24
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.466
The situation of the emperor

25
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.100
It's not as bad as the imperial doctor said

26
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.700
I'm saving him

27
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:21.233
This king did not know that he had married a legendary doctor

28
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:30.300
Let's go with this king to the front of my father and emperor to take the crime. Let's go

29
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.366
Ok I'll take the blame

30
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.733
At that time, I will say that you support it.

31
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.266
Do you think Father will believe

32
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.966
Then I'll say Chu Mingcui

33
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:40.900
I bit him to death

34
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.500
I asked your sweetheart to be buried with me

35
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.400
You dare to frame him

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.833
I think it's too long, you Yu Wenhao

37
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.766
I didn't let you bully me by sending it to your palace

38
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:52.133
You used to be a soldier who defended your country

39
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:53.300
You bully a woman like that

40
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.800
What kind of hero are you?

41
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:59.900
This king never wanted to marry you, a poisonous woman

42
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.700
Since you set me up

43
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.333
Why should I suffer all this?

44
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.366
Not to mention

45
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.200
You are now plotting against my grandfather

46
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.500
This king is going to kill you now, don't kill you

47
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.166
Please do something

48
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.600
Divorce me before you kill me

49
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:16.700
I will not die as you, Princess Chu
