00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Ah!

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.600
Ah!

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.833
Meet a family of Internet trolls

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.833
More tired than watching me

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.600
Well, it's cleared. If you want this, it's easy for me to find it.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.600
Another Internet trolls

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.766
Hey, His Royal Highness King Qi

8
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.766
Any advice?

9
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.200
If it was Princess Qi who did it earlier

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.700
I suggest you shut up

11
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.866
Why shut up?

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.666
Don't think that Father has asked you to treat Sixth Brother

13
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.400
Do you think it's over?

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.000
You have to admit your mistake.

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.000
Persuade him to apologize

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.800
Otherwise, I'll go to the queen mother's place

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.833
The imperial grandmother let them judge

18
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.466
How old are you?

19
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.800
Are you not weaned yet?

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.866
Everything has to go to the father, mother and queen

21
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.366
Don't you have a brain yourself?

22
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.566
I am but he should kiss me

23
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
How dare you humiliate me over and over again?

24
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.500
Am I wrong?

25
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.766
You believe everything Chu Mingcui says

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.166
Why don't you think about it?

27
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.433
Why should I hurt him?

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.466
Why would I kill him in public?

29
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.333
What do I want?

30
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.666
I'm not in enough trouble.

31
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.800
Am I not dying fast enough?

32
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.866
Because you're a scheming poisonous woman

33
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.766
Harming people doesn't need a reason at all

34
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.900
You go to hurt Mingcui first

35
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.000
Then he deceived his father

36
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.833
Now you're here to stir up trouble in my house again

37
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.766
You are jealous

38
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.766
Could it be that he went to the imperial court to complain, so he wanted to harm the sixth brother?
