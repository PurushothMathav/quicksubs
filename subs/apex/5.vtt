00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.000
Yu Wenhao's tiger is not powerful

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.600
Do you think I'm a sick cat?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.266
I went to the royal palace

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.700
The justifiable Princess Chu

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.500
It's not that you say it's not.

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.400
I only know how to pretend to be a king in the house

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:17.000
You have the ability to say the same in front of the emperor and the queen mother

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.166
Why are you speechless?

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.100
If you don't say anything, I'll take it as agreeing.

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.000
Save lives

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.500
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.166
Princess Chu

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.800
The young master was pushed to the ground by your own hands

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.933
My eyes accidentally hit the corner of the table

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.566
To cause the wound to fester

16
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.100
Are you dying?

17
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.400
You say you don't even have children of your own

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.266
I don't want to help others raise children

19
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.233
Now he is going to treat the young master like a fake

20
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.166
You still think our young master

21
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.833
Isn't it bad enough for you?

22
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.266
Qi Moumou, I really want to save people

23
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.333
Just let me in

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.866
I think you think our young master died too slowly.

25
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.933
Still want to hurt him

26
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.866
Don't you think

27
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.400
The princess wouldn't even let go of a dying child

28
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.733
Too vicious

29
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.200
If this gets out

30
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.833
Wouldn't it ruin the reputation of the prince?

31
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.300
I'm not going to argue with you

32
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.700
Your Highness, let me come in and treat Hogg

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.400
If something really happened

34
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.500
To kill to light

35
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.066
At your disposal

36
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.833
at your disposal

37
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.300
Your life

38
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.800
Is it also worthy to compare with Brother Huo's life? I

39
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.633
I'm not.

40
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.633
Look at the plane

41
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.066
Oh, people's hearts are secret

42
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.066
Open the door you poisonous woman

43
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.166
Master Huo was brought up by me since he was a child. If he is gone

44
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.500
I will fight with you

45
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.766
Lin Xinxin, get out of here

46
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:53.766
Take it easy

47
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:54.833
The child is still alive

48
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.033
Everyone is only half breathing

49
00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.100
How to save

50
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.266
Do you really think you are most immortals?

51
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.200
Your Highness, what can we do?

52
00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.433
Call the auxiliary guard

53
00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:10.800
Break the door down

54
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.266
5 Fools

55
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.533
Speak wildly

56
00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:15.700
See how you end
