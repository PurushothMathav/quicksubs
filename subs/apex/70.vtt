1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.500
It was him

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.766
Did I ever offend him?

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.900
The Marquis of Hui Ding is named Chu Dayou

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.500
Chu family

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.033
This is interesting

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.166
What are you going to do?

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.233
You were sold to the brothel

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.266
Sending it out will hurt your retail.

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.166
It's not easy to deal with it on the surface.

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.333
I have a good idea

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.200
We will repay them with their own way

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.600
Knock him out and put a sack on him

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
Take all the tokens of identity on him

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.433
Throw it all away

15
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.233
Then sell him to the bitter cold at the border

16
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.300
Let him contribute to the construction of Beitang

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.600
No, it's fine

18
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.200
The princess' idea is really good

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.266
Master Tang Yao, go and do it

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.566
Yes, the subordinate will definitely do it well.

21
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.566
Who is pumping big oil?

22
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
Yuan Qingling

23
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.766
How does it feel to ask others in the brothel

24
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.100
Against me

25
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.800
He deserved it.

26
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:11.566
Go ahead.

27
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.100
Go ahead.

28
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.766
Something bad

29
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.000
What's wrong so

30
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.200
Your uncle went out drinking after returning to the tripod and was robbed

31
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.033
There has been no news for a day and a night now.

32
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:27.600
What? Did Brother Hao find something?

33
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.433
Then Princess Chu has a trace now

34
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.100
So that's kind of the good news.

35
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.500
Princess Chu has now been found

36
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.000
It is said that he had a conflict with the fifth emperor brother

37
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.200
He is now safely back in the mansion.

38
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.700
How could this be?

39
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.766
It shouldn't be like this
