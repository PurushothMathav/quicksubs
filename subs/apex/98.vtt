1
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.166
Princess Qin is pregnant

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.766
I'm going to report to my father

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.966
The father thinks of the fetus in his womb

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.200
If it's a boy

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.900
The eldest grandson of the royal family

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.066
And Chu Shoufu is still there

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.966
Can't get to him for the time being

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.433
But don't worry.

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.966
This king will not end here

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.466
I will definitely give you justice.

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.200
As long as I dare to bully you

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.666
The king wants his life

13
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.200
You want Chu Mingcui's life too?

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.466
Who is Chu Hongcui?

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.166
The king only knows

16
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.633
Princess Qi

17
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.966
Awake now

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.200
I'm not in love, I'm so angry

19
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.100
Love Anger

20
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.400
What does this mean?

21
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.533
I don't mean anything else.

22
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.666
Just complimenting you

23
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.233
Ha ha.

24
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.066
I got a baby

25
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.166
This kid didn't come easy

26
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.833
I want to celebrate

27
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.300
I'm having a feast tomorrow

28
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.333
banquet

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.100
Don't you have no life?

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.566
Yes!

31
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.166
So

32
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.366
The child is to be kept

33
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.766
You want to frame Princess Chu

34
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.300
Your Highness, you are drunk

35
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.100
Don't talk nonsense

36
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.266
I'm not drunk

37
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.600
You're not the Trill I used to know

38
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.666
I used to know you

39
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.500
mountain

40
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.633
Big River

41
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.200
No one can compare to you

42
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:42.966
Did something happen?

43
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.066
You tell me.

44
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.466
Why have you become like this?

45
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.800
Say something

46
00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:54.233
Or are you just like this?

47
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.100
When drunk, take a good rest

48
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.200
Prepare well for tomorrow

49
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.500
Tweety. Tweety.
