1
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.466
I just got on my own

2
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.033
How could this be?

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.266
How could this be?

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.666
The Emperor

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.900
The prince took a case that night

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.066
The effect of re-serving in the short term will be greatly discounted.

7
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.833
The injury is serious and hopeless

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.366
You wake up later

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.233
Are you really going to die here?

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.433
He also pulled the princess away

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.766
Don't call me 123

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.166
To this

13
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.200
The mind can depend on people

14
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.833
The prince is breathing again

15
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.633
The minister was saved

16
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.900
Fortunately you succeeded

17
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.433
Fortunately, I didn't kill you, my lord

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.433
King Ma Chu took the side hall

19
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.300
Shovel

20
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.166
Return the dead emperor to him

21
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.000
This old five

22
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.966
Princess Chu was clearly out of breath just now

23
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.100
Kind of capable

24
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.066
This dead man

25
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.200
He was saved

26
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.466
Jia Baonan, don't really die

27
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.700
I can't afford this life

28
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.600
Crying dirty
