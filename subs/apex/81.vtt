00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.200
Princess Qi, you can't be of any help here

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.800
You might as well go out for tea and tell right and wrong

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.233
Do what you're good at

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.766
Concubine Lu, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.533
I really didn't help much

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.900
Why did you let him out?

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:13.566
These days

8
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.800
If it weren't for Princess Qi's saddle in the palace

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.600
Stabilize the heart

10
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200
This palace has long been in chaos

11
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.166
I don't know if you have any real skills

12
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.533
I know how to play prestige here

13
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.500
Empress Lu Fei

14
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.000
It's your son lying in bed, life and death uncertain

15
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.933
I was ordered to save him, not harm him

16
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.566
I have already explained about wearing a mask

17
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.833
Feel free to speculate

18
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.300
But you shouldn't be with Princess Qi

19
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.600
This affects me to rectify him

20
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.966
What's the intention, I don't know

21
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:35.966
But

22
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.533
You must love your son more than he does

23
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.000
If you want to be sane

24
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.466
Should be on the same side as my doctor

25
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.466
After all, we all hope that King Huai will recover

26
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.600
Princess Chu, you said this

27
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.300
I don't want King Huai to get better

28
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.233
I don't know why you hate me so much

29
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.566
To provoke me again and again

30
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.266
What are you afraid of?

31
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.266
Empress Lu Fei

32
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.700
Please think twice

33
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.666
Never mind.

34
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.566
Don't bother with him

35
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.100
Okay, then I won't do it. I'm sick and dead.

36
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.233
Your heart isn't too damaged.

37
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.766
Coughing up blood

38
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:14.933
About 7 days.

39
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.466
You can get some control

40
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.733
But it's a long road to treatment.

41
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.300
You must cooperate absolutely

42
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.500
I will give you medicine

43
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.333
But the medicine can't be stopped

44
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.433
Don't stop

45
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.900
If you stop taking it

46
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.466
I really can't save you

47
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.666
Now.

48
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.400
Are you capable of saving me?

49
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.200
Medicine is not absolute

50
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.766
The first half month is the best period for treatment

51
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.100
After surviving, you can decide to be weak.

52
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.766
Even the imperial doctor said that King Huai only had three days left

53
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.833
He said to survive for half a month first
