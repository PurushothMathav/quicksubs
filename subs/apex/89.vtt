00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.066
What are you angry about?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.066
What right do you have to lose your temper?

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.800
I came to treat you kindly

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.233
Do I still want to see your face?

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.500
I can't cure you

6
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.700
I still don't know how my father convicted me

7
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.033
I warn you.

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.800
If you dare to vomit again

9
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.200
I will strangle you immediately

10
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.600
I'm willing to let you cause trouble for everyone

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.466
Concubine Lu, King Huai's condition is temporarily stable

12
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.133
But he threw up all the medicine he had taken before

13
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.600
If he continues like this

14
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.266
Then I can't cure him

15
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.966
You can't blame me

16
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.366
Son

17
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.566
Why are you like this?

18
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.300
It's obviously getting better

19
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.833
Why don't you insist on taking medicine, Huai'er?

20
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.500
If you leave

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.300
How do you let the mother concubine live?

22
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.433
Just be a mother, please

23
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.066
Take your medicine well, okay?

24
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.700
Do you have to make the mother concubine kneel down and beg you?

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.700
I promise you.

26
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.933
You always take your medicine well

27
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.566
Why didn't you take yesterday's medicine?

28
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.200
Son

29
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.433
What the hell is going on?

30
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.800
Princess Qi told the king

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.000
Said that the father emperor sent Princess Chu to come

32
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.433
Just perfunctory to this king

33
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.900
In fact, my father has long known in his heart

34
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.300
I can't live

35
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.800
They even made the coffin

36
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.533
you

37
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.200
you

38
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:29.533
Princess Ji
