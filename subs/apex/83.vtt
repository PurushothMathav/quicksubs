00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.900
How dare you beat me with this slap

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.300
I fought for my father

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.766
You are blind

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.466
It's your business to favor Chu Mingcui

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.566
But I was ordered to treat King Huai

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.533
You speak falsely and falsely, you are questioning the will of the Holy Spirit

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.333
i

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.600
i

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:17.000
before

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.166
Chu Mingcui put wisteria in my sachet

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.000
Isn't it just to assassinate the Supreme Emperor Mother?

12
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.366
Then smear the King of Chu to pave the way for you

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.666
Now I will rule King Huai

14
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.800
He's got everything to get in the way.

15
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.733
I'm just afraid that after King Huai is cured

16
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.800
Are Yuwen Hao and I winning again?

17
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.400
I don't care how you two seize power

18
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.700
But His Royal Highness the King of Qi

19
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.300
The Supreme Emperor and King Huai are your ambitions

20
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.266
You really have the heart to risk their lives

21
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.066
Pave the way for your own rights?

22
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.033
I won't do that next year

23
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.033
he

24
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.266
He was kind.

25
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.300
He wouldn't do that.

26
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.066
He won't.

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700
Chu Mingcui's intentions are so obvious

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.033
It's okay if this silly Bai Tian can't see it

29
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.533
Yuwen Hao is so shrewd that he can't see it

30
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.266
Being played around by him

31
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.500
Which language number is shrewd?

32
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.466
A belly full of grass

33
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.666
Brain full of grass

34
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.600
Who do you call a fool?

35
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.033
Who do you call a fool?

36
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.033
Whose head is full of grass talking about you?

37
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:31.466
I'll go get some medicine for King Huai

38
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.566
I'll go first

39
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.166
What do you want to do?
