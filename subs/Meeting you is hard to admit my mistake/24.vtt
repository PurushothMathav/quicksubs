00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.733
Nuo girl, you are here

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.400
Aunt Nuo girl

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200
I want to hear you call me

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.500
aunt

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.400
aunt

6
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:17.966
Hey

7
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.600
It's this city that binds you and Shijun

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.366
You know it all

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.066
I already knew it

10
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.166
2Kg child

11
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.066
The one who most resembles his father

12
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.900
The way he looks at you

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.766
Just like the way his father looked at me back then

14
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.900
It's the same.

15
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.766
Luo girl

16
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.166
Although I don't know between the two of you

17
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.233
So what happened?

18
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:56.466
But if the 4th lord hurts you, I will replace him.

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.066
Apologize to you.

20
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.266
From the very beginning

21
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.200
He thinks it's his fault

22
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.266
Shouldn't like you

23
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.666
He has always felt that his identity

24
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.366
Will bring you criticism

25
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.533
After all, there are backups hidden

26
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.100
There will inevitably be gossip when it gets out

27
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.400
How can you, a little girl, stand this?

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.033
But it doesn't really matter.

29
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.066
I was with his father

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
It was not accepted by the family at first

31
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.266
Because we are brother and sister

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Except I was adopted.

33
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:43.233
But even if the worldly eyes are not optimistic

34
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.066
We still haven't given up on each other

35
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.566
Instead, choose to be with the one you love

36
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.700
When I told him this

37
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:55.366
I thought he figured it out

38
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.966
He was never willing to communicate this with me

39
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:02.500
He didn't even get a chance to stand by his side

40
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.566
Don't give it to me

41
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.300
How did I find the courage to walk up to him?
