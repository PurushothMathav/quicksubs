00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.700
The way you like someone

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.900
No one knows better than me

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.533
Gu Zijun, do you still think I was

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.866
That little girl walking behind your butt?

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.400
I don't like you anymore.

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.066
Do you hear me?

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.466
I don't like you anymore.

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.366
My mom is sick

9
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.500
He misses you.

10
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.466
I'll go to my aunt's side.

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.233
But I don't want to see you there.

12
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.466
Miaomiao

13
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.866
Here you are, auntie, it's me

14
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.666
It's Luo Luo

15
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.566
I studied abroad before

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.466
I didn't hear until I came back that you were sick.

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.166
My old problem is no big deal

18
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.600
It's all the Fourth Army, they make a fuss

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.966
Don't let me leave the hospital to worry about you?

20
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.000
Uncle, they are also for your good.

21
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.233
I know their good intentions

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.400
But people always feel that they are dragging them down

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.300
aunt

24
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.833
How can anyone feel that their mother is a burden?

25
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.500
Don't think too much.

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.100
Don't say this

27
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.800
Nuo girl, how have you been abroad all these years?

28
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.433
Are you not wronged?
