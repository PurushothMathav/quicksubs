00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.900
Very good classmates and teachers are very good

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.866
I still made a lot of friends

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.766
Have you got a boyfriend yet?

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.966
Not yet.

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.300
You child

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.966
How is it the same as 4th Jun?

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.800
Are you looking for a partner?

8
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.866
I'm not worried about anything else

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:24.200
I'm afraid, just his temper?

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.500
No one is looking after him

11
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.866
Will he grow old alone?

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.066
Nuo girl, if you have someone you like

13
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.966
You have to be bold.

14
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.466
Don't let yourself regret

15
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.600
Even if everyone disagrees

16
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.633
Does it matter?

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.800
Like you said.

18
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.866
No child feels like their mother

19
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.833
Is a hassle

20
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.566
So there is no mother

21
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:56.166
I don't want my children to be happy

22
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.800
Emotions are a matter of two people after all

23
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.566
Accompanied for life

24
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:09.300
After all, it's still the one standing by your side

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.000
How is my aunt doing?

26
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.033
Grandma's body is much better

27
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.500
But Lulu, you won't leave when you come back this time, right?

28
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.766
I haven't decided yet.

29
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.866
Why is that?

30
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.266
Is it your boyfriend who wants to develop abroad?

31
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.100
Not because of him

32
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:37.033
Is it because I want to say
