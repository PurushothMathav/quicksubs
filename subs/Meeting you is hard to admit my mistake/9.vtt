00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.400
You deleted me.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.900
Su Tang is the person you want to marry, right?

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.900
Is Miss Qin talking about me?

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.133
Ah forgot to introduce

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.466
I am a new girlfriend

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.600
You call him uncle

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.800
Maybe you'll have to call me aunt in the future

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.833
Really?

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.600
Then I wish you happiness

10
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.800
Why do you say so?

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.966
I just can't stand it when someone is clearly in disaster

12
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.766
Still don't admit

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.066
So

14
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.300
I want to see how long you can be stubborn

15
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.366
You don't have to worry about me.

16
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:48.666
You don't take a pen.

17
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:52.266
So sloppy, thank you uncle, I'll go in first

18
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.566
Winning again

19
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.700
Uncle, can you give this to me?

20
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:00.900
uncle

21
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.100
I hope you have been so kind to me all my life

22
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.500
Why did you lie to me?

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.833
You obviously have someone you like, why didn't you tell me?

24
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.600
What are you throwing a tantrum about?

25
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.566
Did I lose my temper?

26
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.666
Obviously you are hanging me

27
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.000
Qin Luo, have you been drinking again?

28
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.400
Said I lost my temper

29
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:25.700
Gu Sijun

30
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.366
Did you really think I said I liked you?

31
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.600
I will love you for the rest of my life.

32
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.266
I didn't make you like me.

33
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.866
A lifetime is so long

34
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.066
I can't like you alone.

35
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:43.166
Then don't like it

36
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.800
Gu Sixuan

37
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:56.066
Do you know that I'm really losing it?

38
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:12.166
Come here, the bride comes closer to the groom, yes

39
00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.433
That's it.

40
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.366
We got married.

41
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.300
Miss Qin, we will get married on the 10th of next month.

42
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.866
You must come to participate
