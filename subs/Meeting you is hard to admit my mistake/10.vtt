00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.500
Miss Qin, we will get married on the 10th of next month.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.033
You must come to participate

3
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.866
It was a dream

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.833
Maybe this relationship should have ended long ago

5
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.200
It's an offer from Horseshoe College, City of London

6
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.200
My design was approved.

7
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.833
It seems that even providence wants me to leave

8
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.466
Why is the doll hanging on the key missing?

9
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.166
Where will it be lost?

10
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.166
Lolo, why are you calling me here in such a hurry?

11
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.300
The online pendant Gu Sijun gave me is missing.

12
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.666
I think it might be lost here.

13
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.100
That pendant has been close to the body for four years

14
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.833
How could it fall?

15
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.333
Oops, let's talk about it again

16
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.466
If it really falls here

17
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.933
So how good does he bring you?

18
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.200
Can we still meet?

19
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.000
Miaomiao I

20
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.600
I've decided to give up.

21
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.066
Do you really want to give up after so many years?

22
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.266
Well, I can't find a reason to keep going.

23
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:40.066
And I received a letter from a foreign college over

24
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.166
Leave at the end of the month

25
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.200
So soon, you really thought about it.

26
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.633
Let's go get our stuff

27
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.100
How interesting do you say small things?

28
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.100
Door code

29
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.500
It has the same license plate number as his precious car

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500
It's all 0814 and I don't know what it means.

31
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.200
It was my lunar birthday

32
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.166
But maybe it's a coincidence
