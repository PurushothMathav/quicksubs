1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.766
But there's always a stench

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.100
Smells like a pigsty

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:08.200
Rich people are definitely not butchers

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.700
It smells like animals.

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.800
Or he kept expensive animals

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.033
Or rather

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.666
It's something that needs to be taken care of by the boss himself.

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.066
Really?

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.266
Your Highness, this is the last horse farmer

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.466
They sell horses

11
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.866
But only horses

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:29.666
I heard about that.

13
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.700
The horses of the big money generals were also bought by their families

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.466
Can't be wrong, it's him

15
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.233
Come on. Let's go in.

16
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.166
Xiao Chen just died

17
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.666
Go after it

18
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.133
What's wrong, Xiao Chen?

19
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.333
Did you run away?

20
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.000
Your Highness is not me

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700
The dog saw me and came after me

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.100
He took his own life.

23
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.300
No, so cruel

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.700
But I found this on him

25
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.700
What's the matter, Your Highness?

26
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.466
Master Xu

27
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.233
This bastard divides the account into powder

28
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.900
You have to compile these accounts to know where the money is going
