00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.500
So you're not convinced?

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.866
If you don't agree, then let's compare

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.166
If I lose, I leave the hotpot

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.766
If I win, you keep checking for me

5
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.300
Your Highness, what do you want to compare?

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.433
That's arithmetic

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.233
As long as you count faster than me, you

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.500
Your Highness is serious

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.466
A gentleman's word

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.433
Horses are hard to chase

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
It's like, yeah.

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.800
Your Highness, haven't you started yet?

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.466
Xiao Chan, what do I usually teach you?

14
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.700
Do things calmly

15
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.033
Open your mouth

16
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.700
Is it delicious?

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.566
The melon seeds outside the haze are the best to eat

18
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.900
Hum, I'll give you all the delicious food.

19
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.900
Ah, for a while

20
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.300
You are eating melon seeds

21
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.966
Watch how your Highness wins
