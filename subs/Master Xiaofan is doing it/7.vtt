1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.400
If the former

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.533
Number of plums in the corner

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.366
Ling Han opened alone

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.700
I know it's not snow

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.400
For the dark fragrance

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.333
At this time, Princess Shiyu, your character is noble

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.766
The dark fragrance is refreshing

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.233
The latter is

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.100
Thousand Mountain Bird Flying

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.333
Mankind is gone

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.266
Lone Boat Kasana

12
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.266
Solo fishing Hanjiang snow

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.566
All the world

14
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.900
It's all worldly

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.066
This poem should be a quatrains through the ages

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.966
I didn't expect this waste prince

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:37.033
To make such a magnificent poem

18
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.033
Kind of interesting.

19
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.033
Impossible

20
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.600
It wasn't Chen Yuanxiao who gave the seat

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.300
This is from the poem of the immortal king Zhongjing

22
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.666
Fourth Prince

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.400
Can there be evidence

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.466
Wang University Senai is made in Hanaman Building

25
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:02.033
The great genius of the world who is willing to be a flywing bird in heaven

26
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.566
This teacher must have come from him

27
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.366
What poem was written by Wang University

28
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:14.666
Of course, Wang Zhongjing is my former Shixian

29
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:18.300
Who else could it be if it wasn't from him?

30
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.266
Nonsense, that poem was clearly written by my Highness

31
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.266
Hahaha

32
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.900
Thirteenth brother

33
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.566
It's not enough for you to copy a poem

34
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.200
You still have three copies in a row

35
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.733
It really disgraced my royal family

36
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.066
Copy poetry

37
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.066
Who is that?

38
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:36.166
What makes you think I copied him?

39
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.966
He didn't copy me

40
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.800
I think I might as well call Master Wang

41
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.166
Face to face with the thirteenth brother
