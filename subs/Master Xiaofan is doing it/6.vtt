00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.966
Sounds of nature

2
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.600
Just never heard such a sound

3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.866
Have you heard such beautiful music?

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.300
That sounds pretty good.

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.600
Brilliant! What kind of instrument is this?

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200
Although the shape is strange

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.633
But the melody is elegant

8
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.966
Income Teana

9
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.866
Hmm miracle

10
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.233
It's just a coincidence

11
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.000
Ugly

12
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.633
Dare to ask the thirteenth prince what kind of musical instrument is this?

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.466
My name is piano.

14
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.733
If the princess likes it

15
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:46.100
I gave the piano and sheet music to the princess

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.433
Thank you, Your Highness

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.066
End of the first round

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.266
For the second round, please write poems with snow

19
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.666
Uh, grass and trees are moving snakes

20
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.800
The warmth of old tree roots

21
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.700
Money is buried in deep snow

22
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.000
The smelly house has flowers blooming

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.600
This poem is like a joke

24
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.733
Hahaha, that sucks.

25
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:09.800
What the hell?

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.700
Ice under the bridge

27
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.966
Stranger people go to extremes

28
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.866
Xiao Shu Lou Pavilion

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.266
I see Tianshan snow

30
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.133
OK

31
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.133
The monarch is good

32
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.866
There are also thirteenth princes

33
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.833
Dare to ask my father-in-law, this snow is Guling Snow's snow

34
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.000
Or the snow in the sky

35
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.466
Same with snow

36
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.566
What difference could it make?

37
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.000
The thirteenth brother pretends to be a ghost

38
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.533
If there are no ingredients

39
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.166
Just get off

40
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.466
Princess, what do you think?

41
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.766
Both
