00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.366
How is it?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.700
In my opinion, these three problems are simply unsolvable

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.700
This is an unsolvable matter.

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.466
unsolvable

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.966
May as well ask if these three problems are solved?

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.333
It's a deliberate confrontation

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.400
In my opinion, it is better to continue to be so old

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.966
That's right, the old man has been studying the books of sages for more than ten years

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.000
I had never heard of that before.

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.166
Sister Wu is absolutely

11
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.266
I see you are ignorant

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.966
What big money wins the first talent

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.300
Hmph shit you deserve it

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.566
How dare you be the hall master and scold the great scholar?

15
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.866
It's just unreasonable so far

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.066
You said he couldn't

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.366
Put up or shut up.

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.900
If I can answer

19
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.166
How about the fourth brother not letting you have the soldiers?

20
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:41.966
you

21
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.566
OK, if you can't answer

22
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.200
Go to the border and join the army

23
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.400
Give me the song

24
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.966
Go out and get it back

25
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.366
It's a deal.

26
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.300
It's finally done.

27
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.766
Your Highness, you will answer the question tomorrow

28
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.333
Why are you still fiddling with it?

29
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.600
These things?

30
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.200
Wait a minute it's a little loud

31
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.500
Cover your ears
