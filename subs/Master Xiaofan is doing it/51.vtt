1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.433
Emperor

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.200
Something bad happened to the waterfall

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:12.766
His Highness the Thirteenth Prince beat Lord Xu down

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.400
Then send a few imperial doctors to take a look

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.200
This

6
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.766
This household department has given 13.

7
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.833
What to do is his business

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.366
I only look at the results

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.300
Obey

10
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.066
Today you make a fuss about complementarity

11
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.066
He also severely injured Lord Xu

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.466
Tomorrow morning the first is another bloody storm

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.566
Especially those who are not destined for the Pavilion

14
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.066
They've never been at odds with you

15
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.666
You are such a good lady to me.

16
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.800
Don't worry about it.

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.233
I've figured out right and wrong

18
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.900
You have a way to know

19
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.933
It depends on whether you have the ability to pry

20
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.166
Open my mouth

21
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.266
Ariben

22
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.966
Retreat without principal

23
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.200
I have the original curse

24
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.733
collateral

25
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.966
13 Prince Lion to the official line

26
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.266
deceive

27
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.266
Please check it out

28
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.066
Ouch.

29
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.866
Ouch.

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.233
Master Xu, stop scolding, stop scolding
