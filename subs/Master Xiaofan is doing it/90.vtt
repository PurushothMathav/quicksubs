00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.766
Your Highness, you go first

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.166
I'll stop them

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.366
What are you panicking about?

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.966
Did you forget what I told you?

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.266
I'll go with you.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.100
chase

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.700
Do you still want to give recalcitrance?

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.500
Our chess

9
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.033
It's not over yet.

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.433
What do you mean?

11
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:27.766
Grandma Wang

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200
What should he do with it?

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.033
Capture the enemy since ancient times

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.633
It's all life and death

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.400
I didn't expect the relationship between you brothers

16
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.300
It's come to this

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.866
Go to jail

18
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.400
Wait until the emperor wakes up

19
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.700
Do I have to order it myself?

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.433
Execute his own grandson

21
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.566
Empress Dowager, you are frightened

22
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.566
Li Chao

23
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.200
You've done another great job

24
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:10.000
I always thought it was too easy for him to surrender
