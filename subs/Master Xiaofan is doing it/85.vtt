1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.033
Yuxue, I was wronged

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.533
I see.

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.700
Phoenix and I both believe it wasn't you who did it.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.000
What is the attitude of Empress Dowager Yuxue?

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.033
The Empress Dowager also wanted to save Her Highness

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.366
At that time, someone mentioned a first prince as the crown prince

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.400
He didn't say yes.

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.866
Now as long as I can save my father

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.766
All problems are solved

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.300
Your Majesty, do me a favor

11
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.833
How is your majesty

12
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.100
Can you cure the poison of the Empress Dowager?

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.633
Weichen is unheard of

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.766
I'm afraid what?

15
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.866
Empress Dowager Weichen is really powerless

16
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.566
It's better to pull it out and cut it

17
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.366
Princess, you can't go in and get out of the way

18
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.333
Empress Dowager Wang Jian, I have a way to save you

19
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.700
Send him in.

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.700
The courtiers see the Empress Dowager

21
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:54.933
What can you do?

22
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.900
Say it quickly, His Highness may be able to save His Majesty

23
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:58.966
What!

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.766
Ms. Chen was affected by tetanus at that time

25
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.366
The imperial doctors in the palace are powerless

26
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.900
It was His Highness the Thirteenth Prince who saved the minister

27
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.700
His Highness the Thirteenth will definitely be able to save His Majesty
