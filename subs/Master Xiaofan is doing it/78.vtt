00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.700
Let him live in our house for the time being

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.766
See if it works.

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.100
Of course you can.

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.033
We have so many rooms

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.233
Let Rongrong girl stay first

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.033
Lin allows it.

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.966
Are you really living in the front?

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:16.000
Be careful, sister, get up

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200
After going through so much today

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.700
Must be terrified

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.400
Your Highness, we are not going to check the account book

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.866
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.300
The accounts are divided into many parts

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.000
Looking for it one by one to find the Year of the Monkey and the Moon of the Horse

15
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.200
I plan to.

16
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.833
Hide them all

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.966
catch it all

18
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.100
how

19
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.100
You'll know in a while

20
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.066
Isn't that the First Prince's bodyguard?

21
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.433
What is he doing here?

22
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.866
He's here to give us ears

23
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.166
It's windy and rainy, so I can't go out.

24
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.433
Your Highness, what does this mean?

25
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200
My eldest brother is still quite cautious

26
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.600
It's telling them not to come out.

27
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.700
How can you always hide?

28
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.233
Come out and bask in the sun
