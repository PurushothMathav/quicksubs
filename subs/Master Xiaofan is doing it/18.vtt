1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.900
What ant?

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.000
What honey?

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.266
What thread?

4
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.933
I see.

5
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.366
Just put honey on one end of the moon

6
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.766
Let the ants in Guangzhou West County crawl on the other end

7
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.300
It will naturally find the pond position and climb to the exit

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.100
The line goes through

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.000
Hmm hahaha good

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.600
As expected of my son

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.533
What about the second question?

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:25.200
The second problem is that the rabbit lifts both feet

13
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.800
After raising their feet, chickens and rabbits belong to the same two groups

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.200
35 heads of 70 groups in total

15
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.766
The missing 24 clans

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.900
The two feet up.

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.966
So there are 12 rabbits in total.

18
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:48.000
This thirteenth prince is really not simple

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.366
I never thought of that.

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.100
His Highness the Thirteenth Prince's arithmetic is also so exquisite

21
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:59.500
Shixian Medical Saint is still affiliated with everyone

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.400
It's amazing

23
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.066
Just read the answer to question 3

24
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.500
What are you still doing?

25
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.666
Read it, Your Majesty

26
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.566
No more below.

27
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.366
It seems that this thirteenth prince is nothing more than that

28
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.266
A mere couplet can't answer

29
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.500
Daqian is also known as the Shangguo of the Heavenly Dynasty

30
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.100
Sinology Yuanyuan

31
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.166
It's ridiculous

32
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.900
Your Majesty as agreed

33
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.166
Your country needs to cede five cities to us

34
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.600
I don't know when to cash it out.

35
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
Who says my big money can't match a broken pair
