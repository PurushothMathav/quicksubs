00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.866
You're courting death.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.633
Yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.766
Yes, that's all

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.900
Stop killing such a tenacious old general

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.200
Blame them for being too weak

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.033
Big money uses force

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
But I didn't expect the rich general

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.433
They are all so vulnerable

9
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.966
It's ridiculous

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.266
It looks like we won this round of contempt

11
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.566
10 cities

12
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.766
Cede as soon as possible

13
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.800
Your Majesty

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.833
The final invasion

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200
General, don't pretend

16
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.166
son-in-law petitions

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:45.000
Then this is the time for you and I not to make you shine

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.433
Don't worry, father, emperor and children have their own way

19
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.866
I don't think you have any big money, right?

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.266
Just like you

21
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.100
I can hit five of you.

22
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.100
What do you mean?

23
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.966
You still have 3 series of live face money.

24
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.666
I see you want to die

25
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.033
2 to die

26
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.500
Yeah, it worked!
