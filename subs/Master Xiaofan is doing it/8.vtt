00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.066
Huamanlou is the same as the two songs just now.

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.366
It's all from you

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.566
Yes, these three poems

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.166
It's all about the students.

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.100
I just didn't think of it.

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.266
The thirteenth prince actually for some false reputation

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.533
He actually did shameful things like impersonating the collar pool

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.266
Wang Zhongjing, do you want to be ashamed?

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.600
Want to jump over the wall

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.066
Haha, this is a poem that generates resentment

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.500
How can it come from an untrained boy?

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.866
Third Prince

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.666
Better to be honest?

14
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.466
13 Brother, don't apologize to Wang Daxue soon

15
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.733
Then get out of the recruiting experience obediently

16
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:40.000
You say I can't write good poetry without experiencing it, right?

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.266
Paper comes ink comes wine

18
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.166
Open your eyes and take a good look

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.400
deserter

20
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.900
Yesterday's day dare not

21
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.200
Don't you see the water of the Yellow River coming from the sky

22
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.433
Run to the sea and never return

23
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.666
Born with my own talent

24
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.300
Thousands of gold are scattered

25
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.066
come back

26
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.066
Ten years of life and death

27
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.933
Don't think about it

28
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.633
Strata

29
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.233
Absolutely impossible to enter

30
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.400
Will be Ling Juedeng

31
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.966
May it last

32
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.566
A thousand miles together

33
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:41.066
Jun buried the mud under the spring

34
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.400
I send it to the world

35
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.066
Snow
