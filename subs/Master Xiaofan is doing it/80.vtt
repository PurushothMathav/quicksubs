00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.800
Why do you still call me Your Highness?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.366
Ah!

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.266
The emperor's humble duties and ceremonial reports

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.500
But it's okay to say

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.966
Chen Yuanxiao wiped us all out

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.266
And took all our books

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.066
Why didn't you say so earlier?

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.433
Didn't I tell you all to hide?

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.400
Chen Yuanxiao cracked all our codes

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.066
How is it now, Your Highness?

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.966
Chen Yuanxiao has already attacked and destroyed the saint

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.600
We don't have much time left.

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.233
I really don't want to take this last step.

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.866
Emperor

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.833
When things come to light, we'll be powerless to come back

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.766
Now is not the time to hesitate

17
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.100
or

18
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.066
Why don't we do it the other way around?

19
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.233
Anti what anti

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.833
You forgot about the fourth

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.400
You take this to Tianzhu.

22
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.233
There's someone over there

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.300
I thought I relied on the emperor that day. How about you?

24
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.733
Oh.

25
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.400
Of course I went to meet that wife

26
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.200
Who says you have to lead troops?

27
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.400
It's really done by the boss
