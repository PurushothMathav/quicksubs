00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.600
This Chen Yuanxiao

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.800
When did you become so eloquent?

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.033
Keep an eye on the complement

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.400
If they find anything

5
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.966
No need to report

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.400
Yes

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.466
Rongrong, you are in such a hurry to call me over.

8
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.533
Did something happen?

9
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.200
Your Highness, the Kushiro of the Household Department found me yesterday

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.033
Ask me to give you something.

11
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.500
Who is Kushiro?

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.633
That's a long story.

13
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.100
Lu Shangshu lived a clean life and served as an official to benefit thousands of people

14
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.000
Unfortunately, he was murdered by an adulterer and died in prison

15
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.533
Now his wife and children are reduced to seeing themselves

16
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.366
I can only make a living by begging

17
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.366
Yesterday because you hit Lord Xu

18
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.233
Kushiro risked his life to send me a secret letter this morning

19
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.666
As far as I know

20
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.700
This Lord Lu is due to corruption

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.466
Sentenced to death by Dali

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.933
It turned out that there was a grievance

23
00:00:58.933 --> 00:00:59.833
Your Highness

24
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.033
This is the heart that the king of the world gave me

25
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.633
Deficit 100,000 two
