1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.466
That's really made by the boss

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.600
No evidence in the absence of evidence over the years

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.066
Every Time

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.400
After New China was defeated by my ex-wife

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.700
It can always be detected quickly

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.066
It's a habit.

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.500
Now I understand

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:21.866
It turned out that my son was helping them make a comeback

9
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.966
Father, what do you think?

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.200
After all, he is my eldest son

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.600
I want to give him one

12
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.233
A chance to confess leniency

13
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.666
It's all up to the father

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.166
I will tomorrow

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.333
I will make you a prince

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.500
Don't let me down

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.266
Don't let down the powerful Dawn people

18
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.900
The son will definitely live up to the trust of his father

19
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.066
Jin Zhe

20
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.666
Do you know why I gave you this name?

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.333
The mother told the son-in-law

22
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.566
The son-in-law was born in Kim Chol-il

23
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.166
So it was named Jingzhe

24
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.666
That's one of them.

25
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.100
What is Meridian?

26
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.233
Time to Meridian

27
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.166
The temperature is warming up

28
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.133
Spring thunder

29
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.266
All things recover

30
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.166
This is my wish for you

31
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.166
I hope you are like the day of the apocalypse

32
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.566
Welcome a new look for my big money

33
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.066
son ashamed

34
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.400
Reach the expectation of protecting the emperor for you

35
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.066
What do you think of 13?

36
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.866
The Thirteen Emperors are intelligent

37
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.766
Of course I can't wait

38
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.666
13 is really brave

39
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.866
Take over the household in just ten days

40
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.900
The huge deficit in the treasury was found

41
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.100
Sin of father and son
