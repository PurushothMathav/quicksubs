00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.633
Better than anyone else

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.400
What a coincidence than the president

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.700
Xiao Chen

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.266
Why are you silent?

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.466
Are you unconvinced?

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:13.466
I'll convince you now, let go, be careful

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.366
Hahahaha

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.600
You see?

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.566
There are sun slaves

10
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.600
Even if you kill me today

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.166
You're going to die.

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.233
evil

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.033
How did I give birth to such a wicked person as you?

14
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.233
Father calm down

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.733
Just shoot Ren slave and leave it to the children's minister to solve the problem

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.566
You want to take care of my sun-shooting slave?

17
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000
Just that wooden pole in your hand with sparks?

18
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.266
What the hell?

19
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.100
I call him the truth

20
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.300
Within the city

21
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.866
I am the truth
