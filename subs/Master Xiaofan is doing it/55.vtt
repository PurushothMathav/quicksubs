1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.400
Deficit 100,000 two

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.366
soft

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.766
Just give me your heart and leave

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.266
The person who stole 100,000 two silver from the rural household

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.200
At least one batch or more

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.466
Your Highness, are you planning to go through this muddy water?

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.000
Not this muddy water

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.333
If I can't meet it

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.933
But I met someone who doesn't care about returning to peace of mind

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.000
Although others think I'm a stubborn child

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
But I still have justice in my heart

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.100
I didn't expect it.

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.200
Your Highness is still such a warm-hearted person

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.666
In the future, tell him when you encounter cooked food

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.866
I got his back.

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.266
What's bothering him?

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.400
I mean let him disappear for a while

18
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.366
To create the illusion of his disappearance

19
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.166
Master Xu

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.966
From today onwards, we will do nothing

21
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Platoon leader

22
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.833
Ugly face

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.033
Your Highness, you are joking again

24
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.366
Here are the accounts for a full 5 years

25
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.266
Even if the account is completed, it will take half a year.

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.500
No, a week is enough.

27
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.600
His Highness prefers brocade clothes to control food habits

28
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.900
Talk nonsense when you open your mouth

29
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.666
Auditing is a specialized discipline

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
Don't shoot if you don't understand

31
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.066
So you're not convinced?
