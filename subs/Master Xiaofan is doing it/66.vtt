1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.966
The son believes that this battle cannot be won

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.266
If you can't win, my former army will come down like a tiger

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.400
Little Heaven Helped

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.700
Why can't I win?

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.666
Father-in-law

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.033
Please listen to me

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.166
I don't think it's going to happen.

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.500
How can we win a battle that cannot be fought?

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
This is the first time I've heard this

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.300
Hurry up and call

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.866
I just found out that the treasury was stolen from the household department

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.066
Tianzhu was on alert

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.400
This is obviously a warning to me

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.966
If we dare to check

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.700
Then make our large treasury even more vulnerable

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.066
The two old men are calculating

17
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.100
100,000 the army

18
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.033
What's the daily charge?

19
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.266
Tianzhu is an engineering room again.

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.300
Consumes more

21
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.833
They'll attack for 100,000

22
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:53.900
But let these heavenly nations have the same name and border

23
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.866
What about the smaller countries?

24
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.200
Where is the majesty of my big money?

25
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000
Then let them retreat

26
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.000
Retreat

27
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.200
You won't have a plan to retreat from the enemy

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.466
Don't choke on your intestines

29
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.200
A knowing son is better than a father

30
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.866
Yongzhen
