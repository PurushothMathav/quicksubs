00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.033
Daughter-in-law, shut up for me

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.200
What do you mean by getting together?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.800
What you said is too bad

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.633
wife

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.466
I didn't mean to make you look too ugly

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.500
But since you're talking about it

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.166
So it was a showdown.

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.500
Yes, I did it on purpose.

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.600
Your girlfriend will soon be my wife

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.233
And you know why?

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.200
Because I'll give you flowers for anything you want

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.066
And you

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.600
How to do evil

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.233
What a sin

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.600
Qin Feng, you don't have to pay too much attention

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.800
What about your brother?

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
He is also out of kindness

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.200
He can't bear to watch me suffer with you

19
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.600
He's the director of the Down Group.

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.100
How about you?

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.566
Just one can't get along

22
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.900
Mud legs who can only run to Beijing

23
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.466
What qualifications do you have compared to him?

24
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.766
Haven't you always been better than me?

25
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.633
I've always wanted one.

26
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.433
But I can't even see my wife

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
Who did you give me to help you?

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.500
Qin Ming, shut up for me

29
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.900
Why are you shutting up?

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.666
Am I wrong?

31
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.800
I am now the director of the Down Group

32
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.500
What is he?

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.866
You can tell me what to do.

34
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.500
Just a director?

35
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.000
You are really majestic

36
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.833
Just a director

37
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.800
Chu Baozi, do you know that the Tang Group is in the south?

38
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.466
How much energy is saved?

39
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.200
Not to mention second to none

40
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.433
It's sort of at the top.

41
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.966
Even the lowest employees

42
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.666
Tens of thousands a month

43
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.066
Not to mention our director

44
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.366
You're right!

45
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.666
You, a migrant worker, can't even come into contact with this class

46
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.666
It's normal not to know

47
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.633
Ordinary This is the gap between us

48
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.800
But now deal with

49
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.466
They are all as big as the eldest lady of the Tang family

50
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.666
What else is there?

51
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.100
If it weren't for the dead old woman giving birth

52
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:12.433
You're not even qualified to meet me, haha.
