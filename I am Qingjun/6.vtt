00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.300
Marriage is such a big deal

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.233
Can you stop blocking me?

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.100
I don't want this broken house anymore.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.133
Just go, okay?

5
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.466
I'm begging you, okay?

6
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.266
Jin Ming

7
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.700
Pick him up for me

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.433
Ok ok ok I take it I take it

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.566
How can I leave now?

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.700
Can we go?

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.700
Haven't seen you in a few years today

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.566
I thought you would grow

13
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.666
I didn't expect you to become more gluttonous

14
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.000
I hate the poor and love the rich

15
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.266
I don't even recognize my own mother

16
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.633
Otherwise, what do you want from me?

17
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.300
Aren't you waiting for a stinky farmer all your life like you?

18
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.466
I tell the truth

19
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.100
If you weren't for me, you would still take care of that relative

20
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.966
Don't dare to talk to me

21
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm not qualified

22
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.300
This is where every inch of land is expensive

23
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:49.100
Even Zhigao saw that the Qing army was playing nine acts here

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.066
And I

25
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.566
Can play in the same place as Lord Qing Jun

26
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.966
Do you think we still belong to the same class?

27
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.366
Forget it. Forget it.

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.466
I told you this and you heard it

29
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.533
If you don't want to leave, you won't leave.

30
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.800
Don't you just want money?

31
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.500
How much will I give you?

32
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.500
Is 10,000 points enough?

33
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.000
Go, go, go

34
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.800
Return to this afterlife

35
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.166
It seems that you have killed someone in the middle of the night

36
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.666
You apologize to mom now

37
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.200
I can ignore it.

38
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.500
I apologize to you.

39
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.166
Do you also match?

40
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.266
I'm giving you face now

41
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.566
I don't want to be embarrassed just now

42
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.700
Does your mom really take you seriously?

43
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.966
Lao Tzu, the person who sees you is cheap and dead

44
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.766
Let's fight a war and give it to me
