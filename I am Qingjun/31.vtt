00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.066
Dad, what's the matter?

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.166
What's up?

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.266
Our largest special project in Shaanxi

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.966
It was cancelled urgently.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.033
Then hit

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.366
Ah Zhang Family Master

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.833
Don't scare yourself

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.300
Maybe there is something wrong with the project.

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.500
Just a word from this hairy boy

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.300
How can you possibly cancel your project?

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.166
Yes!

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.766
If there is a problem, it will be a problem for the three of us together.

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.866
How can it be just your family?

14
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.900
Hello, all the sea bridges have been cancelled.

15
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.100
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.400
Divestment is not Mr. Wang

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.566
The project is halfway through

18
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.766
Why did you suddenly withdraw your investment?

19
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.700
Hello mom

20
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.300
What the hell is going on?

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.200
i

22
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.033
It won't really cancel the cooperation, will it?

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.000
How is that possible?

24
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.033
Isn't he just pretending?

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.200
You shut up

26
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.900
Request the army

27
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.566
I was wrong, I didn't know Tarzan.

28
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.533
You can't do this

29
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.100
In that case

30
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.300
My Xuanjia will lose half of its property.

31
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.300
It's me who offended you when I was blind

32
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.566
But my Lee family went up and down for this project

33
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.800
I put too much effort into it.

34
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.166
It's a heavy loss for you to cancel now.

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.766
The curtains were stolen

36
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.900
Go down, my lord

37
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.166
What else do you mean?

38
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.500
I just bumped into you

39
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.933
I will save him

40
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.366
Save him just so you can look at him

41
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.433
3 Everyone

42
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.566
Did I just give you a chance?

43
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.633
It's a pity that you don't know how to cherish

44
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.500
Make amends

45
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.466
late
