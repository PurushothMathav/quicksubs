00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.966
Qin Feng, who cares if you like it or not?

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.000
You really consider yourself a dear king

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Do you have a say here?

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.400
Qin Feng, are you crazy?

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.733
Today's banquet

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.766
It's for that big guy

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.766
Open for the king of Beijing

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.700
You're talking nonsense here

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.800
The challenge is not ours

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.300
It is the supreme blue army boy

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.766
You need me more

12
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.033
Is it just to create a sense of presence?

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.033
It's a pity

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.033
You don't realize the true value of identity realization.

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.633
Merit means 12 hundred feet multiplied by blood

16
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.066
It took seven, seven, forty-nine days to extract

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.200
It symbolizes our Dai

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.600
The tribe rises and falls on that little determination

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.900
This seal is not to be touched by the powerful

20
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.166
Those who are not wealthy should not be touched

21
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.633
Not to be touched by the glorious

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.033
Non-Kowloon Exalts cannot be touched

23
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.033
Oh, it does?

24
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.166
Certainly.

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.366
This merit means the future of my white head

26
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.366
It is the hope of twelve heads

27
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.400
What about you?

28
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.233
I throw the world away

29
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.200
How can you be sure?

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.266
I am not the One who is glorious for all eternity

31
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.100
You can put on airs in front of the 12th centurion

32
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.800
Are you really not afraid of death?

33
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.666
Hahaha Twelve Cities of Lust

34
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.566
Just a bunch of mediocre people

35
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.300
Delusions to show off the blood of filth

36
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.066
In exchange for eternal glory

37
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.966
Ok so

38
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.000
I will fulfill you

39
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.100
Don't tell me that

40
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.000
Are you selling the seal?

41
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.900
Sister-in-law, there are hundreds of companies to choose from

42
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.633
Those with wings like dragons must die
