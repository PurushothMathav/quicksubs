00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.600
Qin Feng, why are you?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.766
What brings you here?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.700
You are surprised

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.133
Did you do this occasion?

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.833
Qin Feng, you don't even consider your own worth

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.466
wife

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.566
We wanted to go up in bronze.

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.000
The Qing army sued you

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.166
I didn't expect you to dare to trespass

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.266
It's killing itself

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.600
Now that you know this is a happy side

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.700
How did you get in here?

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.100
I brought them in.

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.500
I got an invitation letter from the Qing Army

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.300
Don't think that Youxuan will support you

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.633
You can do whatever you want

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.466
We've figured it out.

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:39.200
Make sure you're not alert at all

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.966
You are just covered by that Xuanque

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.500
I think he is wrong. Xuan Que, as the ninth master's person

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100
The company did not discriminate against the three major families

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.900
That's not right either.

23
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.900
They delivered it to your head today, that's right.

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.200
Jiu Ye will come later

25
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.700
Wait for the ninth master to come

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.966
You guys are just waiting to die

27
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.566
It seems that he is an adult that no one can be

28
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.233
Would you like to introduce to us

29
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.700
Fart name

30
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.366
You laugh.

31
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.366
This person was picked up by my house

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.333
One by one

33
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.433
Lie

34
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.366
Mud can't hold up to the wall

35
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.300
Exactly.

36
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
He's just a storm-eating trash

37
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.966
When you see a powerful woman, you jump up

38
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.566
It's just a disgrace to men

39
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.366
OK

40
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.833
And such disgusting people

41
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.900
Yes, our three families are out of justice

42
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.666
I wanted to fix him

43
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.833
I didn't expect to be put together by him

44
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.766
So

45
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.900
No wonder I'm so down

46
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.300
This kind of person also comes to worship the banquet

47
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:46.200
Today, the top 100 families welcome the Qing army

48
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:49.300
Waiting to be canonized as a gift for the soldiers of the hundred battles

49
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.900
As soon as the one arrives here

50
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.266
There is no room for ordinary tombs

51
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.200
The presence of this son here is an insult to that one

52
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:58.633
Do you hear me?

53
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.366
This is not you

54
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.100
Go away

55
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.233
Do you think a mouse poop ruined a pot of soup?

56
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.133
Spread it out get out

57
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.300
Get out get out

58
00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:12.666
Get out get out

59
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.633
Get out

60
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.600
Get out get out get out
