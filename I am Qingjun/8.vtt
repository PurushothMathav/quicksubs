00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.900
Let go and die on me

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.500
Don't want to die

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.500
Inspire me

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.766
Don't think you have nothing but horsepower

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.866
So what?

6
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.466
The world doesn't rely on talent to speak

7
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.033
It's about power.

8
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.266
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.766
I am now the director of the Down Group

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.366
If you dare to tease me

11
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.100
The Tang Group won't let you go

12
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.566
This brother is the place where the Qin army held the green ivy industry

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.200
You can be here

14
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.966
Qin Jun won't let you go

15
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.800
Yeah? Well, your dad could try

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.833
Kneel now

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.266
Apologize to mom

18
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.600
Why should I kneel?

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.166
Am I wrong? He gave birth to me

20
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.100
These are all things he should do.

21
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.300
Stop it you big devil

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.366
Is it okay to be smart?

23
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:58.866
you

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.666
Zhang Feifei

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.233
This is the engagement you told me about

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.066
That's right, I'm engaged to your brother Qin Ming

27
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.266
Why didn't you be invited?

28
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.833
You don't have to be angry

29
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.200
I just feel like seeing an ex at an engagement party

30
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.866
Unlucky too

31
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.033
I'm afraid my husband will be upset.

32
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.366
Yeah.

33
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.833
If you don't want to see it

34
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.000
This kicks him out

35
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.366
Everyone is here

36
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.600
Let him find a place to squat

37
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.466
Just him.

38
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:40.400
He will never come to such an upscale place in his life

39
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.066
Can't eat such high-end meals

40
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.200
Yes, yes, or my baby is kind.

41
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.833
If you want to stay

42
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:51.233
Just find a corner and squat and wait for the food to be served

43
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.766
Not if you come again

44
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.000
You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome.

45
00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:01.166
What a pair of resistance

46
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.666
That is Qin Feng

47
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.066
Apologize to my husband soon

48
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.600
You want me to apologize to him?

49
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.700
I know I cheated.

50
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.266
You have grievances

51
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.466
That's normal.

52
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.100
But don't throw it on your husband

53
00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:17.433
He's innocent. He's innocent.

54
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.466
He can't get along with his brother's girlfriend
