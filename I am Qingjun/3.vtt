00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.033
What did you say

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.366
This is what he gave me.

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.766
Blind date. We're getting engaged today

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.433
Would you like to attend our engagement party?

5
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.700
You won't see it that high

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.100
you

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.033
When did they get together?

8
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.766
From the day you left

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.833
He's not like you, an ordinary dog

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.400
He is a top student

11
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.466
Just a few years out of society

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.466
It became the top talent of the Tang Group

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.500
The future is limitless

14
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.000
Very big.

15
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.566
Just this bag.

16
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.200
Just top your salary for a year

17
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.166
So our relationship for several years

18
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.966
Nothing beats a designer bag.

19
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.266
Qin Fang, don't be too naive.

20
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.866
You can never afford what I want, Chen Feifei

21
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.600
As long as I marry him

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.300
I can cross this class

23
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.433
Enter this Colosseum of Fame and Wealth

24
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.900
Become the sun that everyone is grateful for

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.300
Do you know what you have lost?

26
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.633
Shouldn't want to say

27
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.700
What I lost

28
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.666
It's your heart that loves me deeply

29
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.100
What a pity!

30
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.333
Qingfeng, don't be too childish

31
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.200
If it weren't for you calling me over the years

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.233
For the sake of money

33
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.633
Do you think you are still qualified to see me now?

34
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:30.233
All I lost was a poor ex-boyfriend

35
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.800
I couldn't watch it in a previous life

36
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.966
Today it's all you in my hands like a grass sword

37
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.400
What you lost

38
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.200
It's the chance you've been longing for

39
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.800
You've made it crazy, you're on top of power

40
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:50.966
Haven't seen you in years

41
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.200
Eyelids are really long

42
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.700
You even proposed to me with a broken ring

43
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.300
What kind of face is bragging here?
