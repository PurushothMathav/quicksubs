1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.766
Yan Zhanshen took that kid's actual engagement

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.600
No wonder he dared to be so arrogant

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.400
But I put this end today

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.200
He's asking for nothing.

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.766
Yan Zhanshen actually broke off the marriage after being the moon for so many years

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.900
Really

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.500
You really have information with him

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.266
Should be happy to arrange privately

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.566
He appreciated me back then

10
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.233
I want to condense me and Ye Ni to make a marriage contract for us

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.200
But I had explicitly refused

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.466
I didn't expect him to

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.166
Or did you prepare this wedding privately?

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.566
Shut up

15
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.566
You're just a failure

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.033
The change of Yingying taking the hole

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.800
What right do you have to refuse you?

18
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.266
What right do you have to let my mother go private?

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.566
Just getting married

20
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.666
That being the case.

21
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.833
This engagement ceremony cannot be counted

22
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.266
Why are you doing this?

23
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.800
Why should I do this

24
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.000
That's because I'm the only one who rejected you

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.300
And you have no right to refuse

26
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.866
You don't look at what you look like now

27
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.300
If I were you

28
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.633
I can't wait to find a place to drill

29
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.466
It will not appear in front of a world full of strange curses

30
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.066
That means you don't have enough confidence

31
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.200
Not confident enough

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.633
Ok please let it go and I'll tell you

33
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.866
Did you know that today's ivy feast

34
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.466
And for whom is this wrong and fair?

35
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.833
For whom?

36
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.866
I'm not afraid to tell you

37
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:21.066
I am about to be canonized as the king of Beijing

38
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.800
And I am also the first queen of this summer

39
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.766
This is the gap between you and me

40
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.266
An angel

41
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.566
An underground

42
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.833
I'm about to go to the sky

43
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.066
And you're just a chicken wahaha

44
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.400
Guard the queen

45
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.600
Yuan Yichang's canonization ceremony has not yet begun

46
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.700
How can you be so sure that you can be canonized as a king?

47
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.300
Hmph, aren't you afraid that this position isn't you?
