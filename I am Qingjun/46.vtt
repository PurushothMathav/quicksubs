00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.133
Yeah, I was.

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.033
Yes, to say guilty

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.866
That you let go

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:10.200
Hundred ethnic groups control the 12 gods, no matter which group

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.100
Can easily destroy your door

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.966
How dare you incriminate us?

7
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.800
Do you know what you did today?

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.933
Are you using your life to challenge my authority?

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.900
Here is our offering to that adult

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.133
It's us Dai

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.900
The highest worship for that lord

12
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.100
And you uncover it in advance

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.500
Boy, you really don't know how to live or die

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.100
Do you know

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.866
As long as we say a word, we can destroy your nine clans

16
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.200
Boy, I'm afraid you don't have hands

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.633
You open this.

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
What kind of regret do you have to bear?

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.033
Here today

20
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.300
I don't understand. No one's available.

21
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.400
Dare to correspond to the patriarchs who are so arrogant

22
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.200
No remorse

23
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.100
Wuhan doesn't need to entangle with him anymore

24
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.866
Take him down now

25
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.900
Yeah, talk to him

26
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.600
It's just playing the piano to a cow

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.766
I think he just wants to make things worse

28
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.100
Screw up the factory

29
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.366
Let the big guy take his anger at me

30
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.700
Take it out on you

31
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.066
Your posture is too high

32
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.466
plaintext

33
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.133
We are giving you a chance.

34
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.233
But you don't know how to cherish

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.266
Daughter-in-law, I told you a long time ago

36
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.400
It's not up to you to offend anyone here today.

37
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.300
You have to die and dare to go to fairy

38
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.666
Before the congratulatory gift, there was Nurse Xuan Que

39
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.166
But this is a feast

40
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.133
Who dares to protect you?

41
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.166
The situation of the families

42
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.400
Previously, he relied on having profound acupoints to become seedlings

43
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.700
Pretending to be the Qing army

44
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.866
Now to get my attention again

45
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.200
Deliberately overturned the congratulatory gift

46
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.200
This is a felony

47
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.233
Do not intrude

48
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.300
Boy, you actually stained the little third army

49
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.266
Hate our hearts

50
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.600
Then we are invincible against you

51
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.966
Do you know how long it took us to prepare him?

52
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:56.000
Didn't I spend a lot of effort? No matter how long it takes to prepare

53
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.366
As long as I'm not satisfied

54
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:58.333
Then it's useless

55
00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.133
Humph

56
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:01.033
flashy stuff

57
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.833
To know what
